    I give up. Most people do that before even starting when they see that the series has over 400 episodes. I've watched 490 of them and I just can't take it anymore! I really don't like dropping a series and I generally try to avoid doing so, but the reason to do so is quite plain and simple: this show is a waste of time.  
 
The first few story arcs are really interesting. I've even rewatched the episodes where Zoro joins Luffy a few times since it just really draws me in with its excellent story and characters. It's not like I just ""got used to"" the series and the newer episodes ""seem"" dull because of that; those early episodes were really just amazing. The filler episodes throughout the series are intolerable and water the series down greatly, but the main story arcs are quite interesting and can really hook you. The series kinda loses its charm after a couple hundred episodes, though they still keep it pretty fresh when they introduce a new main character. It's the filler that kills this series, really. 
 
One Piece appears pretty cartoony at first glance, maybe even stupid. Some of the characters look pretty cool despite that (such as Zoro and Trafalgar Law), and it's a little refreshing to see a group of characters that aren't just a bunch of sexy beasts. Characters like Usopp just look unappealing and ridiculous at first, but even a guy like him can seem really cool as his character develops. I've got no problems with the artstyle, and the series has many serious moments that are convincing enough to make you worry about the characters despite the cartoony look.  
 
The long opening themes are one thing, but the long recaps at the start of each episode are brutal and highly unnecessary. I think this problem starts around the Sky Island arc and continues on for the rest of the show. 
Anyhow, I'm quitting at the Marineford war. That was 30 episodes of Luffy endlessly running towards the platform shouting ""ACE!"" while Ace would shout ""LUFFY!"" and ""K...kh...hh...!"", whatever that means. Half of it was just random pirates and marines firing their guns towards off the screen. I think the ""war"" atmosphere was really just boring and not suited to One Piece, especially since the all the fillers made it appear very slowpaced. The show lost its emotion and intensity. There are better things to come, but I can't handle these worthless fillers anymore. One Piece is nearly 500 episodes long and it isn't going to end anytime soon; they're only halfway to One Piece and the real battle is just beginning. I'm sure there'll be peaceful people living happily in the ""New World"" just like in the rest of the Grand Line, though, despite the fact that it's supposed to be the most incredibly dangerous place in the world.  
30 episodes of straight bullshit. Well, I'm sure the worthlessness and stalling amounted to at least 100 episodes. There are some truly incredible series that are only 24 episodes long; you'd do well to watch some of those instead of sitting through One Piece fillers.  
 
I recommend reading the manga instead; no fillers and the art is more interesting. I think I'd give One Piece a 9/10 if it weren't for the fillers. The last point would be saved for an ending, which this series will never have. Don't watch the fillers for completion's sake like I did; they really aren't worth it.

    Well not long ago started watching this series and now have ""watched"" quite lot. And I don't get it how people have so high opinion of this series. 
 
Story:  
Is quite boring honestly, if you like watch same joke 10 * in episode for 700+ episodes then this series might be for you. Nothing interesting happens until Summit War arc. In that arc there was interesting development in characters and connections to other characters. And during that time there Luffy did as he peaces and didn't give a damn what other we're thinking. That is only reason I gave this series even 6, would have been 4 or even 3 without that arc. But at Fishman Island arc it went to back to boring as there doesn't seem to be any reason for any fighting again. 
 
Art: 
Well quality in art is like a roller coaster in this this series, some scenes it is good and some bad. But I like old feeling what art style gives and that's why I rated it to 6. Could have been much higher if quality would be stable good. Color themes are also pretty good in this and seems to be they're not scared to use colors what I'm happy about. 
 
Sound: 
To be honest, nothing too fancy but quality is mostly stable if some side character voice actors not counted in. Music could be better in some situations but good overall. 
 
 
Character(s): 
Well characters in this series are 90% of boring or fanservice. There is literally none character development in this series so I don't get it how this series are even going on anymore. 
 
Luffy: 
Pretty good character but I have watched over 500 episodes and still personality exactly same as beginning of first episode of whole series. As a fighter he is getting stronger but it don't feel like it at all because still sidekicks gives him hard time. I know when they go deeper in Grand line there are stronger mobs but honestly. 
 
Usopp: 
90% of boredom. He don't have growth at all in whole series as person. As a fighter he has grown a little but his personality ruins this character wholly for me, crying help or crying to Luffy to stop all the time. That's everything this character is, nothing more or less. I don't even get a reason of this character because of... 
 
Tony Tony Chopper: 
Chopper are pretty similar to Usopp but he gets things done if situation requires it. Chopper is as character is direct upgrade for Usopp. He cries also Luffy to stop and cries help but if situation requires it he can get things done what Usopp don't. Pretty interesting character and this one I would keep in this series. 
 
Nami: 
This character is 100% of fanservice and nothing else. She don't have anything to give to series and can be also annoying you-know-what. I hoped when I first time saw when she was rescued by Luffy that she is just side character who drops after she's arc end but no. 
 
Zoro: 
This is most interesting character in whole series, he is actually only one who has grown as person in whole crew, and that's pretty sad considered how long this series has already run.  
 
Sanji: 
After Usopp this is second most boring character in whole series. He has not developed as person nor as fighter at all. And his obsession to women joke is gone too long and got boring already. I actually hope he dies on nosebleed somewhere. Not gonna miss him at all. 
 
Brook: 
Can be quite interesting character but feels like he's going to be in same category as Sanji. Same joke over and over again and does not do anything new. At first in Thriller Bark arc he seemed really interesting character and was quite good but when I went to Luffy's boat he went to bottom, he honestly don't give anything new to series and seems to be he is just there for filling Sanji, Usopp and Chopper jokes so they don't repeat same joke 3 jokes whole episode but 4. 
 
Nico Robin: 
Sometimes just for fanservice but much better character than Nami. Personality much better and honestly in a big role to drive story forward. 
 
Franky: 
Last but not least, this character actually got interesting design as a character and he has grown quite lot. I hope they don't ruin this because Franky got a lot potential as MC. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Well as I said in story, this series is quite boring and I have been ""watching"" this. Only ""watching"" not watching cause it's hard to enjoy same jokes over 500 episodes. And usually I keep this rolling for background sound so when I'm doing other things. I actually had quite high hopes for this series because this has run so long but looks like expectations was crushed hard. Most likely I watch this series till it ends but just for background noise, not for entertainment. 
 
Overall: 
Well this section is more like TL;DR for me 
- Do you like watch same joke in every episode till you die? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- Do you like series what are 90% fanservice and otherwise boring? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- Do you like characters don't grow at all (even after 500 episodes)? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- If you want to watch this you can skip straight to Summit War arc cause there really isn't any development in this series so you won't miss anything.

    You know what I really miss? The good ol' days of shonen anime/manga where something could have an outrageously bizarre concept with an equally bizarre universe which can be light in tone and set the stage for some grand adventures to unfold. Nowadays, it seems like most shonen anime and manga try to be all dark and edgy in order to defy those sort of preconceived notions that all shonen anime and manga is light-hearted and/or childish. While that's all fine and dandy, I can't help but feel that we're losing something special in the process of this sort of transition from light-hearted adventures to dark and grim tales of survival.  
 
With the cancellation of the Hunter x Hunter anime (further compounded by the manga's hiatus), it seems like brutal survival games chock full of fan service and outrageously violent battles are all that's left of shonen series. Then enters One Piece: one of the most popular shonen anime/manga series out there which is still going strong despite being around for 15-something years. It's had a lot of ups, downs, and more than its fair share of criticism levied against it but all things considered... it's something like a breath of fresh air in this stale climate that shonen anime/manga seems to have immersed itself in as of late. 
 
***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING*** 
 
One Piece takes place in a world completely dominated by maritime travel that's currently experiencing something known as the ""Golden Age of Pirates."" The ""Golden Age"" was brought about by the death of the so-called Pirate King, Gold Roger and his final words about where he's put his entire life's fortune. Whosoever finds Gold Roger's treasure, the eponymous ""One Piece"" will then become king of the pirates (or so the legend goes; I question how finding a dead man's riches will automatically make you king of all maritime bandits, but that's beside the point). 
 
While many people might dismiss this concept as childish, this is one of the very things I love the most about One Piece. You want to know why? The reason why is that despite the simple set-up would seemingly get repetitive over a short span of time, Eiichiro Oda steps up to the plate and manages to deliver plenty of adventures that are so grand in scope that you'll have a hard time trying to keep your jaw attached to your face. The way that Oda manages to so is quite clever and something that I never really get tired of: the fact that the Grand Line (the place where the vast majority of One Piece takes place in) is pretty much a perfect canvas to unleash his creative mind. 
 
The Grand Line is literally a place where common sense won't get you anywhere. Conventional means of navigation are impossible because each island emits its own, strong magnetic field that interferes with regular compasses. Instead, you need a special compass called a ""log pose"" which basically leads you to the next island and that island is completely random. In addition to that, it takes a certain amount of time for the log pose to reset itself and lead you to the next island. The log pose can change at a moment's notice, so you can't even trust the calm of the seas or the weather. On that note, weather in the Grand Line is incredibly chaotic due to the irregular magnetic field that encompasses the entire area.  
 
On the topic of weather, every island in the Grand Line has its own climate, fauna, and such. Some islands are cloaked in perpetual winter while other islands are quite literally stuck in prehistoric times with dinosaurs and everything. Going back to the log pose, sometimes it can point you to seemingly impossible locations. Would you believe that there's an entire arc in One Piece that takes place on an island IN THE FUCKING SKY?!?! I'm not even kidding. Whenever Eiichiro Oda puts his mind to it, he really can surprise you with what he can come up with. In fact, when it comes down to the world-building, only Fullmetal Alchemist and Hunter x Hunter come close to matching it. Of course, One Piece and HxH opt for a sort of ""make it up as you go along"" approach while Fullmetal Alchemist is more carefully crafted. 
 
A rather important part of One Piece's universe is the existence of the so-called ""Devil Fruits."" Whosoever devours one of these strange fruits will be given great power at the expense of their ability to swim. It should be noted that throughout the entirety of One Piece (thus far), there is absolutely NO explanation behind the mechanics of Devil Fruits and their effects on humans. Some people will undoubtedly take umbrage with this, but I don't. One of the things that irritate me the most when it comes down to shonen anime and manga in recent years is the fact that there's always NEEDS to be an explanation to EVERY SINGLE THING.  
 
Don't get me wrong, there's always going to be shit that will need explaining, but I find it infuriating whenever there has to be some sort of pseudo-scientific explanation given for practically EVERYTHING that happens to our characters whenever they gain/use a superpower. In One Piece, the Devil Fruit superpowers are indeed important but they're not the overall focus of the plot. I suppose you can consider the Devil Fruit powers to be analogous to Nen from Hunter x Hunter or chakra from Naruto if you need something you can compare it to (even then, it's not quite like those two). Another thing to note is that no two Devil Fruits will bestow the exact same power. 
 
***THE STORY*** 
 
One of the biggest problems that the One Piece anime suffers from is a VERY slow start. Like most shonen series, the story of One Piece is told arcs. The first 61 or so episodes encompass what I like to call the ""East Blue"" arc (which comprises of several smaller sub-arcs). Basically, it's where Luffy is recruiting his crew and the various adventures that follow suit. By the end of Episode 31, the final crew member joins and the team is ready to set sail to the Grand Line... although that's not quite the case. After Sanji joins the team, Nami briefly defects as we go into an arc that dives into her own back-story before she returns and becomes a permanent fixture of the Straw Hat pirates. 
 
It's not that these episodes are bad or anything, but I just got done telling you all this amazing shit that happens in the previous section and yet none of that shit actually goes down until AFTER these episodes. Well... to be fair, these episodes were produced well over a decade ago when the manga itself was still rather young. I suppose it's like Phantom Blood from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in the sense that it at least provides us with the foundation for these grand adventures to unfold. At the same time, I can't help but feel like Toei Animation could've at least skipped over some of the more superfluous stuff from the manga. Whatever, it's too late to do anything about that now. 
 
Aside from that, the story of One Piece is pretty damn good. For a series that's been going on for well over 15 years, it's surprising as to how consistent the overall story quality remains across the board. Yes, there are points where the storytelling takes a downturn, but this generally happens in filler arcs and whenever there's some excruciating padding in an episode to stretch out the chapters (more in the next section). Of course, there are also moments whenever you can tell that Oda didn't quite bring his A-game to the table in a particular arc. Yes, a man like Eiichiro Oda can also suffer from dry spells where his storytelling isn't quite up-to-par with what he usually brings to the table. He IS human, after all. 
 
Considering that One Piece is a shonen series, it's no surprise that themes of friendship and loyalty are quite prominent. What's more is that in a vein similar to ""classic"" shonen series like Dragon Ball, it's going to be a tale of adventure that is rather light in tone (for the most part). Does this mean that One Piece is automatically childish garbage? HELL TO THE FUCKING NO. Surprisingly enough, One Piece is fairly capable of taking itself seriously when the time comes for it to do so and what's more is that friendship/loyalty will ALWAYS be themes no matter what since those are hallmarks of the genre. No sense in complaining about something that's part of the course, you know... 
 
The overall arc structure of One Piece is fairly predictable, but that's not an inherently bad thing since it does offer a degree of consistency with the storytelling. The basic formula generally goes like this: the Straw Hats land on an island -> residents of the island hate them -> the Straw Hats meet the island's bad guy(s) -> they beat the bad guys -> residents of the island now love the Straw Hats. Keep in mind that this is simply the framework for an arc and the way an arc actually plays out may very well end up surprising you. This goes back to One Piece's greatest strength: giving us amazing adventures that are so grand in scope to the point where you can't look away from the screen for a moment. 
 
***THE FILLER*** 
 
Surprisingly enough, Toei Animation did a relatively good job of remaining filler-free in a series as long as One Piece (roughly 98 episodes). It also helps that most of the filler arcs tend to be rather short (typically 2-5 episodes) across 670 episodes. It also helps that a good portion of them basically got their origins from ideas that Eiichiro Oda wanted to put in the manga but couldn't for various reasons. But does that mean they're worth watching? Well... I suppose you can go ahead and sit through the filler but the G8, Ice Hunter, and Ocean's Dream arcs are the only ones that I consider worth watching since the other filler arcs tend to be more hit/miss. 
 
Going back to how Toei Animation mostly managed to subvert filler, it was through adaptation expansion. Eiichiro Oda is a guy who packs quite a lot of detail into his stories, so it's easy for writers to expand upon concepts he brought up but didn't quite flesh out. Unfortunately, Toei Animation has this nasty habit of taking things too far. While the adaptation expansion was good enough that occasionally bordered on great in the first half of the anime, the latter half of the series (Episode 405-onward) is where Toei Animation's adaptation expansion takes a downward turn for the worse. 
 
After the Sabaody arc, Toei Animation decided to up and scrap the idea for filler episodes entirely and instead adapt the chapters at a 1:1 ratio. Considering the fact that not every chapter will have ~20 minutes' worth of stuff to adapt, Toei Animation had to improvise and they did so by means of VERY excruciating padding. It REALLY got ridiculous in the Marineford arc where you're basically panning over shots of the crew and have to put up with Buggy's pitiful attempts at comedy. It even got to a point where they showed one character looking for milk before going back to a fight. Now with that said, it DOES get better and it's really noticeable after the time skip but it's too little, too late by that point since the time skip is fairly recent (around episode 515?). 
 
***THE CHARACTERS*** 
 
Considering the fact that One Piece has been going on for 15+ years, it's no surprise that there would be a LOT of characters. A good deal of them show up later on in the show/manga's run, but the vast majority of them are more or less just there for one arc before the focus of the story shifts to the next arc. Surprisingly enough though, even characters that have been around for just one arc were fairly well-developed and rather likeable like Dr. Kureha whose only appearance is in the Drum Island arc. There are certain characters who stick around with the Straw Hats for more than one arc (i.e. Vivi), but they're few and far between. Despite that, they receive more than enough screen time to the point where you feel like something's missing once the time comes for them to depart. 
 
For the vast majority of One Piece, we're stuck with the Straw Hat pirates: a rag-tag bunch of misfits with their own share of issues that also have such large bounties on their heads that rival Vash the Stampede's. The leader of the Straw Hats is none other than the rubbery Monkey D. Luffy. For lack of better words, Luffy is well... an idiot. What's more is that he's a gluttonous idiot in a vein similar to Goku or Naruto but thankfully he's not THAT extreme. A good benchmark as to how much you'll like Luffy is how well you can tolerate his airhead behaviour since it does get rather ridiculous at times. Regardless, he's got quite a few good traits to back him up and without Luffy, there would be no adventure, which would fucking SUCK. 
 
My favourite character would definitely have to be a tie between Roronoa Zoro (the swordsman) and Sanji (the chef). Why? Well... it's a combination of cool factor AND the fact that they play off of each other (and Luffy) rather well. I just can't get enough of their constant snark toward one another, nor can I ever get enough of Zoro's santoryu (3-sword style) or Sanji's ridiculously powerful kicks. That's not to say that the rest of the Straw Hats are forgettable, boring, or whatever because that is NOT the case at all. What I love most about the Straw Hats is that despite the predominant focus on Luffy, each member receives a good amount of development and time to shine on-screen. 
 
Of course, what are protagonists without their villains? Suffice it to say, Eiichiro Oda's creativity leads to us having quite a lot of interesting villains. Some of them are fucking AWESOME (like Enel in the Skypiea arc) while others are well... lame and stupid (like Buggy in the Orange Town arc). Honestly, this is something you'll have to put up with over the course of One Piece. You think that a limitless well of creativity is free? Oh fuck no! While Eiichiro Oda manages to hit the mark 95% of the time, there are moments where you have to put up with some of his ideas for villains that aren't stupid in an awesome way but are instead just well... stupid (ref: Buggy). Thankfully, arc villains aren't the only ones that the Straw Hats have to deal with. 
 
Considering the fact that the Grand Line is so vast in scope, there are a LOT of threats that the Straw Hats have to put up with, two of which being the Marines and the Seven Warlords of the Sea. The Marines are essentially your maritime police force which deals with pirates while the Seven Warlords are essentially government-sanctioned pirates. In exchange for a cut of the treasure that the Seven Warlords find, the government allows them to basically pick off smaller pirate ships that try to traverse through the Grand Line. Whenever an arc deals with one of the Seven Warlords, there's no doubt that it will be intense.   
 
***THE ART AND ANIMATION*** 
 
If the seemingly childish concept, Luffy's stupidity, or the sheer length won't repulse you, chances are that the artwork will make or break your overall experience. Personally, I feel like Eiichiro Oda's artwork has quite a unique charm to it. What I love most about it is that there isn't a single anime/manga series out there that has this exact art style (and before you say anything, Fairy Tail does NOT count). I can understand why some people wouldn't like it since it's rather cartoony and most shonen series nowadays tend to have realistic character designs. Regardless, Hunter x Hunter has a similar ""cartoony"" art style and yet people praise the everliving Christ out of it so if you're gonna talk smack about One Piece's artwork but not levy the same criticism against Hunter x Hunter, you're too stupid for words. 
 
Of course... there is one little gripe I have with the art style and that is the fan service. Seriously... One Piece's fan service is something that I can never quite get accustomed to despite having watched the anime AND read the manga for well over 6-7 years. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't find huge tits on top of a skinny waist and lanky limbs to be that attractive. If that weren't bad enough, post-timeskip Nami's outfit is essentially a bikini-top and low-riding pants. Come on, Oda! You expect me to believe that Nami just went through a growth spurt? Don't lie, she paid Chopper to give her a boob job and you know it. Same goes for Nico as well! But, I digress. While I can certainly complain about it all I want, the fan service isn't as bad as OTHER popular shonen series (i.e. Akame ga Kill, Fairy Tail). 
 
As for the actual animation itself, it pains me to say that Toei Animation doesn't really have that good of a track record when it comes down to animation quality because they have this nasty habit of producing several long-running anime series alongside one another as they're airing while rotating between animation teams that tend to vary wildly in terms of quality. There's a tendency to go off model every few episodes and it's actually gotten a lot sloppier in the more recent episodes with character proportioning changing at the drop of a hat (let's hope that these animation errors get fixed in an upcoming Blu-ray release or something). 
 
The first 206 episodes were more or less par for the course from Toei Animation. There was a lot of good, a good deal of penny pinching along the way, fights were decently animated but nothing worth getting excited over, etc. Episode 207 is when the show makes the switch to HD and a 16:9 resolution and from that point forward, the animation became more fluid and the artwork became a lot cleaner as it ditched some of the line effects and such that it used in the earlier episodes. A general rule of thumb I use is that if an episode I'm watching on Funimation's website has been dubbed, I'll watch the dub instead because dubbed anime generally uses the footage AFTER it's been cleaned up of most of its off-model errors. 
 
***THE SOUNDTRACK*** 
 
Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot about One Piece's OST that really caught the fancy of my ears which is quite bizarre since there's usually one or two pieces of BGM that would stand out to my ears while watching. The OP/ED themes are fair enough, and I do have a fondness for a few of them (although I forget their numbers and I'm WAY too lazy to look them up at this point). I will say this though: Skypiea had some pretty damn good BGM even though I couldn't remember any specific tracks that stood out. 
 
***THE DUBS*** 
 
If you've ever done a basic Google search on One Piece, you'll probably find out that it had a rather turbulent distribution history here in the USA. It was initially picked up by 4Kids Entertainment and was aired on FOX during Saturday mornings (only to eventually air on Toonami during Saturday nights). Unfortunately, 4Kids has this nasty habit of editing the anime they license WAY past the point of compliance with FCC guidelines. For a full list of 4Kids edits, you can Google it. Most One Piece fans will urge you to stay away from the dub and honestly... I can't really blame them for that (especially now, since Funimation has been distributing One Piece for damn near 7 years and their dub is significantly better). 
 
But if we were to take away the content edits that 4Kids was responsible for and focus solely on the actual dubbing, you'd be quite surprised. The actual dubbing isn't quite bad and if you want a real surprise, Marc Diraison (the voice of Guts in the English dub of Berserk) voices Roronoa Zoro in the 4Kids dub of One Piece. It's no stretch of the imagination to think that he's my favourite performance in the entire dub. Erica Schroeder, the voice of Luffy did a fair enough job in her role but some of her lines came off as a bit forced and unnatural (although I blame the ADR director for that, since the woman really is a talented voice actress). 
 
As for the Funimation dub, I'd have to say that it's pretty damn good stuff. It's common to hear dub haters say that Colleen Clinkenbeard as Luffy and Brina Palencia as Tony Tony Chopper make their ears bleed, but that judgement is really left up to you. Both Clinkenbeard and Palencia do a great job with the roles they've been given, but I will concede that they can get rather irritating at times (of course, I blame the characters since their voices can be grating in the Japanese dub too). However, my favourite performances would definitely have to be Luci Christian as Nami and Christopher Sabat as Zoro (although I wish that Marc Diraison was still Zoro's voice actor because Guts). It's nice to hear Luci Christian's regular voice and Christopher Sabat not being a large ham and I wish more Funi dubs would play them straight rather than having Christian and Sabat doing exaggerated roles. 
 
***ANIME VS. MANGA/HOW TO WATCH*** 
 
When it comes down to anime vs. manga, the manga always wins hands-down for one simple reason: lack of padding. Were it not for Toei Animation's overuse of padding, I'd heartily recommend the anime over the manga since it does have quite a lot going for it. However, it should be noted that you can alternate between the anime and the manga so that you don't have to plough through 760+ chapters or spend 6 months trying to catch up to the One Piece anime. Thankfully, the One Piece wikia can tell you what chapter(s) the episode you're watching is adapting and vice-versa. 
 
Rather than sitting through the first 61 episodes, what I recommend is reading the first 100 or so chapters from the manga (it's not as much as it sounds, trust me) and then moving over to the anime at Episode 62. If you ever feel like an episode is dragging on in pace, look up the episode on the One Piece wikia and see what chapter(s) it's adapting, then go ahead and read the corresponding chapter so you don't have to sit through 20+ minutes of something that you could easily read in less than 3-4 minutes. If you feel like the chapter you're reading is confusing or whatever, look it up on the One Piece wiki and then watch the corresponding episode. It's as simple as that, really. What made you think you had to sit through all 670+ episodes to begin with? The manga does exist for a reason. 
 
***FINAL THOUGHTS*** 
 
On the whole, One Piece is a very interesting beast to tackle. I like to imagine One Piece as the boss of the Big 3 with Naruto and Bleach standing by its side as its bumbling and incompetent henchmen. While the sheer episode count and turbulent distribution history may put you off from watching it, don't let that scare you. Whereas Studio Pierrot only began adapting Naruto and Bleach in 2005, One Piece has been going on since 1999 so of course there's going to be a stark difference in terms of episode count. For a series that's been going on for 15 years and counting with no end in sight any time soon, it's amazing as to how Eiichiro Oda is able to keep up this level of creativity. Are there low points? Of course, but thankfully they aren't THAT low and are instead very brief. Don't buy into the hate against this series since it's actually quite lovely. 
 
***ALTERNATE ANIME RECOMMENDATIONS*** 
 
1) Hunter x Hunter (2011) 
- The bonds between Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio are similar to the bonds shared between the Straw Hat pirates and what's more is that they both take place in bizarre worlds where fanciful occupations set the stage for tales of grand adventures just waiting to unfold. 
 
2) InuYasha 
- Both InuYasha and One Piece are more about the journey rather than the destination itself. Both shows comprise of large arcs that are split up between many smaller, easy-to-watch sub-arcs and standalone episodes. Both shows also put a lot of emphasis on friendship and trust (although InuYasha does so for different reasons; it IS a partially romantic story, after all).

    ONE PIECE EITHER GOING TO BE A LOVEABLE ANIME OR A HATEFUL ANIME FOR YOU. BELOW I WILL SHARE MY EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING ONE PIECE. 
 
 
Story 
 
The story is simple. It's somewhat drowned on most of the time. The fighting is ok and very entertaining to watch at times. On the other hand, the action is bad compared to other anime. The most stupid thing is how Luffy just randomly pulls power out of nowhere when needed -.-. Let him lose properly, let us see him gain strength, not just randomly give him magic powers in the next episode. Hunter x Hunter is a great example of showing to the audience how Gon gained his strength. 
 
Overall the let-down is in between the start of the arc to the end (meaning pretty much the whole story). During these times one piece finds a way to add lousy speech, action and can add a cheesy sad story to make the audience try to relate to it, just doesn't work. For this reason, I am giving the story 4/10 
 
Animation & Sound:  
 
One Piece animation is unique and can draw you in. The arts get better and better as the story progress. It's the same story with sound. However, you would expect the success of one piece would let it improve the animation standard to 2013/2014. It still lacks quality compared to animation that came years before now. For this reason, I am giving both of them 5/10 
 
Characters:  
 
One Piece universe has a wide a wide range of characters. The main crew is fun to watch but also can be annoying at times. The downside is newer characters are just not getting their screen time worth. We don't want to wait for another 100 episodes to find another fact about them. Well, I guess they done it to drown the anime on. Another downside to characters I would say is the villains for Zoro. I mean come on! One of the biggest badass in the anime yet they can't even be bothered to create a more interesting character without a cheesy or disinteresting story to fight him. Overall I give it 5/10 for the poor background information on the characters we are given. 
 
Overall:  
 
Overall, if this is the first anime you chose to watch, you might enjoy. If you have seen other anime that set the bar high, such as FMA, then you will be disappointed. The newer arcs just feel like Oda is doing his best to try and rake in money rather than continuing putting soul into the anime. 
 
However, I would say that it can be enjoyable for a younger audience or someone who is new to the anime world. 
 
Overall rating for the anime: 5/10

    One Piece is honestly the most amazing series I have ever watched or read.  The plots are well-written and hold my attention without taking themselves too seriously and adding unnecessary drama that causes me to lose interest.  The characters are some of the most endearing, well-developed and likable characters and the art, while not appealing to me at first, took a grand total of TWO episodes to get used to before I found it to be incredibly unique and my favorite anime art style to date. 
 
While this series has serious moments, it never stops being funny.  Something important about the humor in this series is that it's ORIGINAL.  None of the typical jokes that are recycled in every anime and even the serious moments I was talking about are sprinkled with clever and endearing humor that keeps me watching. 
 
Something that is important to me in a series is the characters.  If I don't like characters, chances are, I'm not going to like the series.  The lead cast to One Piece has won me over in their own individual ways.  There is not a single one I don't like and I seriously thought that was IMPOSSIBLE. 
 
I could go on and on about this series but it's not my job to tell you EVERYTHING great about it!  Just take my word on it!

    One Piece is a freak show. With over 800 episodes aired so far, there's no end in sight. 
 
So One Piece is a battle shounen anime, which follows the adventures of one Monkey D. Luffy, who aspires to be the King of the Pirates. He is the captain of the Strawhat Pirates, a crew consisting of both males and females, who all play an important role that helps keep the crew going. 
 
Luffy is our typical, dumb shounen hero, who is a glutton, grins a lot, and is happy-go-lucky. He is a rubber man, whom can stretch parts of his body, gaining this ability after eating one of these ""Devil Fruits"" when he was younger. The rest of the Strawhat Pirates all have unique personalities, with their own quirks, and you're likely to find a favourite among them. Although, some of them can be annoying sometimes. 
 
The art style is something you'll either love or hate. It can be either appealing or unappealing to look at. In my case, I don't have a problem with it, and that there are worse-looking anime than One Piece. It's quite cartoony, and has a distinguishing look to it. The designs of the Strawhat Pirates look fine. But it has some of the ugliest-looking supporting characters you will find in an anime. 
 
The animation is ass. Produced by the infamous Toei Animation, the animation is average and just looks outdated compared to other long-running anime that aired (or is airing) around the same time. It's just disappointing and I know it could look better if another studio had done it, or if Toei put more budget into it like in the films. Along with this, the fights (which are mindless) just look unimpressive and are dull compared to the fights in other battle shounen anime (like Naruto and Bleach), and it also uses a lot of still frames. There are also no fluidly-animated episodes for the episodes with high-action scenes either. Barely any of the fights are memorable, they don't have strategy, nor do they have any rewatch value, and the choreography for the fights are just lame. This isn't a show you want to watch for the fights. 
 
The sound effects are somewhat annoying. I personally hate the sound effect of a heart beating. The music is a mixed bag. It's upbeat most of the times, which goes well with the theme of the show. The first opening sounds amazing, and made me revisit the show frequently early on, but other openings are just painful to listen to. The main characters have their own theme music, which I always liked the idea of in anime in general, and they fit with the characters. The voice acting in both the sub and dub are great. I personally prefer the dub. 
 
The pacing is fine from episodes 2 to 301 (episode 1 was slow-paced), but it becomes permanently slow-paced starting from episode 302. Most of the filler episodes are surprisingly decent. Though in latter episodes, there are almost no filler episodes to speak of, which results in snail-pacing for the canon episodes. 
 
There are some things that have always annoyed me while watching this show, other than the fights. There is a lot of crying in it, from both main and supporting characters. Not only that, but they make these ugly, exaggerated expressions on their faces when they cry. It's probably a staple of the show, but it feels like they went way overboard with the tears, and it gets irritating the more you watch it and hear them wailing. Accompanying this is the constant melodrama. Hate that shit. It tries too hard to make the viewers cry. 
 
Another thing is the lack of deaths. Basically, for the most part, nobody dies in this show (outside of flashbacks). Like nobody. This got noticeable the more I watched it, and I found it a bit annoying. Like I wasn't expecting any characters to die within the first 100 episodes or anything, but damn, does it take a long-ass time for the first actual death to take place in the show (we're talking about hundreds of episodes). I don't mind lack of deaths in an anime that has a realistic setting, but One Piece has a fantasy setting, and it's unacceptable to me for a fantasy anime like this have virtually no deaths. What also irks me are the moments where the show makes it look like somebody has died, but later on you find out that they didn't. After realising how rare deaths are in this show, I just roll my eyes whenever a character, in a non-flashback scene, says that they're going to kill or decapitate another character. And speaking of flashbacks, why do most of the characters have to have overly tragic backstories? I get it! They had it rough! Stop making me feel sorry for everyone! 
 
I also don't really like the humour; it's just childish and involves slapstick and retorting. In other words, it's mostly unfunny, at least to me. And I just don't like the general tone of the series. You often see these minor, nameless characters scream their lines to whatever is going on in front of them in a silly way in dramatic moments, and it's pretty annoying. And the anime in general is a bit too goofy at times compared to other battle shounens. 
 
Overall, the main characters are the strongest aspect of the anime, and is the biggest reason why I try to continue to watch the anime. I admit it's fun to see the Strawhat crew's adventures. It's a pretty silly show, not taking itself seriously at all. However, the abundance of melodrama might be a turn-off for some people. The arcs are also formulaic for the most part, so it gets repetitive too. If you have a lot of time on your hands, and like adventure, then consider checking this show out. If you're looking for a battle shounen with spectacular fights, then I suggest you look elsewhere. The fights in One Piece are crap. I myself grew tired of watching this show after the Thriller Bark saga. The show peaks in the Marineford arc, and there's little reason to continue watching this show after the timeskip.

    I never write reviews but I think this series deserves it. 
 
NOTE: This is obviously not a bad-ass/cool-mysterious guy on a seemingly complex mission that is trying to mind-fuck you. This is SHOUNEN. Straight-forward and easy to understand for younger viewers and deep enough for the older. This is business as well as entertainment ei: MAINSTREAM. 
 
Sure it has a VERY generic shounen anime base-line but it has a lot more depth to it that only a mature audience can understand. This can't be seen within the first 20 episodes; it's one of those things where you have to grin and bare with. Most likely, your efforts would be worthwhile. 
 
I'll just follow the trend and comment on the sections; starting with the weakest qualities. 
 
 
 
1. ART: (6/10) 
 
This is a HUGE issue and it takes a lot of perseverance and patience to get used to the art style of this anime. It took me about 6 months to get used to it. 
At first, everyone looked like overly-hyper, 12 year-olds being too loud and just looking at them made me want to stop. Noodle-like arms and legs, weird anatomy etc. the list goes on. But if you power through however long it takes for you to get used to the art, the characters appear as catalysts of nothing but pure emotion. This puts you in a weird, neutral position. You know that the art isn't great but you can't seem to imagine this series in any other way. Changing the art style becomes a bad idea. 
 
The only reason why I'm giving the art style a 6/10 is because it's so damn hard to swallow. In the end, anime isn't just eye-candy, it's storytelling first and foremost and I think One Piece knows this very well. 
 
 
 
2. SOUND: (8/10) 
 
The sound in this series isn't bad but it isn't spectacular though it does have golden moments during heavily emotional scenes. What IS fantastic is the seiyuu's performances throughout this colossal series. They (generally) capture the essence of their characters, flaws and all. For example: The annoying idiot aspects of Luffy. Mayumi Tanaka was THE voice for Luffy. No one could fill her shoes. 
The opening themes usually sets the correct tone for the series; an up-beat, ""let's go on an adventure"" kind of feeling. Corny? Maybe, Childish? Very, Effective? Absolutely. 
For what One Piece is and what it does; the sounds in the series definitely supports. It's doesn't suit my taste in music but it's very ""One Piece"", which adds to the experience. 
 
 
 
3. STORY: (10/10) 
 
The depth of this story will surprise anyone. I had very low expectations for this series, having started years after it began airing but after watching it for a while, I truly believe that this is one of the best shounen stories to date. 
 
Despite being from a very obvious shounen base-line, One Piece delivers fantastically. One Piece explores society in a very extreme manner; often exaggerated to enhance the hype of the moment. You can see that this is deliberate because of how everything within the story drives to one particular moment.  
 
I don't think One Piece's story should be compared to reality because it's simply not realistic: It's not supposed to be but we can certainly compare and relate the ideas and themes within the plot. 
 
This is a truly well thought-out plot, beautifully integrated with the characters to provide a very wholesome experience. If you sit there and watch it -searching for flaws- you will be missing the point of One Piece. If you approach it with a ""What the hell but whatever, lets see how this goes"" attitude, you are guaranteed to enjoy this plot more. 
 
NOTE: Fillers are NOT stories, they fill empty spaces. That's why they're called 'fillers'. They are meant to be half-assed to buy time for the author. You can't judge a series by fillers, that just means you're stupid. 
 
 
 
4. CHARACTER: (10/10) 
 
First impressions are important when it comes to characters. Unfortunately, One Piece fails at this and fails pretty hard. We are introduced to a very typical hero, off to be some king of something and be the biggest, baddest man on town: in this case, the world. Then we meet a typical tough-guy/Mr. Cool. etc. 
The thing that is amazing about the characters in One Piece is that though they appear very standard; they somehow manage to break their cookie-cutter mold. Each character basically has one strong quality about them but that one aspect of their character is what makes each character special. 
 
They then develop as the story progresses; being faced with challenges each character's physical, mental and emotional state to their limits; tests their judgment and instincts. They are never perfect but it's how they work around their shortcomings and utilize their few strong aspects to survive in the hostile world of One Piece, that puts the characters of One Piece in a league of their own. 
 
Once you get used to the whole atmosphere of this series, you will find that you won't be able to help but feel very attached to almost every character you come across. 
 
 
 
5. ENJOYMENT: (10/10) 
 
It's fabulous. I can't think of any other series with this much depth; in character design and the execution of the plot. There is a lot to read into in this series, people just need to take a deep breathe and allow themselves to be drowned and suffocated by it. It won't kill you I promise. 
 
 
 
6. OVERALL: (10/10) 
 
I obviously love this series. It's completely underrated and is constantly being flamed by 'mature viewers' that think they've actually grown up just because they watch brain-raping anime with what SEEMS like a complicated plot when it's actually just another generic anime to their related genre. 
 
This series deserves a lot more than that. It is worth the trouble of getting used to the painful art style. It is worth credit. There IS a reason why it's popular. 
We, in the Western world tend to think that it's mind-boggling to see that THIS is one of their most popular animes but I think it's our arrogance and denial that is causing this negative reaction. Apparently, anime is just pretty colors, characters with big eyes and crazy hair, and big tits or a scifi-novel with moving pictures. 
 
One Piece is a fantastic combination of business, entertainment and art. It's obvious why this series is such a success in it's homeland. It's just tragic how a disgrace to mankind (4Kids Entertainment) got hold of this gem before it could reach a wider audience. 
 
This is not a masterpiece; but it's pretty damn close to being one. 
There is no such thing as a perfect show.

    OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! 
 
From a scale of ""over 9000"" to ""too damn high"", how autistic am I You say? 
well judging from watching this garbage I'd say a 9 will suffice for the  
after effect. 
 
I like it, but in all honesty its not good. 
So To begin my review, Let me start of my experience of watching OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!!  
 
Please do understand this is not me taking shots at this series in any way, this is just me expressing my views on the show in terms of its merits and failings to see if its as great as fans really suggest this to be. 
 
For a long time you see I've watched the series of One Piece back on television during the great Toonami era which basically is The western TV version of saying HELLO JAPAN!!  
 
The dub for 4kids was what I watched at first and no surprise It deserved it at the time because the show wasn't that special from the get go from when it started off to where its currently at now with DOH Flippin Flamingo.  
 
And yes I went to funimation and the japanese for there take on its characters voice and music etc which still did not make any difference apart from seeing some dumb unrealistic violence and yet the show still hasn't grown up to where I am now in the series, it could be possibly I'm not acknowledging the show in the right way despite that I'm still watching it or maybe Oda just isn't Goda anymore 
OH NOOO! THE HORROR!!. 
 
The Basic story premise is about pirates with super fruity power ups known as Devil Fruits (Laughing excessively here at this point) 
More to It lies with our main character Monkey D Luffy a wannabe young man who wants to be king of the pirates. 
(Wow had no idea there was royalty to begin with pirates but oh well) 
 
Luffy strings up a group of people to join his pirate crew within different arcs of the story to help in searching for a treasure known as OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! that was foretold by the greatest pirate known as  
Gold D Rodgers who apparently hides the treasure in the Grand Line (because thats the name of the big game I guess?) and by the time our hair turns grey we might actually find out as to why and what it is, (that is either you or Oda stays alive until then.) 
 
At the time of Gold D Rodger's death sentence he makes his last infinite statement that he says he left everything in OnePiIISSWuaaaa! 
 
Oh yes Gotta love that D eh Boys and Girls ? 
 
So far in the midst of everything the story tries its hardest to keep building up and gets messed up at an early point right after 50 episodes which was supposed to be its greatest strength but also becomes its greatest weakness.  
 
You probably wont believe me for saying this but that weakness being is WORLD BUILDING.  
 
Basically what I mean by that is constant dragging on of episodes to make you feel that you are on a long journey of some sorts but in reality,  
All it really is doing is STALLING on the part of the mangaka Oda Eiichiro's Art design and writing for whatever wage he seems to be earning on demand at the moment and yes its fact since the industry supposedly is hard on the condition of writers on a weekly basis. In other words the PACING OF THIS ANIME IS AWFUL.  
 
Sounds familiar?? Its pretty much very similar to Hunter X Hunter mangaka Togashi Yoshihiro's approach in the story that constitutes for being excessively greedy in its approach, then again quite a lot of Shounen animes are like that I guess. 
 
Its like the anime is holding up a sign saying:  
HEY NOTICE US PLEASE!! PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF US! OR WE'LL KEEP SLOWING DOWN FOR WE SEEK THE ATTENTION!!!!  
 
Anyway enough of the issue at hand before some of you start feeling like I'm trying too hard to be negative on purpose. 
 
Think to yourself THIS, If this was such a great shounen for examples like death note or even FMA Brotherhood why the need for SO many episodes??  
 
Why am I so serious..?? 
 
very simple answer, Again its World building! which demands many SLOW pacing in a lot of episodes, So much so that they probably need LOADS of spin off specials and movies like you haven't watched enough of this already as it is in and outside of this franchise,  
(also referring to Japanese one piece merchandise of course.) 
 
by the time you get your toys at whatever time period this show continues, you ALL would of already grown out of this at some stage in your life unless your an Otaku then fair enough. 
 
This is No Rant here, I'm only stating the obvious critical point towards the show as a whole. But like I mentioned its because of this World Building this  leads to the major reason why the story at most becomes tedious and below mediocre at best on a consistent level in almost EVERY Arc.  
 
Oh and also FILLERS whether the fandom wants you to know or not know, there are a lot of filler characters which also includes badly forced gags for no progressive purposes except for you to question say ''Hey maybe I should watch something else for the time being,'' and me being an honest critic of this generation I will gladly say this, that You should not be force to be put through too much of the same stuff that you don't really want to SEE in a long series like this. 
 
Can we be honest and say for any anime watchers out there that loads of episode can harm World building because of timing and pacing problems such as this?  
When you are chock full of content like this, it should be constructed and executed better! Never mind the BS on the whole it started in the 90s kinda nonsense. 
 
YOU have the content for viewers to be engage in the show yet this anime stretches out the same shit you already witness before without some even realising it (Naruto I'm looking at you on this notion here).  
So don't go into this series thinking there ain't gonna be any fillers because I can most assure you there are, and quite a lot of them even if some of the extreme fandom don't seem to believe so. 
 
The Art is okay and at the same time can look very BAD in terms of the details of a lot of characters. marines look stupid and quite similar to one another and just well fodder really, 
 
females in this series turn out to have the same physique as every other hour glass shaped female in the show. wait is this fairy tail??  
(Oh boy I might of hit the nail on that one) 
 
Big tall men have extremely wide bodies and extremely skinny legs for no reason, at least whitebeard is the more convincing one out of them. 
 
Other characters which includes non human characters look ridiculous and just too nonsensical to be taken seriously not matter what dragon ball like power they seem to possess. 
almost like I'm watching a Disney cartoon back in the day if it was on LSD.  
and for the love of god why is usopp's nose a DILDO?? 
 
I don't care what third dimension of Disney this is suppose to be?  
THIS does not appeal to me thank you. 
 
Now on to The Power schemes and structures of OnePiIISSWuaaaa! such as  
Paramecia:  
Body manipulation over their own bodies, environment, or produce substances. 
Logia:  
having the power of natural elements or force of nature. 
Zoan:  
Transformation of species and inter-species hybrid forms at will. 
 
Ah, you would think this category would be solid?  
While some powers in the series I'll admit can be used to good effect, others can look completely ridiculous and nonsensical even in their own category which for the most part makes the power balance of this series  
even more unbalanced.  
 
Oh and lastly 
Haki AKA (Haki of the Color of the Conquering King): Domination of the wills of others is the dumbest made up BULLSHIT! in the entirety of this franchise. 
(Oh wow Conquerors Haki! OMG! That guy just looked at another person and that person fell DOWN!! OMG!!) seriously? 
 
NO SERIOUSLY,  
Don't get me started talking about the different fighting styles in this series, its lame and not worth mentioning for they are like an excuse for characters that have to fight for the sake of having fights as their only true purpose and nothing more. 
 
Villains in this show are typically One dimensional, There the kind of villains that like to displays cruel tendencies to other characters that you really wouldn't care for, 
BUT I guess because the straw hats appear (Oh Whoopie) You are force to unfortunately,  
at times It can seem some what tiresome Especially if you are already familiar with this Shounen pattern again and again and again and AGAIN.  
 
How long has this series been going on for? (No Seriously) 
 
So now on to characters where the show for the most part kind of develops, but only due to back stories to further a fully purposed plot for them later on from the get go but it never really makes ground breaking attempts to carry along in this stride in every arc which is a real shame. 
 
So this wouldn't really be shocking up to this point, ESPECIALLY if you have already watched a shit ton of episodes till the current episode you are at right now. 
 
Main Characters The simple short version. 
 
Luffy: IMO, as the Lead character he is one of the most uninspiring main character leads I've ever seen in shounen he has 2 fixated moods DUMBASS Or Constipated Raging Man child, Take your pick. 
 
Zoro: is useless in direction making the punt of his efforts in lots of situations where he is lost at every turn very stupid which in turn leaves his three swords style.  
But then who cares when you see characters like Killer Bee from naruto who uses his own 8 swords style So right off the bat what so impressive about this 3 swords style?, Haki Right?, ''the only answer to just about anything dumb in this show, thats cool I get it.'' 
 
Sanji: is basically Brock from pokemon as he is just a generic character who tries to be a hit with the ladies and never gets any including that he is also a chef and STILL never gets ANY WOMAN or PUSSY. Poor bastard.    
 
Franky: I guess you can say he is the Cyborg technician of the ship who thinks he is SUPER MANLY but most of the time he is just a complete Super douche mentally and physically speaking. 
 
Nami: is Tragic navigator turned tragic Fan service. which gets dudes thirsting ''WHeres that nami Hentai at!!?? 
 
Chopper: I don't want to know any further about this annoying Doctor Yogi Bitch. 
 
Brook: Probably my favourite straw-hat pirate out of them all but Oda sometimes devalues his character like others. 
 
Nico Robin: is Tomb Raider but with a cool ability if I might add. 
 
And to be fair I liked the back stories of the characters. 
 
However, what I didn't like was over using the same sad theme for each of their themes with streams of over exaggerated tears. (talk about milking moments like these here to give people quickly them feels.)  
which gets old really fast. 
 
As for the sound department, its lacking but by no means bad, it suits whatever mood you could be feeling in this long ass snail pace of a series. the voice acting quality were few and not so many. 
 
Animation wise Can look really decent when they put there time into it like marineford for example and a lot of other times can look pretty abysmal most of the time according to Toei Animation. 
 
Overall am I enjoying this series? I am trying to, but because of those obvious glaring flaws on the surface still exist just like the treasure OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!!! 
 
I'll admit I have put this on hold during the arc of Doh Flippin Flamingo because I still intend to finish what I started. otherwise why go in over 600 episodes deep just to drop it? 
You see I'm a watcher not a reader of forever long mangas so I intend to keep it that way plus I have no time for comparisons between the anime and manga I have better stuff to do in my long life so I leave you with this. 
 
If you want the most silliest longest Shounen adventure ongoing where everything changes with the times except this then by all means give this a shot you might end up loving it, just not in the same way it has been for me.  
 
I can be sure I'm probably not the only one.

    Ask any person on the internet what their favourite kind of warrior is and you are bound to get one of these 2 answers. Ninja or Pirate. Now we ALL know Ninja\'s are a plenty in anime. But Pirates? Try finding a anime about that! 
 
Eiichiro Oda to the rescue! 
 
The legendary Pirate Gol D Roger. Once acquired everything a pirate could. But before he was executed he told people he hid his treasure \&quot;One Piece\&quot; at the end of the Grand Line. This started the great age of pirates! 
 
One Piece is set in the time of pirates. Even though there are references to real pirates. Bellamy, Alvida etc, its more of a fantasy world. And what a fantasy world it is! Weird creatures, giant monsters and people with a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; ability. Devil Fruit grants the person who eat it unique abilities such as transforming their body, or giving them special skills. The one consequence is it takes away their ability to swim. 
 
One of the people who ate a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; Is the young man Luffy. Blessed with the Gomu Gomu fruit (Rubber) He is a rubber man. and he wants to be the \&quot;Pirate King\&quot; (The person who acquires \&quot;One Piece\&quot;) He and his crew of weird but unique characters set of to the \&quot;Grand Line\&quot; to find One Piece. 
 
Eiichiro Oda created some really amazing characters! Rorona Zoro a swordsman who uses 3 swords. Liar Usopp, Navigator and Money maniac Nami, Chef and Love freak Sanji, Reindeer misfit Chopper and more. Even though the characters seem a little bland at first after a few episodes their characters really start to shine. 
 
Humour is a really big part of the series. You will constantly laugh your ass off at the weird and just downright funny humour this series has to offer. But its not all comedy. Heck no! Fans of action and drama will also love this series. the fights are simply incredible! with the Devil fruit users being the highlights of the series. But just like that the series can take a much darker turn. And will certainly manage to bring a tear to your eye. (Nami\'s background being one of those times DAMN YOU ARLONG!) 
But it never turns into a emo fest. 
 
Its a pretty long series (counting over 310 episodes) and even though there are some filler arcs. It just keeps getting better and better.

    I haven't written a review in almost a year so i might as well start with this 
 
80% of all user made reviews will be positive no matter what. The best way to evaluate anything is to read the negative reviews as well. This is a good rule to go by for anything (games, movies, appliances, etc) With that being said I'm not giving this series a 10.  
 
Quick Review: 
   - Story (4/10) Its an infinite loop story, shounen boy being the greatest in the world and it follows him in all his wacky adventures.  
   - Art (6/10) It is indeed a very well animated series but you can easily see many common ways to for the studio to cut corners.  
   - Sound (8/10) Voice acting is top notch, everyone has a wide range of emotions but some overreact too much in one episode. Whats with all the yelling? 
   - Characters (7/10) You'll either love em or hate them (or both) Regardless you''ll have your share of favorites and luckily you will know all about them.  
   - Enjoyment (8/10) Main story arcs are great but what grinds it to a halt are the long drawn out situations in the vein of the Dragon Ball series.  
 
 
 
Full Review: 
     I kept getting bugged and bugged about when i was going to pick this show up. Ever since 2004. Fast forward to 2008 and I finally picked up and started watching this show from episode 1. I started watching this show with very limited expectations since everyone keeps hyping the hell out of this show. And to be honest, the best way to watch this show is to have very low expectations. Because as soon as the story arc for obtaining Nami started (eps 031- 044), I definitely fell in love with this series.  
     That story ark had everything a shounen anime should have, comedy, drama, action, and serious business. Basically an edge of your seat roller coaster ride trying to figure out what will happen next. Sadly, the story arc's like this are far and few between. The structuring of most arc's usually focus on one or two of the main characters which is perfect for a long running series like this. Don't get me wrong, alot of the adventures are good clean fun which most will enjoy. It's fine if there's no continuity what so ever and plot holes you can fill a 10 gallon trash bag in. It's all about over the top slapstick adventures and it does that well, even perfectly.  
 
     So why in the hell did I give the story a score of 4? I could make a 10 page essay if I listed them all but the main issue is its whole premise. It is a LONG RUNNING shounen anime. That means they will do anything and everything to make a story arc as long as possible. A perfect example is that the opening AND closing credits will average between 90 to 150 seconds each, a last episode recap will last around 5 minutes , and a next week preview will last for about a minute. Add all that up and that roughly adds up to ~15 minutes of non essential story telling. FIFTEEN MINUTES!! Granted, new story arcs wont have as much time shaved off to start but the typical formula will repeat itself every time. But even then its like why bother watching last weeks episode if you can almost tell half of last weeks story today? Its an infinite loop that we're doomed to be in.  
     Since they are a long drawn out stories, they also suffer from the Dragon Ball virus. Having a face off between good guys and bad guys for 30+ episodes and essentially 'filling' in the time with flashbacks or side stories really insults the viewers intelligence in my opinion. They even have the gall to replay back story arcs that lasted upwards to 10 episodes and 'rehash' the arc into one or half an episode. I could have easily skipped over 260 episodes if i knew they were going to do that. I know it is to acclimate new young viewers to how their lovable characters came to be, but isnt that what dvd's are for? Or at the very least, don't bother to tie them in to a story arc.  
     One more thing I must mention, try not to think too hard when people look like they're going to die one minute and the next, they're up and jumping around like nothing happens or any inconsistencies like that. It will make your head explode if you do.  
 
If you are willing to forgive the aforementioned problems with this show (or any long running shounen anime) I'm sure you will notice they do carve alot of nice stories that you will more than likely enjoy. As the actual stories told in the series just look so much fun. It's like watching Indiana Jones NONSTOP. Although it will take forever for them to tell you a story, you'll either be laughing crying or enjoying the wackiness that is One Piece.   
 
The creator did do a wonderful job of making VERY unique and non static characters, although some might appear typical or cookie cutter, they usually do something completely opposite or you will discover things you never thought would happen (inconsistencies aside). On top of that, the voice actors are very memorable and fit their characters awfully well. Although most of them yell more than i would like, the sheer number of cast members is staggering and is hard for me not to be impressed. I agree I am not a fan of a few of the main characters but knowing so much about them (due to side stories) its hard not to cheer for the straw hat crew! 
 
This series is far from perfect, but it is very enjoyable.

    One Piece recounts the story of Monkey D Luffy, a young man who wishes to become the Pirate King; and the rest of the crew of the Mugiwara ('Straw Hat') Pirate crew, each of whom join the crew to realise lifelong dreams of their own. 
 
Luffy ate a Devil's Fruit as a child, more accurately the 'Gomu Gomu' fruit (gomu means 'rubber'), thus his body took on the form of rubber, enabling him to stretch and inflate himself at will - though the downside for anybody who eats a Devil's Fruit is that they can no longer swim: something of a disadvantage for a pirate. Luffy is a bit of of a unique character in all of the anime series I have watched: he's not smart, but he's not stupid. Perhaps 'simple' is the best way of describing him, as he has the same thoughts and ideals no matter what the situation is, sees no reason in pretending to be something he isn't, and often has trouble adjusting his fun-loving character to act appropriately in serious circumstances. Although he is the captain of the Mugiwara Pirates, he is pretty much held in line by the rest of his crew, especially Nami. He does, however, usually get the final word. 
 
Luffy's aim is to become Pirate King and to claim the ultimate treasure that the old and greatest Pirate King, Gol D Roger, announced at his execution was at the end of the Grand Line: the most dangerous, treacherous and feared ocean in the world. This treasure, 'One Piece', gives the series its name. It is yet unknown exactly what One Piece is, or what it does. However, with every island of the Grand Line that the crew traverse (the only way to sail the Grand Line being to hop from one island to the next) they are one stop closer to finding Gol D Roger's heritage. 
 
The rest of the Mugiwara Crew consists of characters just as well-rounded, though still retaining their individuality. Roronoa Zoro, a green-haired 3-sword-wielding (one in each hand, one in his mouth) bounty hunter who has come to be known as 'Pirate Hunter Zoro' (though the name was neither coined nor furthered by the man himself) joins the crew in order to realise his childhood dream of becoming the best swordsman in the world, figuring the Grand Line should bring him a plethora of worthy opponents. 
 
Nami, the navigator, is a beautiful yet intelligent orange-haired girl whose dream is to draw a map of the whole world - though her main passion is accumulating vast sums of money, usually via theft. She is generally the brains of the crew, but occasionally needs Luffy to show her that her heart is in the right place. 
 
Usopp, a long-nosed man whose penchant for stretching the truth is made evident in pretty much every episode, wishes to follow in his father's footsteps and become a great pirate. Although he's not as strong as other members of the crew and has no specific 'special powers', his quick-thinking and ingenious-yet-comedic inventions have too often been known to save the day. 
 
Sanji, self-professed 'Love Cook', is a talented chef from the floating restaurant Baratie, who can cook as well as he can kick - Sanji is generally characterised by his inability to resist stepping in to rescue a beautiful lady, especially Nami (even though she manipulates him simply because she knows she can). Sanji joined the crew after great persuasion in order to find All Blue, the legendary ocean where the four seas meet, and thus fish from all the seas can be found - a gourmet cook's paradise. 
 
Tony Tony Chopper is the ship's doctor. Here's where it starts getting a little, well, let's say idiosyncratic. Chopper is a reindeer (not a tanuki, a reindeer!) who ate the 'Hito Hito' Devil's Fruit (hito means 'man'), meaning that he is not only able to talk (to both humans and animals - a skill that comes in very useful), but also walk on his hind legs, and even transform himself from cute to somewhat monstrous forms. Chopper wants to become a great doctor and help people, and eventually, after much persuasion from Luffy, sees piracy as a way to give his wish meaning and direction. An ongoing joke with Chopper is for him to shout &quot;Doctor! We need a doctor!&quot; whenever anybody gets injured, before realising that he's the ship's doctor, and so gets to work. Chopper is a cutesy/comedy character but also gives us plenty of reasons to take him seriously. 
 
Finally we have Nico Robin, a woman with a mysterious past, and another with the power of a Devil's Fruit. Robin ate the 'Hana Hana' fruit (hana = 'flower'), and thus is able to grow hands from any surface - an ability which sounds pointless on paper but has saved the Mugiwaras from so much danger over the episodes that it has become almost integral to their survival. Robin is an archaeologist who joined the Mugiwaras at her own behest, as Luffy had saved her life against her will. She spends most of her time reading history books, and someday dreams of finding the 'one true history' of their world by traversing the Grand Line in search of 'lodestones', which have ancient documents inscribed on them. 
 
Even at the early stage of introducing Luffy and watching him recruit the first few crewmates, I had fallen in love with this anime series. The first 20 or so episodes are somewhat slow-paced, as well as a little confusing, as the quirky sense of humour that One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda gives the series takes a little getting used to for a gaijin. The other members of the crew don't want to join Luffy's outfit immediately, but Luffy manages to convince them that becoming a pirate with him is the best way to realise their dreams, and also helps them to tie up loose ends in their homeland before setting off under the straw hat-wearing Jolly Roger. 
 
It's important to bear in mind that these are not your classic Western, rum-toting, eye patch-wearing, &quot;YAAAAAARRRRR&quot;-shouting pirates, with huge beards, peg legs and hooks for hands. That isn't to say there aren't characters who fall under these categories (except for the &quot;YAAAAARRRR&quot;ing), but One Piece is a world filled with intensely interesting, larger-than-life characters who bring a dimension to the anime you wouldn't have thought possible. The powers of the various enemies of the Mugiwara crew bring an almost rock-paper-scissors element to the show, as the party is often split up into groups who have to survive and meet back up with the others in order to continue their journey, some characters' expertises being more useful against certain enemies than others - although the rubberman never knows when to accept defeat! 
 
This anime contains some of the most imaginative and out-of-this-world story arcs I've ever come across in an anime series, especially one that does not take itself too seriously. One arc sees the Mugiwaras sail up into the sky to 'Skypeia', or Sky Island, where they take on an evil God who has the power of lightning. The final 'showdown' battles can span 10 or more episodes and are, for want of a better word, epic. Simply the journey undertaken to get onto the Grand Line itself is a tale worth rewatching for its many highlights, as well as being an introduction that comforts you by subtly indicating that the future escapades of the Mugiwara crew will pique your interests further. 
 
The Mugiwaras are to a point misunderstood as pirates - they don't plunder, rape or murder everybody they meet. In most cases, they actually help those they come across, but are still very much wanted by the Marines (the main governing body of the sea), who set huge bounties for Luffy and Zoro in order to garner help from bounty hunters, as well as the many other pirate factions sailing around. 
 
The animation sometimes lets the show down slightly - it seems the budget for the animators seems to rise and fall depending on the importance of the arc. Some battles are brilliantly animated, such as the showdown between Luffy and Crocodile, leader of the Shichibukai, but many of the filler arcs look poor in comparison. However, this does not take anything away from the fact that One Piece is a masterpiece, with a quirky Japanese sense of humour and a narrative that can be appreciated by all, but loved only by some. My advice is to give it a try - if you're anything like me it will certainly captivate your interest, and then some. 
 
Quick warning: stay WELL away from the 4KIDS English dub. They gutted the show, stripping it of many of its best features, and hired a voice cast that could test the sanity of anybody, be you 3 or 43. The lush orchestral musical score and lively J-pop intro has been replaced by awful faux hip-hop in order to market it to Americans, some of the blood is cut while some remains (this is NOT a gory anime by any stretch of the imagination - blood is used as more of an indicator that a fight has been going on a while), characters are renamed according to whim (Zoro is renamed Zolo, either to escape copyright infringement, give a closer transliteration from katakana, or just as an effort to be utterly, utterly lame), and there are some frankly ridiculous amendments - the one that really sticks out for me is Sanji's cigarette. Sanji likes to smoke, and he always has a cigarette hanging from the side of his mouth. In the 4KIDS dub, this cigarette is replaced - in every frame - with a lollipop.

    One Piece has been running for 15 years now and shows zero signs of slowing down. It is true that there are several anime and manga series that have run for MUCH longer, but that doesn't honestly excuse One Piece for how long it has overstayed it's welcome! One Piece has a diehard fandom and it is by far the highest in average rating out of the big 4 shonens. However, it is actually my LEAST favorite of the big 4. I'm dead serious, I really don't like One Piece and I will explain why. 
 
One Piece reminds me of a line from one of my favorite movies: Shaun of the Dead. Shaun: ""I like having him around, I've known him since primary school, and besides he's a laugh! Pete: ""Ok, I admit on rare occasion he can be funny. Remember when he was up all night drunk playing Tekken 2?"" Shaun: ""Oh yeah (laughs) when was that?"" Pete: ""That was 10 years ago! When the FUCK is he going home!?"" 
 
While other shonen series at least try to mature along with their fanbase like Naruto going to Naruto Shipuuden or Dragonball going to DBZ, One Piece is the same goofy, juvenile crap that it was in 1999, right down to the eye raping HORRIBLE art. Another problem is that it tells a continuous story, which makes it difficult for new fans to get into it or get caught up without spending 5 straight months doing nothing but watching One Piece! Pokemon has an excuse for running forever and never evolving (get it?) because new games come out and each season Ash must move to a new region and catch more Pokemon. Most people don't continue to watch Pokemon, so it is constantly getting new fans that are experiencing Pokemon for the first time. Pokemon (insert edition here) is their first Pokemon game and the anime seems fresh and new to them. They haven't seen the original Pokemon series or played the original games and it doesn't matter! Detective Conan has been running for 20 years, but like the Sherlock Holmes short stories it took inspiration from, it is completely episodic with a new mystery each week and only a few established characters. A new audience can jump in anytime and it doesn't matter if you've seen the first 15 seasons. One Piece actually tries to tell a continuous story where it DOES matter what happened in the first 10 seasons. You can't just jump in at episode 600 and expect to really enjoy it and understand it. However, even you get all caught up with the 800 episodes of the Straw Hat Crew, it isn't worth it because the tone, characters, and quality of story telling never matures into anything that someone 16 and up and having half a brain would find amusing! 
 
All of this isn't to say that One Piece is a particularly bad anime. I have seen some REALLY bad anime, but One Piece isn't on my list of anime I actually hate. One Piece is an anime that I consider mediocre, insanely overrated, and having run WAY past its time without having the grace or decency to take a bow. It is much like the Simpsons in that last regard. At least one good thing came out of One Piece....None Piece! If you haven't seen One Piece yet, I would recommend skipping this one, but still check out None Piece on Youtube, because it's awesome!

    Lets start with the story.  
 
Story. 2/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. 
 
Art. 3/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. 
 
Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. 
 
Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. 
 
Enjoyment. 5/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... 
 
overall this series is mostly full of gag you should not take it seriously if you do you're only going to be disappointed so the series isn't the worst series I've ever watch. So if you want a series to laugh at, I would 100% recommend one piece to you all.

    Well my first review, Ill try and make it a good one.  
 
One Piece, well i gotta be honest, I didn't like it at first. I thought that the voices were stupid and that it had really no plot whatsoever. This is all thanks to 4kids making the crappiest dub ever. I stopped watching it after, ep 20 or so, but then i heard to try it again using subs. I thought nah, it might sounds really stupid, but i still tried. After episode 20 or so, I was like &quot;WOW&quot;, this is awesome and from then on i was watching it non stop until episode 280 where i caught up. (yea i watched about 250+ episodes non stop) :D If you plan on watching it, watch it subbed please.  Well that's enough of that. Onwards. 
 
Story 
The story is really amazing.  At first i didn't find anything entertaining, but I pressed on and continued watching. The plot is really amazing.  Its different from what most mangaka does, and that is power.  The story is all about achieving your dreams, getting nakama(companions/friends), and overall having a grand adventure. The story is original in a sense that it gives you a feeling of ease and hilarity when reading it. I for one, have always enjoyed a chapter and in each chapter is very powerful and/or funny.  
 
Art 
Well to be honest, I find the art interesting.  I mean its cool at times but then in some episodes its really crappy.  Thats probably the only thing I dont like.  But the fight scenes are amazing. The character design is very interesting and very original. The animation is pretty...crappy at times but that's to be expected in some animes. I mean not all of them would be amazing but there are quite a few that really have good animation. The animation for most fight scenes are really well drawn and intricate. 
 
Sound 
I have only one thought for this. JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS OWN AMERICAN VOICE ACTORS. Seriously, they sound so much better and once you hear them, your instantly hooked to them.  4kids really did the crappiest dubbing ever, and that was mainly why i stopped watching it. Also their gum gum rap( american opening) was so terrible. Thanks to Funimation for at least making an &quot;ok&quot; dub. But subs are still the best. Their voices mesh with the characters personality so much that it's amazing. 
 
Character 
Wow. The characters are really amazing. From the air-head captain to the greedy, money-loving navigator, it really is the most unique anime ever.  They are all different characters with all different dreams that power them throughout the show.  They all have alot in common, but really the biggest thing they have in common is that they all believe and support their captain, because he has saved them where they needed it the most.  Every character in One Piece is different from everyone and they are all entertaining. Every episode is funny and most of the time it is Luffy that makes it funny. Luffy is pretty much the most unique character made.  He is a simple minded captain who has no other thought other than one piece, his nakama, and MEAT. Yes meat, he loves meat,  but if you watch it you will learn that :p 
 
Enjoyment 
Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The fillers are much better than Naruto or Bleach fillers and they are alot more exciting.  Again the fight scences are amazing.  Every episode you will definitely laugh, because Oda-sensei (the mangaka- the one who made One Piece) is awesome.  He is pretty much the most creative mangaka, and the person i definitely want to meet.   
 
Overall 
Overall, I give One Piece a 10/10, well because it is pretty much amazing. The characters are very loveable, especially Luffy.  Every episode i laughed, every episode I was always at the edge of my seat.  If people tell you that One Piece sucks or that its not all that great, then don't listen! The only bad thing about One Piece is that 4kids made the dub first and then ruined it in America, don't listen and just watch it.  Listen to me and not them okay :D

    Review In short,  
I'm Going to keep it real with you all that you would obviously see my score that i gave One Piece.  
Well, That is why in my review I'm going to go over these factors as to why this isn't worth your time so that I can save you a life line. So for that You are welcome. (This Applies To Manga Also in case your wandering) 
 
Anyway I have Dropped this series for many reasons alone that I did to where I was watching and Investing my time with this and its pretty simple why that is and why It made sense for me to review One Piece.  
 
Firstly Its very easy to base this series on the analogy of this being a shonen adventure series yes, however what continues to irk at my own viewing experience of watching this for a long while now and to put it simply if I were to sum up this series in a nutshell It would be summed up in 4 words...(Typical Forced Annoying Tendencies)   
 
To empathize my point much further,  
This anime has dragged onto the point where I know longer care where the story is heading now because its writer  
Oda Eiichiro unfortunately likes to Time waste WAY too often in his  
writing of milking hundreds of episodes of this series of its so called world building and brain wash a lot of its Japanese audience as well as those that following the whole over saturated popular shonen trend in the process to the point that the fans themselves have overate this anime in general in its own category. 
 
Literally the story has not changed to any degree where a new plot can be implemented differently in its approach which sadly isn't the case let alone can the story mature with its premise as this is still following the same freaking formula of a repetitive lame shonen nonsense of its character troupes with most of its episodes from 1 to god knows what episode its currently on right now so far which I really question if this anime just wants the viewers attention just because of its length that can still be milked because of it?  
 
OR does it want to be a pirate adventure shonen that can integrate an effort into its story and characterizations? Well at this point I can easily tell you that both completely Suck at making these traits realized in Oda's craft which is not engaging my viewing of the same formula with many random added coincidences that luffy and strawhats encounter on their journey and with that has lost more credibility in claiming that this is an anime about pirates in general which is even more ridiculous throughout and for the longest time after a while I just found this series to be rather boring and predictable in its long tedious dragged out boring narrative.  
(Btw, Nothing to do with just its length or its terrible look in general) 
 
I honestly got to ask those currently watching or even reading One piece  
Do you really like to enjoy the same old tropes and jokes over and over again that includes many long pointless plot elements that have many cons for milking their story and character for its own purpose?? 
 
Its Just like how the Naruto franchise lost credibility thinking its own series depicts ninjas in its own way to show the struggle taking place for nonjas old and young in its own viewing in the show which shows in both naruto and one piece over time what it has lost through its extended transition in both their writing of these concepts. 
 
As a shonen anime Its these glaring flaws that just keeps continuing on and on. That in terms of its story, characterization, progression, writing, enjoyment and any replay value what so ever for a shonen experience which becomes blatantly obvious that it fails! especially when some claim this to be the definitive shonen anime experience of a grand adventure. (Oh Dear.) 
 
There are 2 clear things fans will use to defend this show by saying don't be put off by the shows length or its dumb cartoony animation and secondly dont be put off with the handling of the material in the way Toei Animation handles this so instead read the manga, And to that I say.. NONSENSE! Since the show already has a lot problems already that fans seem to gloss over. 
 
You see, Reading its Guinness book of its trash manga doesn't even help or even give me value for reading through for what has loads of the same problems as I've mentioned above. 
 
If that wasn't enough of an issue. Its story of its characters and its events always end up feeling pretty much the same Forced Melodramatic story in its writing that you have seen and heard loads of times and only forces you to endure this along with bad side stories that contribute into an even SLOWER pace for this show in each of its build up with each Arc that by over hundreds and hundreds of episodes later by then it totally becomes unacceptable, By then I don't blame certain people out there for skipping chunks of its story now and then.  
(Trust me, Having tolerance for this anime should be the least of your worries here people.) 
 
For me going through each arc to arc in a easy going manner that I approach most anime through my viewing You'd expect that this would be casual thing of ease for me right? No sweat? WRONG,  
It didn't guarantee me as a viewer any love or charm what so ever to a lot of its characters like the time you are first introduce to them in the series. 
 
Instead it only just copies and paste stuff mostly of the same scenarios that you would see far too often in this series for most if not all of these characters and YES that does includes the main crew along with their progression except for some few in the straw hat crew that show to get more abilities than others really makes it fair in its togetherness doesn't it?  
(Some bonding that is if you ask me?, since only a few certain characters with plot armour that can do certain things most others couldn't do)  
 
Even when uniting the straw hats together only just makes it for a more cheesier affair most of the time when you would obviously expect it Especially when it comes off as cliche as it does.  
 
Which also regards to parts where one piece at some parts wants to go dark its already so desperate to up the ante that a blind Ray Charles can easily tell from miles away that its only going to result into a similar conclusion like before. 
 
I mean come on! its way past most of the amount of standard shonen episodes! which reminds me of Detective Conan, However in Conan's case the Difference is between these 2 series is in its Fandoms.  
One Piece fans try to Over hype the crap out of this which is really unnecessary even when lots of people know clearly that it is the case.  
 
A terrible excuse for making points along this series own progression just because its stretched out as it has been for the premise inexcusably which is a joke for those who try to justify this notion.  
 
Look, We already got the basic gist of things going on in this series from the beginning, Even through its dumb world building and set up and even till now is still not even well structured since it throws random places for us to be distracted so that fillers can help maintain its bad pace let alone does it even make that much sense to begin with especially when trying to use foreshadowing to justify the ridiculous amount of episodes that is in this series as it is to make us feel like we have feel invested in the unknown mysteries of the show which actually does the opposite effect.  
 
I believe the one piece fandom have gotten mixed up with what world building actually is with the amount of episodes there have been especially focusing on stuff that this show thinks I should see but I don't and no I don't need to have to skip arcs just to enjoy something, Why should I? that is just retarded. Is that why its Manga counterpart is in the Guinness book of records because of its pacing and complacency? Makes sense for whatever parts of this series gains popularity in much of its story for being pointlessly repetitive i suppose. 
 
1. First off regarding what I've mentioned so far,  
If you have an immersive world and there is already enough content in the story/journey in your world building never mind how vast or mysterious it is, Don't pointlessly drag it out instead USE IT! and stop milking it with stupid character expressions of coincidences full of plot devices and plot armour, I do not care that it is a dumb shonen. At least FMA knew this a lot better. 
 
2. Pointless prologues to your episodes.  
 
3. Bad morals in many different situations of the story with its writing. 
 
4. Stupid journey objectives that hardly revolves around the plot of the treasure of one piece until HUNDREDS AND I MEAN HUNDREDS of episodes later on to the point which is unacceptable along with milking its main characters most of the time of this franchise that gets to the point where it feels like its turning into filler which by the way there are a lot of them no matter what fans try to say against this. 
 
5. Dumb fanservice depictions of its females making video games like dead or alive and Onechanbara look a lot more tolerable. 
 
6. Stop foreshadowing something in the story that was mentioned hundreds and hundreds of episodes ago as its not good story telling neither is it clever in any way since it never justifies its consistency for constantly dragging on in the way it does. 
 
7. Over hyping stronger characters that don't really get involve in the story that much anyway. 
 
8. Its lame music score that should sound great but it doesn't. 
 
9. Most of the times bad animation no doubt, AKA Toei Animation VERY LAZY INDEED and are swimming in pools of Yen around them like fat sewer Rats.  
 
10. Devil fruits abilities in the way with any other devil fruits that are demonstrated looks stupid and nonsensical to the overall balance and power scaling with variations of different class devil fruit users, which in term of supposedly creating unpredictability and uniqueness to a devil fruit user's abilities only serves to unfortunately create a convoluted mess of an explanation of devil fruit powers in general to those that are Logia, Paramecia and Zoan in their own element even in terms of their weakness which is badly depicted on in the show. 
 
11. Haki creates a lot of bullcrap deus ex machinas later on as an excuse of not explaining a lot about devil fruits all that well and lots of times is used mainly for plot armour for certain characters of the writer's choice which is lazy nor does it add anything new to the battle scaling in fights more like unneeded add ons. 
 
12. its voice acting well its just mostly tedious and over the place nothing great or over the top despite how Oda writes the story (Bad writing Btw) that even after listening to lot of these characters it just makes me want to listen to a dying mule instead. Nothing weird or wonderful about that my friends. 
 
With all that being said, Its only qualities that I like about one piece are the art designs of certain characters and the fact there is a series that stars pirates, since there are very few anime series that have pirates (not that they are suppose to be role models in any way)  
but those are the only positives with this series in general for me and honestly nothing more. 
 
Overall its an over exaggerated series of repetitive outcomes that I have not enjoyed in its long run about dumb wannabe pirates quote PIRATES! It's only real positive here is HEY ITS ABOUT PIRATES WOW THATS RARE TO FIND IN ANIME ISN'T IT???..WRONG BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT PIRATES ARE LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHO CARES ANYWAYS.  
 
That is like me wanting to write a story about slavery on different Ethnicity/Races but NOOOOOOO............. that won't be right, so why not glorify slave traders into being these nice dumb heroes? because you know It sounds interesting right? RIGHT??... WELL WRONG AGAIN. 
 
Now going back to my point of Watching this crappy cartoon this only makes me or most viewers seem to have to glorify such a pathetic outlook of a premise with its stretched out world building that is not even incisive enough to its history of the story, neither is it memorable for me enough to even care about it to watch it any longer as it doesn't reward me growth in their characters, a decisive objective or consistency of its so called journey within its story in general.  
 
Last but not least The fights really suck! seriously do yourselves a Big favour there are better Shonens and many other Animes out there that is worth watching that has better characters, better story, better pacing and better growth than this long turd of a show that seems to overate a lot in Japan above others which unfortunately is the world we live in today. Consider this dropped and good riddance.  
 
Excuse me for being honestly critical as I am as I do not sugar coat a series if that is what you really wanted about this show in general, well too bad. You can go to other reviewers that are giving out tens towards this Overrated piece of fiction that's overstayed it's welcome. 
 
To all of you who have read my review thanks for taking the time and take care.

    In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review's goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series. 
 
And by the way, this review is based upon the original Japanese version. If you have had the bad luck of viewing the 4Kids dubbed version, you have my heartfelt condolences. Right, well, anyway, moving on... 
 
PLOT: The story of One Piece mostly consists of the Straw Hat Pirates traveling from island to island and having crazy adventures. Although each crewmember has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: to reach the end of the treacherous Grand Line. Bound by this promise, they pass through unbelievable adventures. Given this pattern, you would think the plot would get boring and predictable, right? Amazingly enough, unlike shonen anime with similar plot devices, One Piece manages to become less and less predictable as its plot advances. As it advances, it also delves into serious situations. There is actually much tragedy involved with One Piece, but the show maintains a balance of comic relief as well. I've actually been driven to tears many times while watching this show, but I've laughed out loud just as many times, if not more. 
 
ART: One Piece's art style is one of the elements that turns many people off to the series. The style is fairly old-school, remniscent of 90's shows like Dragonball Z. Then again, I guess One Piece started out in the late 90's, too, so that's to be expected. Either way, the quality of the animation steadily improves as the show moves along. The show is now broadcast in HD, and the quality simply blows me away with every new episode. But the show's animation style remains the same, just greatly improved in terms of quality. After all, with a show as crazy as One Piece, modern animation styles just wouldn't fit. I simply cannot imagine Monkey D. Luffy with eyes like Uzumaki Naruto; it simply does not work. 
 
SOUND: I absolutely adore the music of One Piece. There are so many different kinds of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, angry, confused, funny, sleepy, scared, epic, cryptic, foreboding, intense, etcetera, etcetera. For each of these situations, there is a unique musical piece which plays in the background. What's more is that each character has their own style of music and their own theme. Whenever I hear a background song, I immediately know what's going on, and fall into the according state of mind. It happens subconsciously, and it adds to both the predictability and spontaneity of the show. If Zoro's 'epic' music begins to play, he may still lose his current battle. However, whenever I hear that music, I immediately know, ""Zoro is going to dominate in this scene,"" regardless of whether or not he actually does. 
 
CHARACTERS: I cannot think of enough synonyms for ""incredible"" to sufficiently describe One Piece's character development, so I'll just say that it's definitely SUPER!!! Ahahaha...yeah, that was a reference to the show...anyway, the characters of One Piece are one of its major selling points. In fact, it was the characters, not the story, that hooked me to this show. Each character has their own personal reason for sailing the Grand Line and for joining the Straw Hat Pirates, and this goal pushes them to new heights with each passing adventure. This goal is backed by an emotionally engrossing backstory which usually can encompass more than two episodes. I have been moved to tears by so many touching flashbacks I no longer possess enough fingers to count them all. The characters are all very personable as well, and are the one aspect of One Piece you can nearly always predict. You always know Luffy will be Luffy, and Usopp will be Usopp. Never would you expect Sanji to suddenly lash out at Nami, but you would certainly expect Nami to lash out at everyone else. Do not misunderstand me; I am not implying that the characters of One Piece are static. They are all decidedly not static. By comparing the current Luffy with the Luffy of the first few episodes, you can discern an obvious difference. The same holds true for all of the crewmembers. Yet the changes take place gradually over time, not all at once. That is my favorite part of this anime. Just like actual humans, the One Piece characters develop new traits and discard old traits, but always remain the same person they were when first introduced. 
 
ENJOYMENT: When trying to convince my friends that they should watch One Piece (mostly so I can discuss the latest episodes with them), I inevitably have to ask myself why I personally enjoy the series. And then I am stumped. I mean, I could say all the above and people still wouldn't be satisfied. There would be people asking, ""Well, why do you like that kind of plot? I saw this one show that had a different kind and I liked it."" How am I supposed to respond to that!? That's the equivalent of saying, ""Why do you like chocolate ice cream? I like vanilla, and it's way better."" Whether you enjoy something or not all depends on how your brain is wired and your attitude when you try it. Just because I love One Piece doesn't mean you will, and just because someone hates One Piece doesn't mean I have to. Erm...I kind of got on a rant. Ehehehe...uh, yeah. So, I enjoy One Piece because of the above reasons. Is...that all I'm supposed to put here? It seems inadequate for some reason... 
 
OVERALL: In conclusion, I find One Piece to be epic! Whether you do or don't, please don't discount it for any reason until you've actually begun watching it. While I can attest to the fact that the story doesn't really become exciting until the crew reaches the Grand Line, the material before that is still crucial to the rest of the story, and is still very enjoyable. Oh, and as a matter of precaution, DO NOT WATCH THE 4KIDS DUB! If you do, then you may very well suffer severe damage to your cerebral cortex. If you must watch the show in English, I recommend the FUNimation dub. Their DVDs contain about 13 episodes each, and are available wherever you buy your anime. I forget how much they cost...well, you can Google it if you really want to.

Well I'm about to do what most people consider suicide... Talk bad about One Piece... 
 
Following: Full-fledged review and chibi review-version at the end for those who can't read: 
 
FULL REVIEW: 
 
To be clear about this: I have seen all movies and all the episodes released until now (ep 658) and while there are tons of things I'd like to talk about, one thing stands above all: One Piece never grew up like other shounen did. Naruto, Bleach, Dragonball and even Fairy Tail have become more mature and improved themselves over the passage of time. One Piece is still the same non-serious, immature nonsense that first aired in 1999. 
 
Well to begin with One Piece's famous strongest point, the story... I am just not impressed. Ignoring the fact that after 600 episodes the anime's new arc revolves around talking toys and chibi fairies (childish as hell), most of One Piece's arcs are practically the same. Straw Hats arrive at said island, where a tragedy has been happening despite the place appearing bright on the outside, the whole tragedy originates from 1 man who is usually evil for the most pitiful of reasons, straw hats get seperated into 3-4 groups, straw hats kick villain ass, a big feast is thrown in by the glad citizens where another arc is foreshadowed before they move on to the next island. And while people will argue that the ""War of the Best""arc was different, I still didn't find it the least bit interesting (2 deaths only? really?). 
 
Staying on the story part, lets talk about what's arguably the most important story element in a shounen: The villain. One Piece has yet to show us a villain whose appearance isn't laughable. Crocodile was wearing a coat in the middle of the dessert, Enel's ears were too long not to notice, blackbeard is missing way too many teeth to be taken seriously, Donflamingo... I can't even begin to name the things that make him not-even-slightly threatening. In general One Piece follows the brilliant rule that ""evil is stupid"" and the protagonist's charge-ahead thoughtless moves always prevail against the plans the villains had been setting for a few good decades now. Going for villains' backstories, it's usually brilliant writing such as: Stupid for the Yolo, big misunderstanding in the past, pity jealousy and ""we will explain it some time in the future"". Sorry, its just hard to take these guys seriously. 
 
Still on the story part: Being so kid-friendly is annoying. I can't get over how War of the Best, the ""grand battle"" of One Piece only had 2 victims, or how the Colosseum in the Dressrosa arc had no casualties whatsoever in a ""battle to the death"". Oda grow some balls and KILL people. Also regarding Ace's death in the War of the Best... I am not amused by how all of One Piece fans claim it as the most tragic thing to ever happen and yet we knew nothing about Ace other than the flashbacks. You could just as easily have put a Nazi Officer in his place and I'm sure the fanbase would still be crying buckets if we saw a flashback of said officer playing with the snow as a child while some uninspired dramatic music was playing. I can't decide if I'm more annoyed by the awful writing or how moronic the fanbase is. 
 
Humor & Fanservice: Waaaaaay too repetitive. It was funny in the first 100 episodes, now I just want to chocke puppies every time Brook makes a skeleton joke or Luffy and Chopper get overly excited about something. On the fanservice + story part: There is no female lead. Nami and Robin became important characters for their respective arcs (Arlong + CP9) but right after that they slipped in the background and became minor characters. Still on the Fanservice part: Oh yeah, sex, flirting and even love don't exist in this universe. Everyone trying to take part in one of those is either a villain-in-disguise or someone about to be tricked because of their stupidity. In general: For One Piece Sex/flirt/love is stupid (right next to ""evil is stupid""). 
 
Sound Part: 1st: The variety is a total disappointment. I can't remember a single track that actually got me on the edge of my sit. 2nd: The animators don't even make proper use of the soundtracks that already are avaliable to them. For example remember the final fight Luffy had against Crocodile. Do you remember the epic music? Obviously no because some moron decided that the fight shouldn't have music at all. Now imagine if at the same scene (final moments before Crocodile's defeat) One Piece's original opening ""we are"" was added. Suddenly the scene becomes 100% more exciting. They already had the copyrights, it's not like adding it would hurt anyone! The sound effects are equally terrible. Just look at the brilliant sound effect of Sanji repeatedly kicking Don Flamingo in ep 655... Sorry but I have made RPG Maker games with better sound effects than this. On the voice acting part: MOTHER OF ALL ATTROCITIES, IT'S HORRIBLE. Just look at the age of the voice actors, half of them are about to die (and I'm crossing my fingers). The voices are completely unfitting for most of the cast, not sounding at all like the age they're supposed to portray (well that's a big surprise...). Of course screams of despair, crying etc etc don't sound even relatively convincing. 
 
Animation: Just awful. Way below the antagonism. The only worse animation example I can provide in a relatively similar episode release period was the ""fast-paced-action"" in the Naruto Vs Pain battle, and that was an artistic mistake on the studio's part that was never again repeated for exactly that reason. I won't even go into detail describing how lazy the studio is, using the same footage OVER AND OVER AND OVER. 
 
Action: Doesn't really exist. One Piece doesn't ever show a proper fight without something goofy (aka annoying morons making even more annoying jokes) breaking up the seriousness. When the anime does decide to get serious it's just Luffy screaming on top of his lungs cliche lines while the villain doesn't even bother debating and just tries to kill Luffy (not that I blame them). The fights mostly consist of 10 seconds of action being repeatedly shown with slightly different soundtracks playing on the background each time and villain lengthy monologues inbetween them, usually followed by concentration-breaking flashbacks of things we have already seen a million times. If you're hoping for creative fast-paced excitement look elsewhere. 
 
One Piece is like a kid that never grew up. After 600 episodes, despite all the ""hardshps"" our protagonist came through, he never really matured, none of the characters did. The tone of the anime didn't mature either. a graphics improvement and a gradual increase of the cast members being the only notable changes since the beginning of the anime and for me it has just become too monotonous, too boring. Once Piece is waaay past its due, but there is a single reason it stays alive. Nostalgia. People are willing to overlook all of its flows simply because it serves as a bridge for times when things were simpler for them (or so they remember at least). But if someone was to judge One Piece for what it really is and not for the happy memories of being taken by daddy to the Luna Park he would see it for what it is: Trash. 
 
CHIBI REVIEW VERSION: 
Aweful animation and soundtrack, followed a story that quite clearly follows a pattern even for its jokes, overly repetitive and with action that doesn't really remind of action. Immature, with annoying characters that are portrayed as ""smart"" rather than ""morons"" and laughable villains. Stay away.

    Warning: Minor Spoilers 
  
If I were to say anything bad (and I will have to do that as this review is not a positive one) about this anime that would not offend the hardcore fans (and I know there are a lot) is that it's PAINFULLY slow. 
 
 Even if you leave the fillers aside, still- the plot itself progresses in such a slow pace that it's rather hard to watch. Now for a younger audience it may not matter that much, but to me as a higher age audience, it matters greatly, after all, out of the 23~ minutes of each episode 3 are spent on opening and ending (which is usual I guess), but in most episodes, roughly 5 (!) or more minutes are spent on a recap of the current story arc, as if the creators of the show forgot it's a shounen anime and instead got the idea that the audience are elderly people with Alzheimer. 
 
 But ok, this means there is still 15 minutes left per episode right? Well, not really. In most episodes, the heroes get separated. When they do, the anime tries to keep track of ALL of them simultaneously, cutting every few minutes. This wouldn't be so bad IF after the cut, the same exact scene did not repeat itself (example - a few seconds that show one of the main heroes standing and looking at a place/ villain that is shown from a few angles. Then the anime continues elsewhere, and when it comes back to the same place, the same exact scene is shown). That may not sound as much, but in drastic cases that can sum up to a few minutes (the worst case I bothered to count was almost 4 minutes of time wasted on watching the same scene). Combined with a lot of other tricks, I'd say that a lot of episodes are left with about 11 minutes of actual content on average. That is simply dreadful. 
 
 Now to say some positive things for contrast- the story is actually very interesting and the characters are well done... BUT, no matter how good something is, if you drag it out too much (and this is indeed the case with One Piece), even the best story in the world and the best characters possible (not to say one piece has neither of those.. The story is great, and the characters are good, but not more) will not keep you entertained, and turn even the best story possible into a boring experience.  
 
Now back to the negatives. NO ONE DIES IN THIS ANIME. This is of course an exaggeration, as some people actually do die in this anime BUT only when it's critical to the plot. At all the other times, the characters ""die"" just to add drama and to come back a few scenes later.. Sometimes to ""die"" again and add even more ""drama"" (added """" because at this point its more awkward/silly after one time rather than dramatic). The worst case of this I saw was with Brownbeard who ""died"" something like 5 times over 2-3 episodes (if I remember right), and still stayed alive in the end while the show tried to suck as much drama out of this as possible. And this brings me to the next point- fake drama. They seem to try and squeeze out as much of it as possible, at every opportunity they get. From crying children (and adults) to characters repeatedly ""dying"" and to the most cliche tearjerkers possible at every turn of the story. They even go as far as to try and make the villain's henchmen AND EVEN THE VILLAIN himself have a tragic past that you are supposed to relate to and feel sorry for (because seems a villain can't just be evil because that is just the way he is, he had to become evil because something bad happened (lol)). Also I mentioned crying.. There is an unbelievable amount of it in this anime. And that would be ok (I guess) if  
A- they did not try to milk it for drama (yep, that's a word that sure gets a lot of use when discussing this anime huh?) every single time 
B- they didn't think that when someone cries, he instantly turns ugly, with snot running down his nose and with the worst face expression possible, regardless of gender,  age or how emotional he is. 
 
I'd say a lot more, but there is already a lot of text, and it's enough to sum it up - this anime is not one I would recommend someone to watch under any normal circumstances (maybe only if someone made a shortened version with all the repeats, openings, endings and cuts removed thus making the whole anime be at around 300 episodes max), I watched over 600 episodes myself, and I can safely say that although some parts were enjoyable, it was mostly rather boring when looked as a whole, and I am regretting the time I spent watching it (as of what i watched it so long- my friend recommended it to me and I did not expect it to last this long. I usually finish what I start, but this is ridiculous.)

    One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched. 
But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we? 
 
A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age.  
 
In the world of One Piece, there is such a thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water. 
 
And where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
Now how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple. 
 
One Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be.  
 
One Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together. 
 
Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable. 
 
In contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does. 
 
Another potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is. 
 
Do not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit. 
 
In short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen. 
 
Regardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.

    There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show.  ""I don't like the art style"" or ""I've seen the dub - NO THANKS.""  I'm guilty of both of these myself.  But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece.  For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is.  If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh.  They butchered it, there's really no other way to put it.  They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series.  FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go. 
 
As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen.  Much more ""cartoonish"" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime.  Despite that, you end up loving it.  I wouldn't even say that you have to ""get used to it"" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way.  It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before.  Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have.  Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at. 
 
Now that we've got those two points out of the way... 
 
One Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise.  The plot is pretty basic at first.  Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him.  You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them.  They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities.  They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams.  Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew.  Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason.  Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series.  No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses. 
 
The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE.  Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch.  The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC.  But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge.  The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few.  There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor. 
 
One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise!   There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things.  I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point.  One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments.  And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA. 
 
In a word, One Piece is perfect.  And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say?  It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end.  It is, simply put, amazing. 
 
So why should you watch One Piece? 
 
Because you're missing out on one hell of a fantastic show if you don't at least give it a try.

    To start off, I had seen quite a few episodes of one piece as a child on toonami, prior to even discovering what anime was in fact. From the very beginning I had adored this show, even watching the horrendous dubs on american television.  
 
To speak of the dubs, do not judge one piece by these. PLEASE. For God's sake don't hate one piece or anything about it because of what 4kids decided to do to it. Simply put they took something of masterpiece and full of depth into a shallow, horrid voice acting, and choppy version of the original. Funimation has done quite a decent job of recreating the dubbed version, but nothing can compete with the original, as the original is what it was meant to be like.  
 
Also, do not dismiss this lovely anime because of the earlier animation style of the first few episodes (as well as the more cartoony based style.) To dismiss something because of the artwork is no good reason to not watch it. THe characters are so unique and so original, and each character has meaning. Oda (the author) goes into complete detail with each of his characters. Even creating the characters in all of the filler episodes.  
 
What I can say about the story is that I have never laughed harder, sobbed more intensely, or fangirled more viciously than in this anime. The pure plot of this anime is so in depth and so intricate that I have re watched it several times (yes, all 554 episodes) So many people I come in contact with ask me ""How in the WORLD do you watch something so long? I just can't start now it's too overwhelming."" Well, let me tell you. I got so into this I was watching about 20-30 episodes daily. Just from the fact that I couldn't get enough of this anime. I really couldn't. 
 
It's starts off as a regular kind of pirate scenario where everyone wants to become the best. What really caught me is the fact that it takes every type of pirate ""legend"" or mystery and puts it into a reality. Sea monsters, crazy powers, evil marines, everything. What also caught me is starting out with one boy and one dream, and making that dream seem more and more real by the battles and crew-mates he finds along his adventure.  
 
I guess I like the flavor of starting off small and crawling your way to strength and ambition, but this anime just packs that flavor into one huge ice cream sundae. With a friggen cherry on the very top. I really have only praise for this masterpiece. Unforgettable characters, amazing scenery, endless adventure.  
 
Simply put. I never want it to end.

    If you asked me about One Piece, i would tell you that it's one, if not the greatest shounen ever, with fun characters, great adventure, fights, feels and backstories. Once you specify that you're talking about the Anime? Oh boy. The adaptation is done by Toei animation. At first it wasn't terrible. The animation has always been kinda Meh but i can take that without that many issues. However, in the Skypiea Arc i've noticed a reused soundeffect from Dragon Ball (the fuck?) and i started to get a little salty about the adaptation. After the 2 year time skip it was getting worse and worse, animation, sound, pacing, comedy. All of it was getting worse by the minute. 
 
Now, at around episode 820 the issues are worse than ever.  
You see, the anime is catching up to the manga, but they don't want to stop cranking out the anime, nor do they want to go the Filler route. So instead they stretch it out as much as possible. So much so that about half of the ""content"" in the current anime epsodes, isn't in the manga.  
For example, the fights. In the manga they are emotional and hype. In the anime, you see them talk for 3 minutes, than it's gonna focus on someone else, than it gets back, a single punch is landed (that you see in stillshot for 2 minutes), than it cuts to other characters talking for 5 minutes......you get the point.  
Not only that the pacing gets fucked up like this. They often try to add comedic moments to make it more bearable. Except they fail. Hard.  
What you have now is such a chaotic and slow development of characters plot, butchered comedy and basically everything else that's been altered by toei is shit too.  
Stuff that takes a chapter in the manga, takes 3 episodes in the anime. Not only that, but at the start of each episode, there's a ""recap"" of the last episode, then opening, then stuff happens (but not really), then there is ending and preview for the next episode. Just like that, 24 minute episode has 12 minutes of the actual anime, which consists out of 8 minutes of exposition, 2 minutes of stillshots and 2 minutes of actual content. 
 
One piece is great, don't take me wrong. Hell at the start of the anime, it was pretty good, but as time went on, it kept getting worse and worse and now i consider it borderline unwatchable. 
  
TL;DR 
If you want to experience the Magical journey that is One Piece, read the manga. the anime is a little over 820 episodes ATM so catching up will take you a while, and once you do catch up, there's no hype or emotion, just ruin and a hollow shell of the manga  that's been beaten to death by toei.

    man, what can i say about this show....in america i 1st saw one piece on fox for kids, and i thought it was the worst shit i had ever seen in my life, because us sloppy americans like to make &quot;cartoons&quot; kid friendly so they took all the great things japan did with one piece out and made it really gay, not to mention the voice acting was TERRIBLE.....BUT I checked it out again in 2007 and found it bareable..........as the show moved on i just thought wow i love this show......luffy and the rest of the characters are great......i even like the characters that i wouldnt necissarily like if they were on another show ( ussop and nami) this epic is great, they do everything really well. when theres drama its great..when there comedy and funny as hell, the fighting is great, the Story is fantastic,i love everything about one piece. hence the reason why its my favorite show, idk when a show is going to knock it out of the number one spot, but when it comes along, ill be shocked.

    First things first; forget about the number of episodes. For this truly doesn't matter for once you start you won't want to stop. This show is an EPIC and is one of the best the adventure genre has to offer! 
 
I first saw an episode of One Piece years ago and thought that was pretty good and then didn't cross my mind until I started to get into anime more. What really put me off was the sheer number of episodes there was and thought that there must be a sh*t ton to fillers like Naruto. While Naruto in like 75% filler One Piece only has 58 filler episodes which I even enjoyed watching. Strangely I keep wanting more fillers now, strange right?  I asked my friend who reads the manga 'They must have found the One Piece by now, right?' he said 'Not yet' this got me interested. So I decided to pace myself and start watching it thinking i'll take this slow and pace myself. 3 weeks later... where are the rest of the episodes?!?!?! 
 
Story - 10 - They story is about Monkey D. Luffy's journey to become the King of the Pirates along with his crew mates who each have a harsh past and a dream of their own that they wish to fulfill on this journey along the Grand Line. They travel to new places making new friends and new enemies along the way. Now that may seem simple but one of the best things about One Piece is that it is an ever expanding universe where everything is intertwined and nothing is insignificant. 
 
Art - 9 - Now the art in One Piece may not be anything like the Fate series, but that doesn't matter. This is a show about pirates who starts from nothing and grows to be recognized world over. Just how the story and crew grow and develop, so does the art. The art starts out very simple (keep in mind that this started in 1999) and at first put me off a little since I was used to art like Fate and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo but it eventually grew on me and suddenly I didn't  care anymore and started to really like it. Now at episode 717 the art has become cleaner and more fluid, while I look back and think how well the art reflected the story in the early episodes (That being said there isn't anything wrong with the art now). 
 
Sound - 10 - ALL THE OPENINGS ARE GREAT (I am even playing them in the background while writing this review =) ) ! They dubbed the first few openings and I think they did them really well and prefer them over the subbed versions. They are all memorable and catchy. They make you want to watch them all the way though every time. Every soundtrack is great and reflects each scene splendidly. Very WELL DONE! 
 
Characters - 10 - Since I could go on forever about the characters, I will try and keep this short. If you want character development then this is one of the best. Each character develops a lot (Especially Nami =P)  While they travel together they form bonds with each other and we get to know what drives each character to do what they do. I don't want to spoil anymore since this is a big part of watching the show so i'll just say that you won't be disappointed with the character development since it does is done EXTREMELY WELL.  
 
Enjoyment - 10 - You should be able to tell from my review that this is one of my favourites. This show and all of the characters will always hold a place in my heart.  This is one journey that you don't want to miss. I watched One Piece dubbed from episode 1- 384, and would recommend it for everyone. The dub is good from that point onward but I watched it  in subbed because the dub wasn't out yet and I really enjoyed it.  
 
Don't be turned off by the number of episodes. Even if you only watch 2 episodes a week I would recommend starting it. The adventure is still going and will last another decade. Plenty of time to catch up! See you on the Grand Line my nakama!

How to Watch One Piece Without Filler - http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=453655 
Subbed or dubbed (Funimation)? - I think that the dub is more enjoyable for the first 384 episodes at least. I couldn't watch the subbed version of the early episodes. To me the Japanese voices are really annoying. The subbed version is better after episode 384. I would say it's slightly better than the dubbed version.

    ok, let me just start by saying that approx 25 episodes in (with my friends pushing and screaming at me to continue watching) i got caught up in the storm. Every arc begins calmly, and ends in shock/epic , and they always do it right. With this many episodes, theyve set a parallel universe in our minds, and all this is due to 50% Luffy and 50% everything else: 
 
because Luffy, although he looks simple, is just the ultimate favorite character i have ever seen in all the animes i can think of. 
 
and i have never seen a more powerful redefining of the word CONFIDENCE in all my life. if you havent seen it, what are you waiting for...

    This series is just awesome, that's all there is to say. 
There are a lot of unique items/attacks/characters in this series, and Luffy keeps the fun going! 
 
What I really wanted to write this review to say is: 
If you're going to watch it, which you should, watch the Kaizoku Fansubs. I really can't stand any of the other subs. They screw it up in so many ways. In one case, I don't even know how they got &quot;Gomu Gomu no Mushi&quot; mixed up with &quot;Gomu Gomu no Rocket&quot; it's just THAT bad. Kaizoku sub it the best, Staw Hats off to them. :P

    *Spoiler Free Review* 
One Piece is an Anime about Pirates, Mainly one crew of Pirates called ""Straw Hats"". It is a action adventure anime, where the characters have special powers and are super strong. 
 
The Main storyline isn't that amazing, It's typical boy has a dream, boy goes out to obtain said dream, but what is amazing is the side storys that mixes into the main story, and there are tons, most of these are character background or goals, but it all fits in very nice, due to how big the One Piece world is, and how well the characters are devolped. The main reason I gave Story a 7 is due to the real main story, it's been done tons of times. 
 
The artwork and animation in this Anime gets alot of negitave response, but on the whole i'd say its average, its not rubbish by any standard, and sometimes has some very nice effects, But it's not the best out there. Don't be put off by the people who list the animation as why one piece sucks, because its the most stupidest thing ever, people still play old video games and watch old anime, do people complain about the graphics/ animation in them? No.  
 
The Sound is this Anime is epic, The Voice actors are very good at their jobs eppeically Zoro and Luffy. The Music is full of epic win! Most of all, all of the sound effects sound like the real thing, which is always a good thing, you know somethings up when a sword sounds like a wet fish hiting a rock. 
 
The Characters are very well devolped, even the majority of the lesser know characters have somewhat of a devolped background and continue to devolpe in the anime, something most animes don't have. I like that One piece does this, as it adds to the well written universe the creators have made, and it also allows the One Piece world to expand. 
 
To finish things off, the amount of enjoyment i get out of this anime has only ever been rivaled by Death Note, comparing it to other animes of the same genre however, nothing has came close to topping how well everything in One piece goes, and sometimes I hope that the show will never end, because I find it that much of an enjoyment to watch. 
 
So go check it out, if it sounds intresting to you, if not, well i guess my review skills suck, and you should go read a diffrent one piece review :P

    One piece is the best anime, manga ive ever seen , why . cause its just a lot of fun in it and action and story and the characters are funny too and its just that one piece has a nice world and arc's , Now there is a boy that named Monkey d Luffy he wants to be a pirate king and find a treasure that named one piece and there his adventure starts whit collecting other pirate s he wants to start a crew and go search for the world and yess... there will be the bad people that are against them. So one piece had the best arc s ive ever seen i watched 100 episodes in one weak cause its a master piece go and watch it.

    This review will cover the first “half” of one piece (Ep 1-516) just so you can tell what period this is based on but I won’t give any spoilers so calm down. 
 
Let me start by saying my first introduction to one piece was through the 4kids dub and I have to say I didn’t mind it. Of course a few years later when I watched the original subbed version it really shows the major flaws with the 4kids version luckily I didn’t get too far into it. I have seen some of the FUNimation episodes and for those of you who do prefer English dub that would be the way to go. 
 
Now for the review… 
 
Story: One piece’s story is one of the best constructed anime series around, you watch it back and you can pick up references to people or events over 400 episodes in the future… that’s a well thought out story line. You see Luffy grow from a young child to a capable captain of a crew, dreaming of being king of the pirates! It’s not only Luffy that has a goal, every crew member has their own dream and these are explored as well. Each member of the Straw Hat crew is a main character, while not being as focused as Luffy, you see everybody’s backstory making every person someone you become attached to. One of the best features of this series is that it can deliver on the paths it chooses either if it’s a more fantasy styled setting like Skypiea or a hectic battlefield at Marineford each setting works in the one piece universe and the emotional connection you end up getting towards each character makes the comedy/heartbreak/success/failure of each plot a gripping one.   
 
Art: Honestly, when I first started watching it I didn’t enjoy the art style compared to other animes and a lot of the people I showed it to at that time had similar opinions but once you watch it for a bit it grows on you and you wouldn’t want to have it any other way. The way Oda has drawn the characters really has given him the opportunity to throw some very “unique” looking characters into the mix in the future episodes without them seeming out of place.      
 
Sound: The music and sound effects are perfect, if you watch the first OVA of One Piece you can hear the dominant sound of rubber being stretched every time Luffy makes an attack, while good for effect they made it look like it took a lot of effort in order to stretch. The anime series changed this making the sound not as harsh and as a result it makes the action more free-flowing. The music itself sets the mood exactly like it should and the times where a song you know becomes dominant in the series when something is about to go down really increases the effect the scene has one you. The voice actors also do a terrific job of conveying the right tone and volume for each scene. 
 
Conclusion: In the end I base my scores on how much enjoyment I felt while watching each series and in this series 10/10! And I don’t like giving out 10s but from the amount of wondrous time one piece has given me… it’s worth it and you should definitely watch it. 
 
 
First review, any feedback would be good to help improve future reviews. 
Thanks for reading.

    One Piece, originally a manga written by the genius Eiichiro Oda, was adapted into an anime in 1999.  
 
Both the manga and anime are still ongoing, even after hundred of episodes and chapters, and yet One Piece still remains more exciting and thrilling than ever. Even after 400 episodes, the story is getting better and better. It is extremely hard and rare to find animes that have more than 100 episodes... and to never loose its pace is surly an accomplishment.  
 
Oda has done something rare - he has created a convincing alternate reality with thousands of interesting characters and places. Each are unique and bizarre in their own way. 
 
One Piece is a unique and epic masterpiece which tells the story of a young pirate, named Monkey D. Luffy who sets off to sea to gather a crew and to become the most famous pirate who ever lived, by becoming the Pirate King.  
 
The character interaction between Luffy and his crew mates is brilliant in One Piece and never becomes dull. After hundreds of episodes of this show, I gradually became attached to Luffy's crew. This is much drama, fighting, and comedic moments in this grand anime. 
 
Since this show was made in 1999, the art for the first couple of episodes can turn people away from this series. The art, of course, gets a lot better as the series progresses and was always interesting for me regardless. It is always inticing to observe the bizarre and intriguing world that Oda has created. 
 
The soundtracks are also classics, and even to this day I occasionally listen to them on my youtube playlist. 
 
Watching One Piece has become a sort of a ritual for me, as I have been watching a new episode every weekend for the past couple years. One Piece is a timeless show that I plan to watch for years to come!!

    It's just sooo sad to see how shows like Bleach and Naruto are more popular than One Piece...it just goes to show how understimated this show rlly is... 
 
This is one of the few anime that have evrtyhing you would want in any series, from awsome action sequence, to hilarious comedy and then to drama. This is the only series, besides elfen lied, that has made real tears come from me. 
 
People shouldn't put a barrier between this show because the art style, which is what most ppl have problems with in this series, just because the style is unique and trying something new is not bad at all. Also, it shouldnt be judged by the bad job done on the dubbing of the series which totally killed it. 
 
There is a character for evryone here and anyone that truly calls themselves an anime fan should definitely give this show a try. It's no mistake the manga is #1 in Japan and since the naime is exactly like the manga...well u kno. 
 
Anyway, just don't judge a book by its cover and give it a shot!!!

    ""A man's dream will never die"" 
 
When I started my venture into anime, there were three shows that I told myself that I was not going to watch: Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. This is because these three show have one thing in common: They're still on the air. Watching a lot of anime is as bad as it sounds, but watching something and trying to catch up with is even worse. Plus, I mocked these three series for their appeal to the younger crowd. Then, suddenly I was told that One Piece, the childish-looking one out of them all, is actually the best out of all of them. To be honest, I always thought One Piece was the butchered piece of crap that was presented to me by 4Kids when I was younger. Then I found out that Funimation picked it up and re-dubbed it when 4Kids went out of business. I watched the first episode of Funimation dub...I have now seen all 10 movies, 430 episodes, and watched most of the OVAs. 
 
In other words, One Piece is one of the greatest and most addicting animes of all time. 
 
How could a show that I once regarded as juvenile be masterful? Well, first off it's not juvenile, in fact it's quite brutal. At first, it's starts off normal. We are introduced to our protagonist, the carefree and determined Monkey D. Luffy, the self-proclaimed future king of the pirates. He seeks to achieve this goal by forming the best pirate crew, sail the whole world, and find the legendary treasure, the One Piece. This is our first step into the brilliance of this show. Luffy, while not the brightest person and well-mannered person, is the character we as the audience want to look up to. While some can debate that his decisions always tend to cause destruction and violence, it's that utter lack of not having fear that chills go down my spine. It's the idea that we must go on our own adventures in life and pursue our dreams even if others say that they're dead and unreachable. 
 
However, we've all seen this story before right? There have been numerous stories about going the distance and following our dreams. What makes One Piece so different then? If I were to summarized One Piece in one line then it would be this: One Piece cuts the bull shit. Most stories about going the distance always have that one point where the characters give up or something happens that prevents and then something happens that suddenly makes them want to move forward. One Piece...there is no such thing. One Piece is all about becoming stronger. Stronger to stand up for the people you care for, stronger to advance on your journey, stronger to be ready for that final goal. This is One Piece's true accomplishment. 
 
The show also has a strong sense of humor. There are so many times where I have chuckled and even laughed out loud from the comedy of this show. Even if it's running gags such as Zoro's lack of direction or Sanji's weakness for beautiful women, there is always something fresh and some sort of new take on it. 
 
This leads me to my next point. One Piece not only emits happiness and laughter, but all other emotions as well. Emotions such as sadness, fear, hope, love, and sometimes even anger. We as the audience feel this because our main characters feel it as well. I can say that you will probably find something about yourself in the form of these characters. For example, like Luffy, I have always have had tried to fight for that one dream. Like Sanji, while his actions are exaggerated a bit, even I have to admit that I have always catered to woman's needs more than men. Like Usopp, I have always have felt like the weakest of group, the one who is inferior compared to my stronger peers. Like Robin, I have always felt like the one who was misunderstood, the one who has been labeled by society as this type of person. One Piece shows that sometimes it's okay to be different because even when the whole world is against you, there are people who will stand by your side and will fight to protect you. 
 
These character only then are brought to life by the people who play them. I have seen the first 205 episodes in English and it shows off what Funimation does best and makes up for what 4Kids did. After that, I switched from the English, as new dubbed episodes are coming out later this year, to the Japanese track where the voice acting is also top notch. It was interesting to know that some seiyuus here are actually well known. For example, Chopper's seiyuu is Pikachu, Zoro's seiyuu is Mugen from Samurai Champloo, and the one that I think that a lot of you are going shocked by is that Usopp is voiced by Kappei Yamguchi, the voice of L and older Detective Conan. Right now I have been introduced to the character Boa Hancock and her seiyuu is Kotono Mitsuishi, the original voice Sailor Moon, the voice of Misato from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Excel Excel from what else than Excel Saga. The voice actors do amazing jobs in both languages giving some truly powerful performances. It should also be addressed that the score to One Piece is unforgettable. The music of One Piece not only matches great anime scores such as Cowboy Bebop's or the original FMA anime, but even stacks up to John Williams and Danny Elfman film scores. Trust me when I say that after watching the show for a long time, background music will become so familiar to which you will start humming plus also indicating the type of situation that lies ahead. 
 
The animation of One Piece is also something of noteworthy. Unlike, traditional animes, the animation of One Piece is more of like of that of a combination of old animes, American cartoons, and in the hi-res episodes like that of conventional animes from today. In a way, it's a something of it's own style, probably the one thing that will make anime fans, who are used to animes looking like shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, not want to watch to this show. However, the cartoonish visuals of One Piece only makes it unique from everything else. While we do see some carbon copies of characters here and there, not often does a character look like another character and have the same personality. I tell you one thing, I have to admit while characters like Nami or Robin or any of the women in this show do have ridiculous anime proportions, it only makes me wonder are there woman in the world that possibly exist (oh it's times like this that hate that I'm a geek). 
 
However, this also allows me to say what you should know when watching it. Do not question anything that happens. I know that's a weird thing to say considering that ""no duh it's a cartoon it shouldn't be taken seriously."" However, I say this because the thing is the show keeps you so invested that you forget that a lot of wacky cartoonish things occur and some animes of this nature like to take themselves seriously when they shouldn't. Luckily, the show is aware of itself and often makes meta jokes about the characters and the situations that occur. 
 
I have seen a lot animes and the ones that I consider my personal favorites I wish have lasted longer than just 26 or 51 episodes. One Piece, on the other hand is still running to this day and to be honest when that day comes, it's going to be sad seeing the final adventure of the Strawhats. I love One Piece, it moves away from the standard conventional ideas and gives them the middle finger. Damsel in Distress, screw that, we already have two ladies that that can kick ass. Living by government rules to which One Piece answers, ""there is no honor in the government, it's full a people stubborn people who only do it for the sake of following orders."" What about villains? Clearly all of them have the same personality right? ""who is the real villain here, is it the government hunting the pirates, is it the other pirates, or it could it possibly be Luffy and the rest of the Strawhat Crew who are the real villains here?"" One Piece on the surface may look like the average shounen but deep down there is something more than just skinny yet large chested women and cool action fights. I'll just say this right now: One Piece is the first anime that made me cry. More than Wolf's Rain, Clannad, and Grave of the Fireflies. One Piece will be and should be remembered among anime fans as something as a tale of hopes and dreams. If you have not seen One Piece, then there is no better time than to start watching now. How can I put this: If you wanted to choose out of the big three (four if you include now Fairy Tail) shounens, then One Piece is your answer. I love it and I swear you are going to love it as well.

    The Story -  It starts out feeling Cliche with &quot;im gonna be king of the pirates&quot; by finding one piece! but really the story more revolves around Luffy wanting to go on adventures and if there's one thing that One Piece delivers on its the feeling of a huge world and a very very Epic adventure that you are almost not gonna get in any other anime.  
 
The Art - alot of people do not like the art style of one piece. but i myself find it very unique, so you actually feel like you're watching something very different in a very good way. 
 
The Sound - One Piece, in my opinion, has some of the very best japanese voice actors and the music in it is just phenomenal when something big happens you know its something big because the music that goes along with the show complements it all so well. 
 
Characters - unlike what seems to be the current standard of emo main characters and clingy annoying girls, this show breaks away from all of that using a very enthusiastic main character, and instead of a girl a clingy guy that is handled in a comedic manner instead of annoying. This show also has possibly the best character development of characters in any anime i have ever seen. when you watch the show you real get to feel like you know the character instead of just watching them. 
 
Enjoyment - You may look at the length of the show (which when this is written was almost 400) and say &quot;I'd prolly get bored watching such a long anime&quot; but this is not the case as the show just gets better the further you get. 
 
Overall - this anime is a must see for anyone who likes anime. and do not, i repeat, DO NOT watch the 4kids Dub, watch the sub, or else its a whole different experience.

    One Piece is one of the three kings of Shounen. This is an undisputed fact. The anime started back in 2000 (the manga in 1997), and has been going strong for over 10 years now. Given that, I think it's fair to say that if nothing more, something's gotta be going right for it to last that long. 
 
Now I, like everyone else who has reviewed the show, am giving it a 10, a rave review, and overall I've lopped off one of my fingers and replaced it with a thumb, solely to gain the ability of giving this show 3 thumbs up. But understand, I've re-watched this series from the beginning 4 times now, and read through the manga twice. I know One Piece inside and out, and I'm not here to simply rave. I'm here to give it a fair review. 
 
Shounen Syndrome is an anime infection with symptoms ranging from over-exposed attack explanations to lengthy conversations where they aren't necessary to horrendous filler arcs and even all the way to episode recaps that take up a good quarter of the time the episode is alloted. 
 
One Piece is not immune to this. No attack can simply go unnamed, or unexplained. Though they'll only explain it once, and it's usually not as horrible as it sounds. Though One Piece is in an interesting position in that they know it's ridiculous. The joking nature of the characters often brings up the ""It's not cool if it doesn't have a cool name"" mentality. So you could let One Piece off the hook to some extent, as it almost satirizes the rest of shounen by participating. 
 
One Piece also did something I'm not a big fan of. Starting around episode 300, they started using opening themes that lasted a full 2 and a half minutes. Followed by 30 seconds of intro, and then 30 seconds - 3 minutes of recap. Sometimes you'll have to start watching 6 minutes into the episode to actually get to new content. But this is both a blessing and a curse. For you see, One Piece filler tends to be pretty horrible. So, around episode 300, they upped the animation quality for widescreen TV. And to be able to put out this quality animation once a week, a shorter episode time makes the jobs of the animators easier, and production more cost effective. This meant a more quality product, in shorter spurts. The shorter spurts however, contribute to less filler. And for this reason alone, the reduced episode time and long recaps are in fact a blessing for One Piece fans. Though not many would know it. 
 
So what about the actual show? I'll assume if you're on this page, you already know a bit about One Piece. It's a show following the adventures of Monkey D Luffy and his ragtag crew of pirates searching for the great treasure ""One Piece,"" with the ambition of becoming the Pirate King (the one who rules over the greatest seas of the world). The story is solid, and has only been better developed over time. Oda has done something wonderful, in that he had his story planned out long before it got there, and it seems he's having even more fun with One Piece now than at the start of his career. This contributes greatly to the enjoyment factor One Piece provides. 
 
The art style is the biggest complaint I've heard about One Piece. A lot of people have told me they just flat out disliked the art style, and that was one of the biggest reasons they didn't want to watch the show. Though I can't understand this, I guess One Piece's art style is more cartoony than most anime. But that art style reflects the values of the series. It IS cartoony, in spirit. That's kind of the point. That being said, if that's not your thing, I can respect that. The other thing to mention about the animation is that it's been going since the year 2000. As such, earlier episodes definitely aren't up to snuff in terms of animation quality, especially as it's a shounen with a budget. But as the series and time progressed, the animation quality progressed as well and is now very well done. 
 
By far though, the characters in One Piece are what you enjoy the most. Luffy is your typical anime shounen, the kind of guy you can't help but love. He's simplistic and dim-witted, but his heart's in the right place and that's what sticks. Everyone is well written and typed, and the character development throughout the series is rather impressive. New synergies arise that both reflect Oda slipping into a more comfortable mindset whilst writing his character's parts, and the characters themselves becoming more accustomed to each other. 
 
Overall, One Piece has been going 10 years. And in those 10 years, the crew has grown up and developed with it's audience. Even given it's Shounen faults, it still does an absolutely wonderful job of story telling and entertaining. The main point I would bring up is never watch the 4kids dub. It's not One Piece. If there was one example I could provide to convince you of this, they turned a french chef into a brooklyn accented disaster... smoking a lollipop. 
 
That is One Piece. My most timeless anime. It's an experience I would recommend to any and all anime fans, though I know it may not be a good fit for many.

    I absolutely must write a review for One Piece because it's my favorite anime to date. Shonen-action wise, I think that One Piece easily beats competitors such as Naruto and Bleach. (Apparently, in Japan, it has sales that outrank Naruto and Bleach combined? That's quite the opposite of its status in America lol) Anyways, One Piece is an epic anime series. It has the awesome fighting that a shonen fan needs, it has an EPIC storyline, great character designs, (I love basically every character that Oda introduces other than the villians he makes that readers are suppose to hate so that when he gets his ass kick it'll be so much more satisfying, of course) an awesome awesome soundtrack, lots of intense drama, and just overall greatness. I even enjoyed *most* of the fillers; I felt that they were somewhat on par with the canon. It's a definite must watch for...everyone...WATCH IT!

    Well..let me make it simple for everyone..Its about this young boy who sets out on a journey to fulfill his dream of being the pirate king and finding the all time treasure known as One Piece. Gold D Roger the previous pirate king,had been captured and on the day of his death sentence he told the people hat he had left his treasure in the grand line which then started the great pirate age.The devil fruits in this anime grants inhumane power to anyone who eats it but is cursed to never be able to swim. 
People who havent watched this anime to watch it!!!!!!.If u have watched the 4kids dubbed version just erase it from your mind and watch the japanese version.Its funny and the way the characters are voiced are just absolutely great.In the beginning arcs it may be a little boring for some viewers but trust me and i seriously mean trust me..it gets way way way funnier and it gets way more interesting in the later episodes.believe me.To me there may be some expressions they make which can look a little lame but come on man nothings perfect :P.. 
 
Art: as for the art..u cant say its awesome.Its a little old and all but who cares XD you'll get used to it eventually if u continue watching :)  
 
Sound: good voice actors and actress that voices their characters ..i think they're very talented 
 
Character:Monkey D Luffy(Main MAIN character) .Along with his trusting crew mates .Roronoa zoro the swordsman , Sanji the perverted cook that loves women lol , chopper the doctor in the crew - shy and adorable, Nami - the navigator shes witty and quite violent, Nico Robin the archaeologist - she loves anything related to history, Usopp - the sniper of their crew, Franky - the ship wright of the crew and lastly Brook- im not so sure what he is but i know that hes a perverted dead skeleton dude that came back to life therese characters wont be introduced immediately but they will slowly be introduced later in the series 
 
Enjoyment: so far i have to  say this is a very enjoyable anime 
 
Overall id give it a 9 or 10 becos its really awesome :3

    After years of brushing it off, I decided to finally marathon the show about a month ago, and well, it’s not half bad if I’m being honest. 
 
Positives: 
 
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a setting as big and explored as the world of One Piece in any other anime before (And I’m guessing this is why it’s so popular too). It’s so imaginative and vibrant, so much effort is put into explaining how the setting works in terms of geography, history, factions, religion, government, lore, etc. Everything in the universe links together and many plot threads are consistently carried over and tied into future story arcs, to the point where I would never believe you if you don’t told me he was making it up as he went.   
 
The whole cast of characters all have unique character designs and distinct personalities. The main cast is quite fleshed out; you learn almost every detail about them, and their views and priorities slowly change over the course of the series. Same can be said for most side characters, and to some degree, they receive more character development than the main cast.  
 
The soundtrack is great and really matches the tone of the series (My favorite being “Overtaken” and the “Stone Storage Room”) and also compliments the scenes (The scene “Walk to Arlong Park” comes to mind). 
 
Negatives: 
 
Animation; the quality is just not good. It was decent at the start but gradually got worse as the series went on and really hit rock bottom after the timeskip (It looked like I was watching a slide show). 
 
It’s repetitive, some story arcs follow this structure of Go to new island->Residents have a dilemma->Fight & beat villain->Go to new island->Res… 
 
Pacing; this is why I will be dropping the series at this point, and will be switching to the manga (Eventually). IT’S SO SLOW. The pacing, just like the animation, was decent at the start but gradually got slower to the point where it felt like almost nothing was happening for 23 minutes. I even had to visit the wiki to find out that some story arcs are actually longer in the anime than the manga, and this is without filler, meaning that they adapt less a chapter per episode, just, no. 
 
Overall, it has its faults but it’s a fine shonen (At least until the timeskip where the animation severely declines), and this is what I would ultimately consider to be THE adventure shonen.

    The story of One Piece is a long and enjoyable experience. It makes you care for the characters and their bonds; you become emotionally invested in their success. However, the anime is a disappointment to say the least. The length of scenes are stretched to a ridiculous degree. Every episode covers one chapter, but that includes an intro song, an outro song, and a long unnecessary recap. If you catch up you will constantly be waiting a week just for the characters to almost do something. and as the series gets farther into the story the animation gets worse. If you are interested in this series; read the manga. Its a great story, but the anime just isn't worth the time investment.

    Episode 898 proved it again, this Anime is not worth the time. What happened? It began so strongly, with an anmiation and art-style which needed some time to get used to it but once you did, it suddenly fit. Moreso the story was so rich after a while, you didn't even think about it. 
 
But let us get to the present time.  
 
The most recent Episode showed perfectly what is wrong with One Piece. It drags too much. It takes up to 5 minutes and sometimes longer with one character building up his technique. To fill more time, the main characters fight side characters who have no purpose in the story than just to get beaten up. But it takes up so much time as if something interesting is happening. You learn nothing new, there is no story progress, but those battles takes 10 minutes and more of the airtime. It is always used for comedic purposes and to show how strong the mc is. We know. We saw it 6000 times already. It doesn't matter if you put cool music under it, even the music starts to become unbearable. The mangaka Oda knows, he draws one or two panels with those and moves on. 
 
The worst part are the One Piece apologists. And i don't mean those who truly enjoy the show and defend it, bless them. I mean those who see the problems, are aware of it, they don't like it either but since they protected and defended this show since the beginning against Naruto and Bleach, yes that far back the Big 3 times, it became their second nature. 
 
If i didn't invest so much time in this show i would've dropped it. The characters are likeable though some characters now became so one-dimensional, they became boring. I don't see this as much of a problem because i trust Oda to create an arc where they will get a progress. 
 
As already stated, the characters, even side characters are the strong point of this show. The story is interesting and is building up since years, though you still can't see where it is going. Enel going to the moon, when everybody thought he is just mad, seems to have a bigger plot role than thought. This is how One Piece catches you. You can engage in many theories and conspiracies. Who doesn't love to do that? 
 
I've long decided to read the manga and the only reason i watch the show is because of my little cousin who likes to come over and watch it with me, since i pamper him. He still enjoys it, but he is 8.

    3 Simple words: BEST ANIME EVER !!! 
 
The big 3: Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, but to me, One Piece is the only big one. 
 
This one contains the least fillers of the big 3. Even tough every character gets introduced over a couple of episodes (in which you learn about their history and create a real connection), all eps are relevant to the series. Even episodes that look like fillers at 1st, get some part in the main story afterwards... 
 
A friend of mine said I had to watch this anime and he was right, so now I'll tell you the same, WATCH IT.

    Initially I was wary of watching this popular shounen anime as I preferred shoujo or romance anime. I also thought the art was sort of wonky at first, but upon starting this show I was overwhelming pleased. The story and art are, for lack of better words, amazing. I began watching One Piece two months ago and caught up to the 455 episodes in that time and can't wait for more releases each week. Although OP is considered part of the Jump trifecta along with Naruto and Bleach it's really in a league of its own, far surpassing these two in enjoyment and story. Frankly, the others aren't worth watching at all. One Piece has amazing flow between episodes and VERY few filler arcs.  
 
Luffy is also one of the greatest main characters of all time and is supported by an amazing cast that really allows the viewer to understand One Piece's overarching theme of being ""nakama."" Even the secondary characters are extremely lovable.  
 
One Piece is definitely worth watching no matter what type of anime you are into. It definitely doesn't leave you disappointed.

                   I don't understand why some people were put off by the arts at first. I just thought it was different when I saw it. I enjoyed the first few episodes and laughed a good couple of times and quickly labeled this show as &quot;For entertainment only&quot; since I thought it was some sort of Random-Funny clip shonen that takes a while to end.  
 
               But as I continued to watch it and up to the Arlong arc, I was SHOCKED TO DEATH. I didn't know it could get so emotional and deep but it manages to be light hearted at the same time. I was so utterly charmed by Luffy and his crew's personality. They practically highlight each other perfectly, like the colors of a rainbow, they all stick together but each of them stand out, nobody is the same color. 
 
               Others are for you to actually watch and find out what it's really about. I mean, people don't just say it's good for no reason.

    I started watching this in 2008 and I was immediately hooked on it. I loved every bit of it - the pirate theme, the art style, the characters, the story. 
 
It has been pretty much amazing until episode 381, or in other words - the end of the Thriller Bark Arc. Up to this point, the plot lines of the arcs were really fantastic, the art style was good, the fights were engaging, I just couldn't wait to see the next episode. 
 
But after that point, where they were entering Shabaody Archipelago, the show somehow lost its ""magic"" for me. I suddenly didn't care as much about what happens next and the excitement was diminishing. At the time I didn't take notice of that, but around the time of writing this in 2019, I finally realized that I no longer care about One Piece anymore - I did not care about the characters, about the fights, about how the story goes on, I just kept tuning in every Sunday morning to watch the new episode, because it had become a part of my routine for over 7-8 years. 
 
Now the art style has changed and at first I was on board with with, but later on I started noticing that the unique character of One Piece is gone with this new style. The colors of everything look somehow really bright and vibrant, and yet, at the same time - really washed out and dull, especially now in Whole Cake Island Arc. Where everything is so colorful and yet it looks dull and boring. 
 
The cannon fodder enemies that get knocked out by the dozens and once and don't even have names used to look somehow more unique and quirky, now they look really generic and similar. The same observation can be made about the main characters and even the supporting characters, main villains and supporting villains. Enemies like Captain Kuro, Don Krieg, Enel, Crocodile, etc. looked unique and interesting, but now enemies like Charlotte Family who never made an appearance before look very uninspired, it's like the author wanted to make some random, generic weird characters for the sake of making weird and quirky characters, but he failed at making them unique. Even the art style of the Straw Hats changed from being quirky and likable to overly-perfect, refined and with that - somehow boring and unlikable. 
 
The story arcs in the first part of the series (up to and including Thriller Bark) were interesting and unique, but now they feel boring, prolonged and utterly uninspired. Even Dressrosa, which people praise as a good arc, I found it to be very boring and a drag. Arcs like from when Luffy fought Alvida up to Loguetown have been a precious experience for me that I will never forget. When they crossed Reverse Mountain and entered the quirky otherworldly Grand Line, everything on the excitement scale got turned to 893593548935843. It has been the most epic part of the series (all the way up to episode 381). 
 
Character development has been insignificant and at first that was okay, because the show remained happy-go-lucky without being boring, but by episode 870, the character development hasn't been very significant and coupled with the other (and growing) negative aspects of the series, it is becoming very hard to watch. 
 
Overall, I think that the author Eiichiro Oda's inspiration for One Piece has diminished or has completely disappeared. He probably only draws the manga with the only goal to finish it and retire. His passion seems completely gone and what made the anime/manga/series interesting and exciting doesn't exist anymore. At this point I've lost all interest to continue watch the series and will be dropping them, I'm considering moving to the manga at this point only to see how it ends. 
 
In my opinion the show stops being good after episode 381 and my personal advise would be to stop watching there and move to the manga. If you don't believe me, you can go ahead and continue to watch, but you will probably feel the same way like me after you catch up. 
 
EDIT: I tried reading the manga into Wano Arc and even that's boring and horrible. At this point I've completely dropped One Piece. I tried to rewatch it again from episode 1 to episode 381 with the original animation, but around episode 125 in Alabasta, I lost interest, not that it's bad, it's just not the same after seeing it.

    What can i say? Its a Masterpiece . All other stories only care about fights but not this one . One piece is about the Story. One Piece has great fights too but fights are not its priority. Watch it if you want great story with comedy,action,sadness all the different kind of emotions then definitely watch it .  
 
But if you're not hooked by episode 60 then drop it , its not for you. One Piece just gets better and better  with every arc. Even if it didnt hook you up after 40 episodes it will definitely hook you up at 200+ episodes point.

       What could possibly be more exciting then being a pirate sailing the seas battling against other pirates, getting into ruffles with the government at the same time searching for new crew members and for the ultimate treasure? Sounds like an adventure eh? The surprising thing about One piece is that every small thing to the very detail is done to the finest level. I cant complain about any facet of this show and ill tell you why.  
 
One piece does everything surprisingly well, it possesses an entertaining story, with interesting characters and even mixes in intense drama which is huge since the show is a comedy first type show. One piece starts off with the main protagonist Luffy, one of the most ridiculous looking pirates ever, in search of the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. This treasure was hidden somewhere in mysterious oceans known as the grand line by the greatest pirate in history Gold D. Rodger. Nearly every episode is hilarious as you watch this half-minded pirate do incredible things, meet incredible pirates and so on. For anyone who watches Action shonen animes like Naruto or Bleach, One piece actually does something better then those shows, it entertains fans nearly every episode(although a few fillers exist here and their, they are still quite entertaining) and it knows how to present a story with very fascinating characters. 
 
I&rsquo;m calling all anime fans to check out this great series but I would be doing you a disservice by not informing you of the fallowing: DO NOT WATCH IN ENGLISH SUBS. This show was introduced in Japanese and is excellent in its original without censorship. The American censorship attempts to water down the show for children by removing heavily violent scenes and explicit plots. The English voice actors are horrible as well&hellip; need I say more? Anyway watch one piece you are guaranteed laughs and an adventure.

    I deserve a trophy. As of this writing, I have watched 577 episodes. At the very least I'm entitled to a ribbon for participation. Please excuse the satire, yet fully stated, following One Piece is a life decision you can't go back on. I've heard stories and things labeled as 'larger-than-life' from time to time, which as a literal thing is hard to imagine, and I'll tell you One Piece is larger than those things. If something truly is larger-than-life, as some frightful things are, it would lose recognizably, and have to appeal on upheaval or shock. One Piece is not larger than life. Hear me say, with all appeal, that One Piece delivers as large as life can. 
 
Now the life of a subject notwithstanding, there's the honest directive. One Piece is indeed huge. The manga has been serialized since 1997 and the anime airing since 1999. I'm amazed every time I'm reminded of this. Stories are rarely if ever allowed a life so long. Sense dictates the market at large would become bored, yet it marches on. I've only come to the series in 2010 myself, which is truly stunning both how long it took to finish and how it still converts so far into its lifespan. 
 
Shōnen giants have meritable criticism. Drawn out plots, dragging episodes, truly few bursts of action, and many disposable characters. It would be a bold-faced lie to claim that One Piece is an exception. The popular obeys popular formula. Only the contrarian will find problem with that and, besides, unimaginable popularity is not well-liked by the hipster generation. I once held One Piece to disdain. 4kids produced a very awful dub I saw on saturday mornings as a kid. Its huge popularity seemed unjustified to my closed eyes. A fan of something so huge and bland would likely be boring, a sheep coddled by peers and fearful of anything outside their comfort zone. Simple minded fans always exist, so do not take my elitist prejudice to heart. It's no quality I'm proud of. 
 
Winter break listlessly rolled by. I was a freshman in college and belatedly frustrated with my social situation. That may or may not matter. Animation has never been a focal point in my life, but I will always very much enjoy a good story. It doesn't matter where or how it comes to me - just if it reminds me of something, anything, important. There are infinite ways to look at life. I'll tell you why I watch animation to tell you why I finished One Piece, because it is the same. I was looking for something to burn out with, insomniac halfway into winter, my strength fissured into coping instead creating. That is when I want things to move in front of me instead of me moving them myself.  
 
What made me choose to start watching One Piece, and I mean definitively, I cannot say. I reasoned I deserved to give the show another chance - it was popular for a reason or something along those lines - but looking back there was nothing logical behind it. There isn't much logic to go around at three in the morning. I watched twenty episodes straight, ending at noon the next day. The show's whimsy and optimism - in a same line Luffy's childishness and excitement - kept me rapt during a dank time. It may have been a false attachment at first, but from Zoro's backstory forward I was in a combined state of excitement and satisfaction. Episodes turned like simple pages in a story, speeding forward until I reached an insane one hundred episode total. A long show spans a hundred episodes, but One Piece barely begins. 
 
In the middle of the Arabasta arc, some hundred episodes in, I actually had to justify and think about why I watched the show. Before then, watching continued effortlessly, just as only wanting to know what happens. Whether or not a story provokes such a feeling is only a trick of pacing and has nothing to do with quality. Eventually, everything becomes evaluated, and despite being bored with the Straw Hats wandering forever in the desert, I found it was not simple joy, excitement, or shameful pacing that held my attention, though they did help. It was the show's surprising depth, not only in character development, but the attention to detail put into the entire world. 
 
If you make it to the Water 7/Enies Lobby continual arcs, know that you've reached the single part of the story that enables me to say One Piece matches up to any great and peerless execution of storytelling. There are many stories with that honor, however, that makes it no less of a feat. Without giving much away, there is driving contention in the crew caused by a practical problem and a more sinister one. A new character's main reason for living intersects with one protagonist's main reason to die. An old protagonist finally succumbs to his lasting doubts and shadows, acting most shocking and out of character for the genre - but thankfully not the show. The main villians are inexplicable and hard to believe at first, yet after, and somehow because of, initial appearances, they are more than enough to drive the story forward. The many conflicts, subplots, and rapid changes make this story arc the most complex and rewarding in the series and allow me to recommend One Piece to anyone without a shadow of a doubt. 
 
I nearly quit in the second half of the Skypiea arc. It encompasses many of the bad points of the show - many bland characters outside the main cast (from Enel's wacky helpers to the clueless Conis), overkill pacing (Satori's ridiculous ""Trial of Balls"" lasted like four episodes), and few moments of excitement (Chopper had the only respectable fight and it was against a guy who would forget to open his mouth when speaking). However, snuck close to the end of the arc are three entirely wonderful episodes concerning a Montblanc Norland. They have nothing to do with the main plot - even occurring 400 years in the past from the main characters - and yet is of the greatest subplots One Piece has. The show had before convinced me of a world to breathe in, but somehow it had me interested in its history, even without a real pay off. Anything concerning a Gol D. Roger is even more exciting and equally removed from Luffy's quest, all to an extent. There aren't many stories where even its history remains interesting and convincing. 
 
If you haven't seen the show, I realize my review isn't being very accessible anymore. There is so much to cover when something is so long, so I know not to try to cover everything. One Piece truthfully remains very consistent throughout its entirety. Though many major plotlines have been boring or even poor from times, the show has never been dedicated to a major plot, or it would have ended by now. When others describe why they enjoy the show so much, many point to its character development, comedy, art style, and its densely woven plot. Especially liked is the very intense chekhov's army. Characters and concepts introduced anywhere in the show appear and reappear when it's appropriate (and many times even when it is not, such as Usopp befriending giants for no reason than knowing other giants), but appropriateness truly does not matter, for the directive is to make events connected, so that the characters live in a present represented by a real past. 
 
There is beauty in telling a story about a world, instead of only about characters, or only about a thing. To use a daft example, the Lord of the Rings has a fantastic reputation as a fantasy novel, maybe even recognized for the wrong reasons (thank hollywood). The Lord of the Rings is a post-modern epic and I mean that literally. I shall define an epic that lives in its folklore and obeys it completely, like a recognizable Greek epic The Odyssey. I want to believe the greatness of an epic is not totally reliant on its heroic characters, though they contribute greatly. A fantasy epic takes a picture of an impossible world and makes it a possibility. Those are the simplest terms, but it is not the act of creation that is important, it is the completeness. The world's culture, laws, & customs are obeyed naturally in the telling and the characters, while important, impact overall a small part in history. 
 
When I think of Lord of the Rings, I don't think too much of its band of heroes, the struggle of good versus evil, or the strength of good nature. For me what stays is how detailed the world is and how far Tolkien went. It is a story about Frodo and the Ring, and yet it is a world of so much more. One Piece can be called post-postmodern, if you're silly, because it is very much simple and bright instead of being grim and refined. Wouldbe epics try to be grim and defined. And wouldbe epics do not have a world I believe in, which is why they're only caricatures of the worlds around us. One Piece, at a certain point, became a true fantasy epic. It is a story about Luffy and finding One Piece, and yet it is a world of so much more. Everything surrounding the characters oozes with careful thought. One Piece no longer feels only like Luffy's story or just the story of the Straw Hat pirates but a recounting of history by the movers and makers themselves - a fictional history that feels so very real. 
 
I remember my cousin over and we were eating pizza. It was shortly into winter break. My hand was my plate, pizza doesn't need a plate, but he was holding a plate with pizza. Eating pizza, holding pizza, he looked liked he wanted to say something and didn't know how. The need to share won over the insecurity of sharing and he asked me if I ever heard of a show called One Piece. Call it coincidence, still, I had just watched Luffy's final fight with Crocodile and was able to express how much I liked the show. He was a bit farther, starting the Davy Back fights if I remember, and was very excited that the insecurity never existed. He was excited he had someone to share this world with, I'd guess. At first, when we talked about the show, we would focus on the main characters and talk about what fights we liked, what lines we liked, what backstories we most appreciated, and inevitably what characters were the best. 
 
Two years later, we have both finished the show, and end up talking about it when we see eachother, at least to discuss the most current episodes. Sometimes the discussion spills over when either mentions how much we like the show, or how such and such used to be better, or what arcs we loved and hated. Now when we talk about One Piece it could easily last hours - it is, after all, nearly 200 hours long - yet we do not focus on the main characters as we used to. A comparatively small part of our talks touches on the protagonists, partially because we both know them so well, mostly because we're talking about the world at large. One piece has a world you can picture, a world you can really talk about, a world to be excited for. I very much like stories, as I say, but it's hard to say flat things about a whole world. I very much like worlds too. It's different, to say the least, and despite any insipid moment, I believe One Piece is a world worthy of any others and is an absolute joy to experience.

    I used to fall into the trap of &quot;The 4Kids dub = One Piece&quot;, so I figured One Piece was some totally lame series that only appealed to little kids. I actually got into One Piece after visiting a crack community on LiveJournal (capslock_op). I decided to check it out, but I was hesitant. Then, I ended up reading volumes 1-14 in under a month! (I know I'm reviewing the anime, but I read the manga first.) 
 
One Piece has very believable characters. The main crew members all have very real, very believable personalities. The storyline is interesting and easy to follow--hardly anything ever goes unexplained, so there are no loose ends or awkward plot holes (which is a problem I encountered with Bleach.) It has a great balance of humorous and serious moments.  
 
A lot of people seem to complain about the art style being &quot;bad&quot;, but I don't think that's the case. I think that One Piece's art style is appropriate for the mood and style of the series itself. It's entertaining and a little bit goofy. If One Piece's art style were &quot;better&quot;, it wouldn't be the same. Sure, sometimes there are some really oddly drawn frames, but the bulk of the animation is pretty good. Even some of the &quot;better&quot; animations have their &quot;wtf?&quot; moments.

    One Piece is a fun show, plain and simple. Normally, I'm all about serious, intelligent anime, but One Piece is my big exception. There are a lot of good, high class shows out there worth watching for the artistic value. But we can't forget the main purpose anime is designed for: entertainment. And when it comes to pure, non-thought-provoking entertainment, it's hard to beat a kid literally made out of rubber beating the crap out of a clown who can disassemble himself. (And that's just Season One! There's much crazier stuff than that.) 
 
What I love about One Piece is that it never even tries to be serious. The characters are all zany, yet they remain engaging enough to hold the attention of someone like me who looks for something with a little more substance than your average kid's show. New main characters are gradually introduced throughout the series, and each one makes a meaningful contibution. Most of these characters are added when Luffy, the self-appointed captain of this crew, randomly decides he likes them and wants them to come along which adds to the silliness. 
 
Another aspect of this show that sets it apart from the rest of the shounen action crowd is the consistency of the characters abilities. The members of the Straw Hat Crew are never forced to undergo some random quantum leap in power level in order to defeat their enemies. This means that despite the fact that the show is currently almost 350 episodes in length, none of the characters have experienced the continuous exponential increase in power seen in other shows that would otherwise give them the abilities of Superman by this point. 
 
Despite the length of the series, the material for each new episode is usually fresh, with a surprisingly small amount of filler and recap (though it does have some.) The action moves along fast enough that each new episode is simultaneously satisfying, yet leaves the viewer looking forward to the next one. 
 
I'd say the main weakness of the show is the tendency to crank up the cheesiness factor just a little beyond my tolerance point on occasion. Other viewers could be affected by this to a greater or lesser extent than I am; it's really all a matter of personal preference. One other disclaimer: do not watch the 4kids dubbed version. Just about any fansub is better, since the dub is censored and material is removed to such an extent that the quality is adversely affected.

    Before watching One Piece I was skeptical of watching it. It was one of the most popular animes out there but it just did not look like my sort of thing. Eventually my friend who got into anime started watching it and told me of its greatness, but I was still put off it. Finally after nagging me to watch it I caved in and started. I am glad that happened as it has to be one of my favourite anime's ever! 
 
Story (10) 
The story at first may sound simple. A young pirate sets out to find a crew and the lost treasure of one piece, although it quickly becomes more and more complex with all the stories of each character to the individual arcs. Oda has created a huge world like no other. Simply amazing. 
 
Art (9) 
The art at the start of One Piece may not look that great but that's because it was made in 2000. The art gradually gets better and throughout the 400+ episodes it starts to get amazing. Everything is thoroughly detailed. 
 
Sound (10) 
I loved the opening and endings to the anime aswell as the sounds that the characters make when they are doing their special moves. It makes the anime come alive. 
 
Character (10) 
One pieces characters are revolutionary. They are detailed in both art and story. The back stories of each character and their personalities are amazing. 
 
Enjoyment (10) 
One piece was a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs. Places when I would be in stiches from laughing or tearing up in some of the emotional episodes. One piece has everything in it from Comedy to drama to a bit of romance. I highly enjoyed this anime from start to finish. I nearly went 24 hrs watching episode after episode since It kept me wanting more. 
 
Overall (10) 
Overall I would rate this anime a 10/10 simply because it is unbelievable. I am glad that I gave this anime a chance and would thank my frend for introducing it. It is probably my favourite anime right now

    I created an account just so that I could write this review. I started watching One Piece four or five years ago, and still find myself moved by this amazing series. 
 
I have seen and enjoyed many anime, from Gintama, to Death Note, to Legend of Galactic Heroes, to Trigun, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, a plethora of Gundams, and many others. One Piece has something that none of them have. In fact, One Piece has something that perhaps no other form of motion picture entertainment today has:  rock-solid, consistently good writing. Good writing is hard to find, but good writing that can stay consistent and true to a massive overarching storyline through 500+ episodes?  
 
At first glance, One Piece presents itself as superficial, formulaic, light-hearted fun, but then it  catches you off-guard with its depth of character, its surprising plot twists, its amazingly complicated and well-developed world, and its wisdom into the desires of the human heart. It lulls you into thinking you've figured it out, and then surprises you yet again. Plot threads left dangling for hundreds of episodes suddenly become significant again and seamlessly weave themselves back into the storyline, and you realize that you are viewing a grandly designed epic that is genuinely designed to span years. 
 
I have seen far too many shows that start off great, and then reach a point where the author or writers start floundering around and basically start just making the plot up as they go along.  
*Cough*Cough*Bleach*Cough*Naruto*Cough*LOST,DEAR GOD LOST*Cough. 
 
Not so with One Piece. Every story arc fits into place in a larger tapestry of the main plotline, and does so in some amazingly imaginative ways. 
 
 
In terms of artwork, One Piece certainly can be strange, but overall it contains some of the most original and fantastic locations and character designs you will ever see, anywhere. In terms of animation, it does occasionally suffer from the fluctuating quality levels that most long-running series have. 
 
The pacing is good, in general, although there are a few times where it feels like certain events are dragged out a bit longer than necessary, although it never reaches Dragonball Z-like proportions. Many of the of the arcs feel like they slow down right before the big conclusion, but in a way this only heightens the emotion at the conclusion of each arc. And believe me, every arc has a powerful climax. 
 
The music is fantastic, although noticeably repeated. It's difficult to have original music for 500 episodes, after all, and it's only to be expected. Many of the tunes are very catchy, though, and I love how main characters are associated with particular themes in true Wagnerian fashion. 
 
The characters are the best part of the show, and I would rate this anime higher than 10 for character if possible. They are all fantastically written, both amusing and bad-ass, and tremendously consistent in personality. The Japanese voice acting for them is also utterly perfect, and while I admit some other anime dubs are decent, I highly recommend watching this one in the original language. 
 
One Piece never fails to move me emotionally, and always in a positive way, leaving me feeling better about life in general. Paraphrasing something Luffy said once, ""As long as you are alive, something good can happen to you."" I started watching this show with my friends years ago, and I will treasure that time spent, both as a reminder of some good times I shared, and because One Piece is simply an amazing journey. 
 
 
- Happy Sailing

    You'll either love it or hate it. There is no in between. 
 
The time is The Great Pirate Era. To find the treasure the legendary pirate Gol D. Roger left behind, One Piece, countless pirates have endured death. The boy who ate the Rubber fruit, Monkey D. Luffy, set out to the seas with the Pirate King as his goal. On his way, Luffy has met countless comrades. Today, they continue to sail through the greatest sea of all: The Grand Line. 
  
Accompanied by great soundtracks, Monkey D. Luffy and his nakama sail across the world. As they fight corrupt governments, bounty hunters or other pirates, they meet new friends, develop their character and occasionally give the viewer some comedic relief. The art may not be outstanding. Since the anime is catching up to the manga. there is some filler along the way and the recaps and previews are getting longer.  
 
So what? If you find comedy, fighting, music and character development in anime more important than anything else, you won't mind those small details. This is truly shounen as it should be.  
 
Note: I strongly recommend you watch the subbed version. Although Funimation did a quite good job on the dubs, it was abused by 4Kids before Funimation took over.

    Hands down, the best anime I have ever seen! 
 
 
Story is about a boy, Monkey D. Luffy who is aiming to become the Pirate king. On his way there he will need to conquer the sea, and meet up many new friends and ofc - Nakama. The everything is okay at first, but as anime progresses, story grows up to amazing proportions! I don't want to spoil all the great fun you could enjoy by watching it so i'l just give a few rates. 
 
Story: 9 - Pretty simple thing grows into something much wider and interesting, deserves the grade rightfully 
 
Sound: 9 - Great sound effects displayed through the series, even has few of it own songs (for instance ""Bink's sake"", really great one), and great sound effects. 
 
Characters: pure 10 - The crew meet up a whole bunch of characters, that are again - unique. I think that One piece has the richest line up of characters of all animes i watched,heard about or will watch in the future. And again nearly all of them played or will play, big or small role in the series. 
 
Enjoyment - Pure 10, as somewhat fan of anime, and BIG fan of pirates, I would personally give it 30/10, but that grade isn't available :D Even the ones that aren't necesserily fans of pirates/pirate era, will again like this series in some other way, because its simply flawless! 
 
Overall - Pure 10/10! 
 
 
P.S.  
As someone who experienced it, as well as many of other people as I heard, I must say from critic view that old ""4kids"" english dub did a pretty lousy job, poor voice acting and a lot of erased stuff. I almost dropped the series on episode 2 because of it. Back then I strictly watched DUBBED series, but I figured it would be a waste not to try, and tried out SUBBED version of the series, and I must say that I was STUNNED by a drastic change of the quality and enjoyment. So I just kept going on and on with the series, catching up in a really short period of time. I heard that ""Funimation"" started doing the job all the way from the start, in uncut version. Haven't seen it so I can't say anything on that subject, but I suggest you try SUBBED version anyway, after all it's original :))) 
 
 
My first review, hope it helps!

    You can understand that people have no taste when this anime has 8,53 score 
 
The best excuse one can give for liking this ""awesome anime"" is that it apparently teaches them friendship and bonds and tryhard or whatever, AKA qualities that every normal functioning human should already have 
 
Moving on to the story, everyone seems to forget that the show is about P-I-R-A-T-E-S, and who can blame them when people in said universe can drop meteors from the sky, transform into giant Chinese dragons etc. Yay for piracy 
 
Characters are beyond nauseating, as women only exist to be sexist symbols and as for guys the top IQ is probably around 50 at best. You have a main character which has a Rubber Fruit with over 100 abilities and uses, one more overpowered than the other. Super Saiyan Goku can destroy galaxies and in the crossover episode was even power with just Gear 2nd (iiii diii bUt He WaS hOlDiNg BaCk To EnJoY tHe BaTtLe diiiiiii) 
 
No moment can be taken seriously because you just got characters with giant mouths and teeth yelling, then some sad music plays and the viewers are supposed to sympathize, feel sad etc 
 
MC is beyond sickening, 0 character development and a non functioning brain (perhaps it turned into rubber as well), perhaps every 100 episodes or manga chapters he will glare at the bad guy or say some sort of inspirational quote about his friends yada yada and people will go nuts 
One could say that ""ii diiiii bUt SuPeR sAiYaN gOkU aLsO hAs A lOt Of FoRmS dilililiiiiiiiiii"" but the difference is that he's been training for all his life, plus people of his race could just as easily obtain the same sort of power and forms (as well as other races). In One Piece MC has the Rubber fruit which has over 100 forms and powers and hidden abilities, each unlocked randomly and when needed to defeat a certain opponent who's been honing their skills all the time (Doflamingo being top example). Basically Rubber Fruit > God in One Piece, as MC will defeat people who can use Darkness itself, Light itself, steal souls, Magma, drop freaking meteors from outer space, become chinese giant dragons who can spout flames, you probably can already realize that this is as ridiculous as it sounds 
 
Typical One Piece battle: Bad guy has insanely overpowered fruit which they have been honing for years and terrorize whole islands/cities/countries. Rubber boy: 
a) punches kicks or headbutts them to defeat with rubber powers instantly 
b) deus ex machina form / new move he unlocked during his during-timeskip training but never used till now cause why not 
c) for logia overpowered users, deus ex machina haki which can match theirs and surpass it > repeat a) and b) 
d) scream with a giant mouth and teeth cause that equals strength and justice 
e) ??? 
f) MC wins 
Also bonus points if all MCs sustain beyond death injuries during the battle, which they survive and recover from instantly (Zoro vs Mr.1, please someone do justify that), only to proceed to annihilate the bad guys immediately afterwards 
 
Bad guys just wait at their islands for MC and crew to defeat them, much like Pokemon Trainers in Pokemon games, they just exist there stationary till MC passes in front of them 
 
10-15 years since anime came out and creator has the nerve to say we are halfway done, yea good for you I guess, yay for creativity 
 
You can hate this review all you want but at the end of the day you know every bit of it is true, deep inside you know that the only reason you like One Piece is because you want to be a part of the mass

    One Piss is hands down one of the most childish and badly written Shounen I've come across. There is absolutely nothing interesting about One Piss. It fails at literally everthing it tries to attempt. These are the reasons why One Piss is trash. 
 
STORY: 0/10 
 
One Piss is about a trash character called ""Luffy"" that wants to become the pirate king. He gathers a crew of even more awful characters that also have dreams of their own. Almost all of these characters are one dimensional and do absolutely nothing to accomplish their goals. Nami wants to draw a map of the world, yet there isn't a single scene in the manga showing her draw anything. Usopp wants to be a brave warrior, yet after 800+ episodes he's still a coward. Sanji wants to find All Blue, he does absolutely nothing to accomplish his dream. Luffy wants to become pirate king yet there are so many filler arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with this.  
 
Here are some examples of arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with the story: Alabasta, Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Drum Kingdom, etc. None of these arcs have anything to do with Luffy becoming the pirate king, yet they each are at least 40 chapters. Even the arcs that are actually relevant are awful. Dressrosa is one of the most poorly written Shounen arcs I've come across. 120 episodes of one arc, bad characters that get too much screen time, generic villain with a generic back story, terrible animation, slow pacing, etc. It cant get any worse than that. For some reason Oda isn't capable of making a story arc that isn't extremely long anymore. He says that he isn't going to make long arcs after dressrosa, yet he makes even more bad arcs that are too long.  
 
One Piss arcs are essentially the same thing every single time. The plot is very formulaic. They go to an island and make friends, beat up the bad guys that are oppressing the country, new cremember (sometimes), feast, and then repeat. I mean it continues this bullshit over and over again for over 800 episodes. It already starts to get boring during the Skypiea arc, I'm surprised I could actually tolerate the rest of this trash. 
 
One Piss has some of the worst fights I've seen in Shounen. It's actually hilarious how One Piss fans criticize other Shounen like Fairy Tail because of ""friendship powerups"". One Piece does the exact same thing. Every single fight is won by Luffy's sheer willpower, not because he actually outsmarted his opponent. Every One Piss fight is the same exact thing: Luffy tanks evey hit, villain tanks every hit, but then somehow the villain loses because he isn't as durable as Luffy. This is why One Piece fights are extremely boring. It always just ends in asspulls/plot armor. Luffy has won many fights that he shouldn't have won, especially his battle against Katakuri. Katakuri injures himself because a random character interfered in their fight. If you cant see how much a contrived plot device that is, then I don't know what to tell you. 
 
One thing One Piece fans praise about this series is how good the world building is. In my opinion, it doesn't mean SHIT if One Piece has good world building. Why should I care about how detailed Oda made the world of One Piece when the crew is just stuck on one island for 100 chapters? The world building is irrelevant if we barely even get to see the rest of the world, besides the Island they spend 200 chapters on. For fucks sake they've only been on 5 for over 300 episodes. 
 
 
CHARACTERS: 0/10 
 
There are rarely any interesting characters in One Piss For the most part, all of the main characters are poorly written. They just get their sad and generic backstories and then they never get character development again. A perfect example of this would be Nami. Sad backstory, then gets no development for the rest of the series. Usopp is another example. After 800 episodes, Usopp still is acting like a coward. 800 episodes and yet he still didn't develop whatsoever.  
 
I used to like Sanji until post time skip One Piss completely ruined him. He hasn't had any shine in post timeskip. He loses every damn fight, and he wasn't even in the most important arc of the timeskip. Then Oda makes an arc all for Sanji, which ended up being absolute trash. He just gets a generic sad backstory, doesn't actually change as a character, and then he still gets no shine whatsoever. No one should ever compare this trash character to Zoro. 
 
Speaking about Zoro, he's the only straw hat that actually developed as a character. 
 
Luffy is hands down the worst Shounen protagonist of all time. Luffy has no character development. None whatsoever. He has no internal characterization at all. None. Any chance he had at character development was ruined because he just ends up going back to how he previously was. If an anime/manga is over 800 chapters/episodes long and the main character  doesn't have the abiltiy to reflect on his actions, then that's an absolute problem for the story. To be honest, there's nothing interesting about Luffy. He's just the basic Shounen protagonist that we always see in any Shounen.  
 
There are no good villains in One Piece. The only villain I enjoyed is Crocodile, yet he's just a generic villain anyways. Besides him, every other villain is bad. There are no complex villains in One Piece. None whatsoever!  
 
ANIMATION/ART: 0/10 
 
Do I even need to explain this? One Piece has the WORST animation I've ever seen in ANY anime. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree with this. I've never seen a Shounen with worse artstyle than One Piece. The characters look extremely ugly too, especially in the Whole Cake Island arc. I don't know why Oda loves drawing ugly ass characters. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 1/10 
 
How can I possibly enjoy an anime that has bad characters and a bad plot? The truth is, I cant. It was at least decent until Oda completely destroyed his manga. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because of Zoro 
 
OVERALL: 1/10

    One Piece is superb in MANY ways. The quality of both storyline, and production for this series was leaps and bounds over almost any other. Although I admit the artwork for a long stride of the series was only adequate, the epic storyline full of ambition, unique and enjoyable fight scenes, and a display of some of the most unique and down right amazing characters keeps this Anime at the top of the charts. The depth of the plot really only grows throughout the series, and the fact that you only get more interested as time goes on just goes to show how they've managed to last 408 episodes thus far(with many more to go). Their are two other great aspects to this, and many of my other favorite Anime, that should be touched on. The power-scale of One Piece is by far one of the most balanced and in check I've ever seen. Each character displays his or her own powers or unique abilities/traits without the sense of repetition. The second ""great aspect"" to the series is the party-up fashion the story takes. I personally LOVE when an Anime starts with a main character and as the events unfold they establish connections with others and for one reason or another unite. One Piece IMO has encompassed this in their storyline better than any other Anime. However other examples include Yuu Yuu Hakusho, and Rurouni Kenshin. The only negative thing I have to say about this show is the dubbed version. In Summation, for those of you that don't mind subtitles One Piece is a top notch Anime that shows great fight scenes, in depth characters, and a plot that will keep you marking your calendars for the release date of the next episode.

    The spiritual succesor to Dragon Ball (the original series), One Piece combines unforgettable cartoon visuals with knokout fight scenes and an epic plot Akira Toriyama never aspired to. 
In a fantastic world of vast seas, teenage Monkey D. Luffy-possibly the most cheerfully stubborn shonen anime caracter ever-yearns to raise a crew, become the King of the Pirates, and find One Piece, a legendary lost treasure. 
His special ability is the power to stretch like rubber, used mostly to beat up opponents, his special weakness is that, thanks to the same magic fruit that gave him strechy powers,he can never swim. 
the art gradually growing more detailed as the series gose on. 
The plot is set up like an RPG, as Luffy and his companions sail into a new area, become involved in the local troubles, fight the bad guys, and move on. 
Within this rough formula, however, grand plot threads are laid, 
and with each episode the world of One Piece becomes richer and more glorious: a tall-tale world of sea monsters, faraway kingdoms, cloud island, and superpowered pirates of every shape, size, and description. 
The mood is sheer over the  top  melodrama, every line is weeping, laughing, or shouting said with enough winking humor to be enjoyed by jaded hipsters as well as kids. 
The series is notable for its incredibly bloody and intense fight scenes in wich, however no one ever dies. 
 
I have seen the series two times: in englis,German and Japanese and strongly recomande it !!!

    Considered by some to be the heir to the throne of Dragon Ball in terms of Japanese market penetration, One Piece is certainly a phenomenon. The manga's print run recently outpaced Dragon Ball and the series, at more than 130 episodes, is still going strong. It's easy to see why; One Piece follows a very simple and very successful shonen action formula. It worked in the past for Rurouni Kenshin and Dragon Ball and it's working wonderfully for One Piece. The premise is pretty basic. Luffy D. Monkey, an irrepressible youth, ate the Devil's Fruit, which gave his body extra-strength elasticity. He's searching for the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will make him the King of all Pirates and finally allow him to prove himself to his childhood idol, a selfless pirate by the name of Shanks. Along the way, he collects an army of somewhat freakish rogues, including a tough swordfighter named Zoro who fights with a sword in his mouth, and Nami, a spunky thief. Together they have wacky adventures, beat up the bad guys, and collect treasure. It all sounds pretty harmless, right? 
 
Well, right, it is. One Piece is completely harmless entertainment. The battles can be surprisingly brutal at times, but overall, this is pure shonen action entertainment. It is entirely unpretentious and knows exactly what it wants to be, and excels at that. That having been said, One Piece is not a particularly deep show, although the characters are well developed. The focus seems to be on the crazy villains and the endless string of fights the main characters go through. Luffy and his crew of misfits go from town to town, saving the repressed masses and eliminating evil pirates who stand between them and the One Piece. In some ways, it's very reminiscent of Rurouni Kenshin. Kenshin and Luffy are both laid-back badasses with hearts of gold that surround themselves with surprisingly capable outcasts and defeat circus freak-style enemies in episode after episode. If you like that sort of thing, One Piece delivers. If you don't, One Piece is going to bore the faith out of you. 
 
So, for fans of formulaic action shows, One Piece is a well-animated bit of fluff that sports decent music and some well-done action scenes. Unfortunately, the bizarre character designs are sure to turn a lot of folks off. One Piece is not done in a traditional anime style. It's very unique and it's bound to rub some people the wrong way. Otherwise, if you like your anime rife with fight scenes that last several episodes, declaratory statements (“Ore wa Kaizokuo ni naru da!” or “I will become the Pirate King!” is Luffy's favorite thing to say...), screwball humor and a touch of originality, One Piece will not fail to please.

    Instead of giving the anime a ten simply because it's One Piece, let's take a step back and look at this anime from an objective stand point. 
 
The characters and the story is amazing and the manga is probably one of my favorites, but wow. Those are the only redeeming qualities about it and all of it comes from the mangaka. 
 
Let's start with the things that make this adaption garbage compared to the manga that cannot be argued.  
 
The pacing. I have no idea when it was, but at about the middle of the pre-timeskip, Toei decided it was a good idea to adapt a chapter an episode leaving some arcs almost completely unwatchable - full of scenes that drag on continuously and fillers that weren't originally in the manga. This is most apparent during the dressrosa arc, which has been a little slow in the manga, but is still pretty good, but is nearly unwatchable because of the pacing issues. 
 
The animation and the art. Do I really have to say anything about this? Anyone who's watched One Piece extensively knows just how garbage it is, but will continue to watch it anyway because it's One Piece (me being one of those people) and that is why Toei will keep doing what they're doing with the anime. http://oen-peice.tumblr.com/ Go through there and tell me that I'm wrong about this. 
 
 
This anime is not a proper adaptation for the manga and the only proper way to experience it is through the manga. It was somewhat good in the beginning, but become nearly unwatchable as you get to the later arcs. 
 
 
There is nothing I can really subjectively complain about except for maybe the lack of death and how subpar the timeskip has been compared to pre-timeskip.

    ""It has 700++ episodes"" 
""This show is for kids"" 
""This show sucks"" 
ETC 
 
*Contains heavy spoiler* 
 
Are what most people who don't watch One Piece would say. This is because they are just simply overwhelmed by the number of episodes. There are also people who claimed to have watch the show but it still sucks, so I asked a simple question what was their impression on Nami's backstory and they were unable to answer which is a solid proof that they didn't even watch more than 25 episodes. Three years ago, I was a hater of this series but after I saw the manga sales list, I was surprised to see that the manga sale is so overwhelming so I decided to start watching it and now I am here. 
 
 
One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy and his companions, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky and Brook travelling the whole world in order to achieve their own dreams. 
 
Story 10/10 
 
The story started with an epic entrance. I have never seen any character enter the scene which such way. At first, it made people think that Coby was the main character because he was heavily focused on, but once Coby discovered a barrel, Luffy just suddenly came out of it while shouting ""that was a nice nap!"", I was stunned because it was hilarious yet a brilliant way for a character to make an appearance. 
 
At first, I thought it might just be a simple adventure, but it managed to capture my attention because different island had different uniqueness! 
Oda is very creative! It's fun to see they are travelling around, discovering mysteries. 
 
Talking about mysteries, One Piece has this ""Void Century"" mysteries which is that 800 years ago, there were a period of 100 years where there were simply no record and the government stopped people from finding the full history. They would go to the point of eliminating every single innocent citizen just because of knowing this history. The only for someone to know the Void Century, one must know how to read Poneglyph. Robin was the last person to be able to read the Poneglyph and she was being chased for 20 years ever since she was an eight year old girl. 
 
One Piece consisted many tearjerking moments. E.g Bellemere's death, Doctor Hiluluk's death, story about Montblanc Cricket, Going Merry's final moment, Ace's death, Whitebeard's death, Corazon's death. 
 
Animation 1/10 
 
Toei is lazy as fuck 
 
Sound 10/10 
 
I don't really care about sound but One Piece has some good OSTs. 
 
Character 10/10 
 
-Character development- 
 
The first character development started with Coby. He was a coward, but after he saw Luffy's determination, Coby fought his own cowardice and tried to achieve his own dream. 
 
The second character development was Zoro. He was not afraid of dying when he faced off the world's strongest swordsman. Zoro later acknowledged that he was a weakling thus he strove on becoming stronger. 
 
The third character development was Usopp. Despite he he himself knew that Kaya knew he was lying, he still lied to Kaya in order for her to relieve her boredom due to Kaya's condition that she couldn't live her life freely, Usopp started lying because of his late mother. He tried to cheer his mother by shouting ""pirates are coming"" because his dad, Yassop was a pirate. 
 
The fourth character development was Nami. It was revealed that her past was so sad. When she was ten, her step mother, Bellemere, was murdered right in front of her eyes. It was due to that Bellemere didn't have any money to pay to the pirates who invaded their hometown. Bellemere, despite having the chance to just say she lived alone in the house, chose to admit that she had daughter because of her believe that she would never say she didn't have a family. This showed that Bellemere rather die than to disowned her stepdaughters. The story didn't end there, Nami, being a genius girl who was able to draw a perfect map despite being a ten year old girl was forced to work for the pirate that killed her mother figure. The pirate wanted her talent. They made a deal that if she can pay him 1 million Beli (1 million Yen = 8135 USD) they would leave the village. For eight years, Nami stored up to 700 K like Arlong's slave. But Arlong betrayed her. 
 
I can go on but these are some proofs to show that One Piece does have lots of character developments. 
 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
 
With a good and entertaining storyline, of course the enjoyment will be there. 
 
Overall 10/10

    Story 
 
For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. 
Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. 
Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. 
This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? 
The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. 
With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. 
With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. 
 
 
Animation 
 
Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. 
The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. 
Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. 
 
 
Music 
 
Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. 
Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). 
 
 
Characters 
 
Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. 
The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). 
However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. 
Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. 
My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. 
 
 
Overall 
 
Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time whereOne Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. 
However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.

    Story: 
 
The story is awesome, the best ever made probably. 
Eiichiro Oda (the mangaka) is a genius of all geniuses, he come up with all this awesome stuff and make an amazing story! 
 
Art: 
 
The animation is not very good to begin with, but it is become better afterwards. 
But what could you expect, the first episodes is old!  
But the animation now is amazing, especielly if you use Vegapunks HD HQ version! 
 
Sound: 
 
One Piece have an amazing soundtrack that is working out very nicely with whats happening at the moment it is played. One of the best OST ever if you ask me. 
 
Character: 
 
Can't come up with another show with so good characters as there is in One Piece. They're all amazing, funny and you kind of get to know them yourself. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
The enjoyment is on top everytime you watch a One Piece episode. 
You're sitting there, watching amazing fights, funny crazyness (mostly by Luffy, Usopp and a little from Chopper). You see very good friendship and some touching scenes. On top of this you got amazing animation, soundtrack and the best story ever made. 
 
Overall: 
 
Really don't know what to write here, other than that this show is the best ever made in my opinion. If you think it is a bit too long you should just try some episodes or one of the movies, after that you can't go back and you end up watching all the episodes! Have fun! ;)

    At first I was a bit skeptical to watch this but once I got more and more into the story I just couldn't stop watching. Sure there is a ton of episodes but I find it well worth it to watch it all. The concept behind the whole story is very emotional. I felt every possible emotion the characters portrayed in One Piece. I even laughed so hard and shed a few tears. If One Piece doesn't want to make you go out become a pirate yourself or simply follow your dreams no matter what, then I don't know what will!

    Well I thought it was a good idea for me to wright a review for my favorite anime and seeing as how I am a major fan of it I might over rate it but I will try to control this. :D 
 
Story: The story is about a boy named Monkey D Luffy he wants to become the greatest pirate and claim the title King of The Pirates. Now I will be honist here the first couple of episodes are not nearly as good as they are now, but hey he gets better soon. The story dosent pick up till Luffy gets four other crew members and the Fifth story arc (they are short atfirst). The fifth story is what made me love Op it has everything a person could want, humor, action, plot, emotion. Then after this point in the series it just gets better and is why it is one of the top anime/manga\'s of this day and age. 
 
Animation: The animation is a little differnt. I guess you could say it kinda looks like its a cartoon/anime and the characters can look kinda goofy sometimes but it does fit the setting of the show. I gave it a 8 even though I love how it looks. 
 
Sound: OMG some of the best music ever it is amazing. The sound tracks to OP is outstanding, that is the only way to describe it. (why they took it out of the english version and replaced it with rap still makes me wonder) 
 
Enjoyment: There is only a few other things that I enjoy more that watching OP. Including every above plus it has very good movies and fillers. I will actualy watch One Piece\'s fillers and enjoy them, thats how good they are. 
 
Overall: I would say check out this anime no matter what.

    As Hayao Miyazaki said, ""characters who never change are not interesting."" 
 
One Piece since the beginning of the timeskip has been a good example of that. 
 
For a while it was a flawed but phenomenal adventure that delighted partially by being unpredictable, while building dramatic momentum, the bonds of friendship, crafting a beautiful paradox of dark and goofy in its universe and making it credible enough that a five -year old minded spoiled brat would be capable of becoming the king of the high seas. 
 
Luffy is kind of the Tom Cruise of anime characters.  He is small but he seems bigger because he is capable of specatular stunts, he has a trememnous s**t eating grin which was cute (for a while) and he is a little naive. And he has a great crew. They are the kind of characters you fall in love with, but falling in love is always a superficial experience. When you stand back you realize that they are all stereotypes;  the coward, the alcoholic, the womanizer, the hunk, the perverted grandpa. The only character that resembles a real human being is Robin, who is so silently compelling that she should have been the start of the series. 
 
The crew go their separate ways for two years after about 500 episodes. Luffy hides away on an Island to train with a sensei in the art of Haki,  much like Luke learns the force from yoda.  Unfortunately he gains all of the action figure benefits of the training but none of the wisdom. 
 
Right from the moment Luffy reunites with his crew, not as a commanding captain, but like a little brother who is seeing his older brothers and sisters, the ship called ONE PIECE was sinking. 
 
The universe has gotten too big for Luffy to NOT grow up.  His immature tendencies are no longer entertaining. Rather than make him a character, Oda is content to leave him as a formula: he is tacky during funny scenes and aggressive and supposedly sincere during action scenes.  That sincerity feels phoney now, simply because it is not in the nature of the person that Luffy is.  It is as phoney as Donald Trump's ridiculous promises to America, painting an illusion of a utopia.   
 
A show about a candidate for a pirate king needs a strong character for a protagonist, not a sketch of a kid. Now this wouldn't be a problem if the show were purely comedy, but no it also want to be a heavy drama at times too, and Oda's ambitions have gone beyond his ability to write them well.  As a drama, The tonal shifts are so inconsistent. Sometimes it is played as farce, and sometimes it is played more sincerely.  More often than not though, the darker subplots involving themes like genocide are done very two dimensionally, and they tend to serve messages that are very glib and lead to backwards minded sequences. Robin (for example) is an adult from a dramatic  world who becomes a disney-derivative damsel in distress at one point, and her prince charming are kids from a comedic one.   
 
This is just one of many examples of Oda destroying the integrity of his characters by being too condescending of them.  He makes the mistake of thinking that in order to make a character sympathetic he has to make them seem childlike in innocence. such is the case with characters like Luffy's brother Ace, who goes from a bad ass to a crybaby.  Indeed some of Oda's philosophy is a complete insult to our intelligence, No subtly at all, and the emotional scenes are always breastfed to us. 
 
The Devil fruit concept was cute at first, but now it's just silly, like an idea stolen from a video game. There are too many fruits, yielding too many powers and likewise, there are too many characters in the universe. Some of them, in fact most of them have become far more interesting than Luffy, and his pals at this point.  Since the timeskip, the Strawhat pirates have become increasingly less compelling and intimidating, and are now a bunch of pansies in silly costumes. We don't really see an increase in their straight because the antagonists are always two steps ahead of them in strength, when they should be more like 1 step ahead. As a result the fights all feel like recycled sequences. 
 
One Piece is a show that has gone on too long and yet disputed the distance we have travelled, it feels like we have gone nowhere.

    Skip it:  
 
The show is extremely overrated & overhyped. Then why is it praised? Well It has a cool starting concept. The story focuses on the world of pirates centering around one man, Monkey D. Luffy, & his journey to become King of all pirates. The former Pirate King, Gol D. Roger before executed publicly by the world government told everyone the greatest treasure the, “One Piece”, is in blue sea for grabs. This ignited the great age of pirates who fought to find it.  
 
The series is divided into arcs, each featuring its stories, islands, which Luffy and company visit for a ""different"" adventure to take place. In reality, it's the same circumstances happening as nothing significant happens to any character, finding the one piece, or to the goal of Luffy becoming pirate king.  
 
Interestingly enough, Luffy & crew do not behave like pirates. In fact, they are helpful, compassionate, & considerate everywhere they go. They seem to behave more like the police if anything. So, why do they want to be associated as criminals if they do not act like it?  
 
The crew doesn't have significant growth. People die & shortly after they all go back into their programed selves. If the goal is for Luffy to become pirate king why isn’t he somewhat close by episode 700? A king should be rational, level headed, tactful, responsible, smart, etc. Luffy is not close to anything. I’ll say he’s emotionally charismatic, strong, & kind, but that is not enough to become a ruler over deranged pirate criminals. 
 
The art for this show is one of the worst showcased. The leads occasionally look decent. However, others are designed hideous. It was painful to observe. Although, the art looked OK in earlier seasons the more it progressed the more nightmarish it got.  
 
There is constant repetition. What I mean is in episodes 293 to 300 it’ll be the same location, dialogue, & situation as from episode 180 to 199. Why are they in the same place with familiar shots? How is this exciting?  
 
The writing is passable for a few melodramatic moments and the sense of humor is sometimes above average. However, overall its a boring program. Whenever Luffy & crew hit a “new” place its the same as before: 
 
1) Luffy and company visit an unknown land. 
2) Meet locals.  
3) Help take out problem(s).  
4) Get praised/&/or new crew mate. 
5) Leave. 
6) Repeat.  
 
Maybe this wouldn’t be a big issue if characters were progressing, the art was pretty, or there was a progression towards the shows conclusion. Sadly, none of it happens so you're left reminded of the boredom & predictability of this tiresome show.  
 
In earlier seasons the backgrounds for characters was done well. However, it goes nowhere so whats the use? The characters don't grow and remain the same. It becomes insulting as you realize the creator constantly manipulates you with sob tactics to make you care. If you took away sad pasts the characters would be nothing. You don't need a sob story to make great characters. You need relatable & inspiring figures who makes mistakes, reflect, grow, & change. Yet that doesn't happen in One piece. 
 
1 : Luffy, remains a moronic, reckless, ignorant idiot who never reflects on anything. Where is the mental maturity? 
2 : Nami, remains a typical basic shonen girl. After her past we never see her working on her goals. It's all brushed away for her to be a cheerleader.  
3 : Zoro, remains an edge lord but at least he still worked at his goal. The only salvageable one. 
4 : Sanji, remains a womanizer who hardly ever discusses his dreams gets beaten, & used for gags. 
5 : Usopp, remains a coward who does off screen training to get muscles. Where is the mental maturity?  
6 : Robin, after her past is legit in the background and used for nothing.  
7 : Franky, fixes ship problems. A plot device to avoid conflicts.  
8 : Chopper, heals team to avoid conflicts.   
 
Luffy is not the worst protagonist but he is wasted. Luffy could have been an educated man by now showing off maturity and growth throughout his adventures. Instead, he is more childish and naïve than ever. One Piece should feel like we’re exploring an ocean, but it feels more like a garden lake.

    Where to begin!?  
One Piece is a very adventurous story. Never in one place for too long the story is full fun and unusual things. 
One Piece is about a rather childish 17 year old boy (Monkey D. Luffy) who aspires to reach his dreams of becoming Pirate King and keeping the promises he's made.  Meeting many a friend along the way the story progresses through many story arcs that build the personality and integrity of each character. 
The first friend and crew member he makes is his ever faithful First Mate (Zoro) who also has a dream to achieve. 
I am not going to explain every character. That would take too long and it would spoil some of the fun. The best way to understand this anime is to watch it. 
One Piece is a really good story, perfect for anyone who likes pirate stories. Though a very long and yet unfinished story thus far, I find it to be very enjoyable. The comedy is some of the best I have seen in any anime. 
I recommend watching in its original japanese with english subtitles (preferably fan-subbed). The dubbed version by 4kids entertainment is TERRIBLE! They have also stopped dubbing it anyway. Funimation has taken over dubbing One Piece in English and has done a far better job. 
As far as fansub groups go, I recommend Kaizoku-Fansubs, Vegapunk and Instantz Noob Production. 
Kaizoku-fansubs (K-F)started subbing the series from the beginning and they are still subbing it today with flying colors. They are the way to go for most of the available episodes. The other groups have what goes after the episodes K-F has done so far. 
Good luck finding and downloading without any problems. Torrent is the easiest way to get them. Otherwise you can get them from IRC. 
This is my favorite anime above all so... 
Enjoy the show!

    The premise is simple enough.  The main character seeks to become the pirate king by finding a treasure called One Piece (you wonder where they come up with these English names ..) and starts by assembling a crew.  The pattern then becomes sailing from island to island, finding problematic villains and sending them packing, gathering crew members, and meeting people.  
 
I had high expectations of One Piece.  As one of the most popular and best-selling manga stories in Japan at the time (and still is) and of the shounen genre that I am fond of, I expected nothing less.  So when Kaizoku-fansubs first started releasing good quality fansubs in 2003 (as compared to the HK rips, where calling the subtitles English is generous), I decided to give the series a shot.   
 
I was disappointed. 
 
As I began watching One Piece, it wasn’t as though I didn’t like the series at all.  It was watchable.  Generally enjoyable.  It just failed to meet the expectations I had.  That was probably the problem.   
 
I continued to watch the series on and off, with the early main characters (Luffy and Zoro) growing on me slowly, and Usopp knocking down my interest a bit.  I started warming up to the series during Sanji’s arc.  Finally, Nami’s arc sealed the deal.  For those familiar with her arc, which I still feel is the best of the crew’s back stories, I can say there were multiple, very memorable moments.  The feelings were real.  I cried for the first time while watching this series.  I cared very much for the characters, and for what happened to them.  I went from lukewarm to obsessed about One Piece. 
 
Its been over 5 years since then, and I still consider One Piece to be one of my favorite stories, both the manga and anime adaptations.  I think One Piece achieves something very rare in its genre.  This isn’t something that I felt all along, but as I’ve examined why I continue to love One Piece, it’s a theory that I think helps to explain it.  Shounen series in general place a heavy emphasis on fighting.  It defines the genre.  Of course, there are reasons the characters fight, and those reasons can often result in long expositions and flashbacks (in the middle of fights, unfortunately).  One Piece is no different.  How One Piece is different is that the fighting is truly a means to an end, not because you know it should be, but because it really is (with many other series, the fighting is usually why we’re watching, whatever else the story might say).  Often, the aftermath and outcomes of the fights are far more rewarding and what one looks forward to, rather than the fights themselves.  A subtle difference, but it makes all the difference in setting One Piece apart from most shounen series. 
 
One Piece is at its most heartwarming in the aftermath of the battles, and in exploring its characters.  It is most enjoyable when it focuses on the antics of the characters as they explore the places they go and generally get themselves into situations.  The interactions between the crew members have spawned tons of hilarious exchanges and scenarios, many which are simply priceless.  One Piece’s main characters, the Straw Hat pirates, are molded after common cliches, yet, as with better stories, make those cliches their own and find a way to be quirkier.  The characters, one and all, can be unabashedly silly yet transition convincingly to deadly serious.  No transition is greater than with Luffy, the main character.  Although he appears goofy and simple, his attitude is better described as fun-loving and child-like, with an innate fascination of the world, new things, and exploration.  He isn’t dumb; rather he ignores typical adult concerns and conventions because they just don’t interest him.  Yet we understand what matters to him.  So when those things are threatened, his seriousness is wholly believable, even if it’s in direct contrast with his usual demeanor.  And when he is serious, he can only be described as incredibly cool ^_^  
 
Remarkably, One Piece manages to balance a genuine lightheartedness through its humor and exuberance, with the gravity of the battles and hardships.  That lightheartedness is missing from most shounen series.  Other series have humor but there is joy in One Piece, which is apparently more difficult to create.  Not to say that this necessarily makes a good story, but it is unique and I’ve seldom encountered other shounen series that exude the same fun and silliness, even as it packs on fights, special powers, and bigger and badder enemies.  
 
I should note that One Piece lacks some of what I consider to be vital elements of a good story, most notably character development and growth, and real tension (i.e., death is possible).  I’ll skip the last, since most series aren’t going to kill off their main characters, but I've not missed the other things, yet.  First and foremost, One Piece is a lot of fun.  It's a story that inspires imagination, and a desire to explore and see new things.  It consistently makes me smile.  And while real tension may be lacking, it doesn't lack for touching or heartbreaking storylines.  One Piece is an amazing ride.  Not for everyone, perhaps, but if themes of friendship, dreams, and exploration, wrapped in a fun package not afraid to be silly, with a healthy dash of fighting, appeals to you, what are you waiting for?

    One Piece, is truly one of my favourite Anime and Manga. Although, in the beggining it took me some time to warm up to it. 
 
Story 
The first part of the series begins by introducing each character as they join the main crew. It didn't really seem that interesting to me at first, but since a friend of mine was watching it with me I decided to continue it. After the beggining of the Arabasta Arc I began to love the series more and more after every Arc. The mixture of Action, Adventure, Comedy, Politics are all given in a smooth and enjoyable pace. Also, the story gives the viewers some important messages concerning friendship and how people should not give up on what they believe. 
 
Art 
The art is really good for a long running series, especially after the High Definition enhancement. It might seem pretty different in the beginning after adapting from Oda Eiichiro-san's art from the manga. I'm not saying it's perfect but it truly is interesting. 
 
Sound 
The Openings and Endings used in the show can sometimes become addictive, you might find yourself in the middle of the road humming the new Opening theme (At least I do some times :P). The background music is also fitting for the series adding some new tracks in later episodes but I don't think they're anything special. 
 
Characters 
The one thing that makes One Piece one of the top series are the characters. Each and every one of them has a different personality both funny and serious and all with a tearjerking past. Furthermore, all of them get equal attention and spotlight. 
 
Enjoyment 
As I said before, the more I continue the series the more I enjoy it. It's really continuing on at a good pace, exploring different genres (e.x. The Thriller Bark Arc)  
 
Overall, 
One Piece has been entertaining from every aspect. From it's hilarious comedy to it's Epic battles. If you have time or are interested in watching a long running series (and I'm sure it has a lot more to go) them don't hesitate to begin watching One Piece, you won't regret it!!

    ''I'm Luffy! The Man Who Will Become The Pirate King'' 
 
This is the quote, that sets the main plotline for the series. Along with the name of the title itself. Hearing this and glimpsing at the synopsis, I build up expectations of an amazing journey, coupled with an engaging story driven narrative and good sense of mystery. Unfortunately those expectations were not met with great content to satisfy them. My main motivations for starting this was my desire to understand why is this series so successful in Japan. And I'm afraid to say after I gave the show a shot, I wasn't able to get it, or even see the appeal like I would for others shows that I didn't like. 
 
Let's start with the Characters [3/10]. They might be one of my biggest gripe of the show. I could forgive the semi-episodic narrative of the show and the repetition found in the format of the arcs if the characters kept my interest and made me want to keep watching. It's not that I simply didn't like them, because Luffy the protagonist himself is pretty likeable, and I like Zoro and Robin. But characterization, progression and just the general writing of the characters fails to deliver. Luffy is two dimensional at best. Everything about him feels borrowed from Goku, and not much is exclusive to him. He doesn't have any significant character development for more than 100+ episodes. He has the same track mind, same point of view. Never changing or maturing. Not feeling any more sense of responsibility and not gasping a bigger sense of the world, emphasizing his naivety and immature personality. So he is a static character for a big portion of the show. While static doesn't mean a bad character by default, in the case of Luffy it makes him a bad character. It makes him super predictable in how he reacts to things, his interactions with others and his decisions in general. There is hardly any fleshing out of his character outside of simple dialogue and simple motives ''I want to be the pirate king'' '' I Will Protect my Nakama'' ''I love meat''. His characterization is very simple and while that could be considered likeable, it's yet not charming as Goku. Since it's just a copy. I just find him dull and non-simulating, the shouting and care free personality with the serious personality in fights doesn't make him interesting to me. There is just no particular depth in his characterization or the execution of his character. He is faced with a major life changing events later on in the series, but he is still the same character after it passes. When speaking of development, it's not meant to be a complete change of personality (180 personality change) but it means a significant change in characterization, while his fundamental character is still intact. A dynamic character most often than not is more interesting with more room to show more layers of the character. 
 
The other main characters more or less are the same as Luffy just slightly better. I found Nami's character to be good due to her conflict with pirates and her character development and back story in Arlong park. I thought that was a not so average aspect like most other things, and I even started liking her. But as soon as that arc finished she remains static with nothing to offer, making her interactions with the crew members predictable, annoying and hardly funny. I expected to see more to her than simple gags. They don't get development past their introductory arcs. Which makes them less believable and interesting, considering they are on a big journey that should alter their lives forever. Repeating of their dreams and motives every other time kinda makes them shallow, because they offer nothing else in conflicts, internal struggles or different dimensions or something subtle to make me wonder and try to think and understand something deeper or anything interesting really. They remain in a status quo for a very long time. The author just doesn't try and bring fourth interesting conflicts for them to develop alongside the story. It's like after he is done with their basic and initial characterization he just stops there. So they feel like very incomplete characters that have unharvested potential despite the length of the series. 
 
I really dislike Sanji. He is the worst crew member. No. He is the worst character in the entire show. No. He is the worst character I've ever seen in any shounen anime. There is bad, and there is offensively bad. Sanji belongs to the latter. His characterization, I don't exactly get what the author wanted here. Did he really want him to be a celebration of sexism? it's supposed to be chivalry but it goes beyond that, and enters the realm of sexism with Sanji. When he refuses to fights female characters even if the lives of his crew members depends on it. He is not supposed to be a comic relief character, so this isn't an excuse to how his character is written and presented. I don't see him as a classy womanizer, I see him as an offensive character who's love for women shouldn't be more than a comedic side to him. It shouldn't be a big part of his characterization. It came to the point where his comedic nose bleed became an actual plot point, I shit you not. It's like everything about him aside form his initial dream (that is never brought up as an actual point of relevance after his arc) is about women. And that's why he is that much worse than the other characters in the show. There is nothing redeeming about him (even his style of fighting is bleh) 
 
The story [5/10]. I didn't see something particular impressive about it. There are certain problems that is apparent in almost every arc. They are formulaic for the most part. The crew goes from an island to an island helping the inhabitants of said islands, and go on about their way. It feels like every arc is episodic and discontinued, with little things barely connecting them together to an overarching story. I didn't like that since I like continuity and for a premise such as this, I was more in favor of non-episodic storytelling. As it feels like padding, since you get introduced to a lot of characters that are in the end not important or even relevant outside of their perspective arc for the story or the main characters. Once in a while one of those characters make a surprise appearance and the fans get excited, feels a bit like tricking them from my point of view, especially with the characters that are supposed to be dead but are never shown exactly their death. 
 
The type of stories in each of these arc is more or less fundamentally the same. An evil oppressor (Arlong, Crocodile) does his evil ways in the island and controls it for his own objectives. The heroes (strawhat crews) became friendly and bond with the villagers, so they are asked to help them. Luffy takes on the big bad and the others take care of the henchmen. This type of scenario gets boring pretty fast. Especially when it in itself, without the repetition is dreadful and the bare bones of a hero vs villain narrative. In Alabasta, it almost feels like a Disney story, with the person asking for help being a princess. Villains in the series in general are evilly cartoon-ish. Another issue is the plot armor, and how almost nobody dies. 700 episodes and the death of important characters can be counted in one hand. Nothing wrong with keeping it light, but if that's the the intention then the characters shouldn't be facing that many near death experience and surviving through cartoon logic. It will really test your suspension of disbelief. Luffy for whatever reason almost always has to take the big bad of any arc, which adds to the formulaic nature of the arcs. There no logic behind it aside from Luffy being the protagonist. This negates the potential for more interesting conflicts or the chance for other crew members to get a bigger spotlight. Zoro's spotlight in Thriller Part is a fine example of how Luffy not hogging the spotlight for once was incredibly refreshing and most importantly great on it's own. 
 
The pacing [2/10]. This in particular is one of the biggest issues in the series. That overwhelming amount of episodes isn't like that just because of the great mass of content alone, but the almost snail pacing contributes to that greatly. Toei is the animation studio in charge of this adaption. It became infamous for this type of pacing and production. Intro in the beginning of each episode, recaps, a lot of paused shots, and overall just the mind numbing feeling that nothing of interest is happening for several minutes of an episode. This is definitely the biggest hindrance of enjoyment in the show, at least for me. But it's not all Toei's fault. The original source material also has a slow progression of events. Along with Toei's treatment, this makes for an unsatisfying watching experience. Which is one of the main reasons if not the biggest reason why I dropped the series above all else. Take in mind, that this isn't to say slow pacing is inherently bad, it actually can enhance the experience of certain works. But One Piece is definitely not one of those works. A balance would have been ideal, even if I have preferences for fast pacing in action shows. It's currently according to a lot of people unbearable, so it only gets worse. 
 
The action component of the series is, in my opinion just awful [3/10]. I personally consider the fights in One Piece to be the worst I've seen in any action shounen I've watched. Be it in terms of creativity, strategy, abilities/powers, excitement or animation. The abilities/powers are silly, while that works with the general style of the show, its still lacks creativity, as they feel like they are created by a child. A rubber man. Someone that can make anything into a door. Feet that generate fire from the passion of the heart, etc. I will get to the animation in it's own paragraph. The fights are sometimes really dumb, and are mostly devoid of strategy. The best you can get in terms of strategy, is juvenile tricks by Ussopp, and the silly 'tactics' Luffy comes up with, that shouldn't work but they do because of Luck or/and the incompetence of the villains (the classic trite of you are beneath me so I didn't take you seriously and was careless) . Shouting and straight forward predictable fighting, is what you will get. The tension created by how is this character going to best this character is simply not there. When Zoro gets beaten up badly by someone made of steel, but suddenly has the resolve and wants to believe he can cut steel, and he just does with no good explanations, you will know that you shouldn't expected anything smart out of the fights. In fact some are offensively dumb, Bon clay vs Sanji comes to mind. There is also how the comedy is inserted in some fights or certain scenes. I realize that show has a lot of comedy, and it's a prominent genre, but that doesn't mean it should be inserted whatever. With disregard of the current tone and atmosphere of the scene, a particular scene in thriller park had that. It undermines the importance of the fights sometimes and the mood that is being set, and it in itself is rarely funny. The humor in general is not great. As it's very repetitive and most often dry. How many times until Nami, yelling at the crew and showing her greed becomes just plain unfunny. Though maybe if you really like any particular gag, you will still like seeing it again and again (Zoro's bad sense of direction for example). So it depends on the individual's sense of humor. It wasn't until Alabasta that I found an episode to have legitimately funny scenes, so I came across more misses than hits. 
 
The Art and Animation, and OST [5/10]. I will be frank, I didn't really take much notice to the soundtrack so I can't comment on it. The artstyle of the series is often described as ''ugly'' by those who refuse or avoid to watch it. And I can't say that I blame them. Is the art different compared to similar shows? Yes. Does that automatically makes it better or good? not necessarily. The art is influenced by western cartoons and Disney. And it's fair point for those that think it's works well with the series, and I agree to a certain extent. But that still doesn't mean me or others will like it, as it's still very unappealing. It also has an apparent effect on the emotional scenes in the show. The facial expressions are so exaggerated that it disengaged me from whatever emotional scene I was watching. With big rainy eyes, and noses full of snot. It completely lacks subtlety. Bigger doesn't always mean better. It comes off as the show trying hard to emphasize just how sad what you are watching is. It can be ineffective and worse, counterproductive, when instead of feeling sorry and emotionally involved you feel like laughing because of the ridiculous faces. 
 
While I understand this is a long running anime therefore expecting fluid animation is unfair. It still should mean that at least once in a while you will be presented with good to great animation in important scenes and fights. Like with other long running battle anime. This unfortunately is not the case here. At times it feels like a slideshow. Barely any nice visual effects. Lot of pauses and staring. Still shots. No good Sakuga. And it only gets worse currently according to the fans. 
 
The Worldbuilding [5/10]. I left this at the last, because from my general understanding this is the most praised thing about the show. But why? from my point of view, there is nothing impressive about a city in the dessert or an island in the clouds/sky. Once again the creativity of the author seems child like. But maybe that's the appeal. The feeling of freedom, and childish imaginative without the shackles of reality. But it still doesn't necessarily make it great. It feels like it's praised because he created a vast world that is still expanding because why wouldn't he expand it, when the estimation for the number of chapters is beyond 1000. But then again, worldbuilding wasn't something that I cared for in general, in my favorite shows, or any work of fiction for that matter. I could appreciate well done aesthetics of a beautiful world, that you like to take a mental picture of. That's not the case here, so I can't really credit it. 
 
Ultimately, I truly and honestly wanted to like this. So the gigantic amount of episodes/chapters would become an advantage. I wanted to be immersed in a story and keep following it for years. But the series failed me, after giving it a fair enough chance. I stomached through the beginning since they said Arlong park where it will get good. I endured after that, when they said Skypiea is fun and worth it. I couldn't keep on hoping, when they said it's Water 7 this time, more than 200 episodes. I just gave up. There wasn't any pay off. Everything was standard average to below average, with few exceptions. Not special or distinctive to dislike or for this to become more than a disappointment. My enjoyment being hindered with the pacing, and lack of stimulating characters, I made the natural choice of dropping it. I just couldn't take another minute felt like I will just die from boredom. 
 
TL:DR- If you are hesitant whether or not to make this big time commitment, you should keep in mind that it's generally agreed upon by fans and haters alike that it doesn't get better until Arlong park, which more than 30 episodes into the anime. I would recommend this, if you are looking for a happy go lucky battle shounen, that has a lot of focus on the adventure. I don't recommend this, if you are looking for a continuous narrative of a complex story about finding a treasure, with interesting unique characters. Nothing of value is lost, or something worth the commitment if you are avoiding this.

    Story: 
So let's start with something we can all agree on- visually and conceptually, One Piece is a unique series. Anime is littered with ghost hunters, ninjas and teenagers endowed with mystical powers inspired Eastern mythology, but Oda hit on something special when he came up with the idea of 17th century pirates with superpowers. And that's really the beginning of One Piece's creativity. For such a long series, a constant flow of creativity is a must, and Oda has generally shown that he is up to the challenge. One of the conceits of the series is that each island the characters travel to is a strange world unto itself. One island could be under the thumb of tyrannical mermen, another a mystical island where it always snows, and still another where all the plants and animals have grown to be really l o n g. It's wonderful world building, but not in the sense that it's carefully crafted like Fullmetal Alchemist. It's more like a child's glee at making things up as she goes along. Unlike most shounen series, where superpowers and wonders have some kind of pseudoscientific explanation, the series follows an unrelenting dream logic that it doesn't explore very deeply. Why does eating a fruit that gives you superpowers also mean you can never swim? It just does, dammit. It's a refreshing change, and it keeps the sense of wonder intact for many episodes. 
 
Luffy is a kid who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, and now is a rubber man: literally, a man made of rubber. That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in One Piece, it's a potent power that leads to some crazy, awesome, and crazy awesome fights. He can take a lot of damage, and since his rubber fists and feet can stretch to huge lengths, he can give as good as he takes. One of the main villains, Buggy, ate the Chop Chop Fruit, so he can divide his body however he pleases. And there are many more, and for over three hundred plus episodes, we are constantly introduced to wave after wave of new characters with strange abilities that range from the silly to the sinister, and, sometimes, are even both at the same time. And one of the small delights of the series is that when our heroes get strong by developing their powers, they break from the shounen formula of ""defeat - training - victory."" No, the characters develop their skills on the fly- they make it up as they go along. This burst of creativity lasts so long and is so strong, that when the anime does finally bring back some old characters beyond the core cast, it's a bit of a disappointment. 
 
Characters: 
Of course, for the series to be any kind of success, the characters would have to be better than your garden variety heroes. They'd have to be characters you could care deeply about and watch develop beyond what crazy things their powers do. Luffy can't become the Pirate King by himself, so he brings along a ragtag group of people he befriends in his travels. Though the small crew keeps adding new characters, there's roughly five core members: Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While you could safely describe each of these characters by whatever their particular kook is- Sanji is the cook who loves the ladies, Nami is the domineering navigator who loves money, Zoro is the samurai swordsman who wields three blades and sleeps all the time, Usopp is the sniper who tells outrageous lies- but that doesn't quite do them justice. They develop and grow close to each other, reinforcing the anime's central theme of friendship. The cast is probably One Piece's greatest strength, because when the story lags and things slow down, it's still a pleasure to spend time with the Straw Hats. I would hold them up to any of the great crews of anime, from Lupin, Urusei Yatsura, or Cowboy Bebop. And save a kind word for the villains: after all, what's a good hero without one or a dozen great enemies? They are all hateful bastards who deserve to get their face smashed in. It's a delight to see it happen every time. 
 
Art: 
Visually One Piece is one of the most unique anime out there; one could say that the look of One Piece is very abstract when compared to most other anime of present in the same genre or any genre. this is mainly due to Eiichiro Oda’s art style crafted in the manga which has a very unique and unusual look when compared to other manga. Some people have even put off watching this show purely based on the look of the show which is a darn shame because they are doing themselves a massive disservice. While One Piece isn’t as detailed as other shōnen anime like Fullmetal Alchemist, Naruto or Bleach, which have highly detailed characters in the facial, hair, and clothing areas, One Piece has is simple in composition but has a lot of artistic flair and creative things that you’d never find in other anime. The characters are very simple, not very detailed and look kind of wacky and funky when compared to other shows. However I feel that the look of One Piece‘s characters, creatures, settings and animation are very interesting and is one of the unique selling points of the show and if you give it time you will adjust and come to love it. 
 
Sound: 
The music for this show is totally incredible, its varied, catchy, epic and has a musical theme for every scenario. Each character has a certain theme that’ll play while they’re fighting or doing something sneaky and the songs work very well. Another great aspect with One Piece‘s soundtrack is that the music evolves along with the show with different themes for new locations, characters or fighting music for new situations and it really shows that the show is changing and it really immerses you in that world too. Eventually you’ll find yourself humming away with some songs, whether they are opening songs or particular tunes in the show’s soundtrack. 
 
Overall Enjoyment: 
I believe that One Piece is the definition of what shōnen-based anime is all about. Now One Piece is a shōnen by genre which normally means that one is dealing with an action/adventure-based cartoon. The codes and conventions found in this anime are similar to other shōnen anime like Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach and Fairy Tail. You have the main protagonist who is a man, accompanied by other main characters who are either friends, allies or enemies. The main cast of protagonists are normally in a group or crew of some kind travelling from place to place of varying look and feel, coming across different obstacles and overcoming them through meeting their problems head-on and fighting their way to victory. And obviously as the journeys continue the obstacles become harder to triumph over. But I believe the way that One Piece does it is just wonderful, subtle and done with a great deal of style that it stands out from any other anime.

    This self proclaimed ""anime"" IS the worst thing to come out of japan since the kamikaze in WW2! 
 
I'll tell you why. 
 
#1 It starts off with a story, and a goal but quickly it forgets these things and goes out of control with endless fillers. 
#2 ENDLESS FILLERS!! it's as if they can't seem to escape from them. 
#3 The art is so horrible i can't stand to look at it, when the main characters smile i almost throw up. 
#4 The sound of luffy's voice is painful, and that is a understatement. 
#5 It's a slap in the face to all REAL pirates fictional or real. 
#6 There milking this show for all the money they can, it's not about the show anymore it's about the money. 
#7 I never hear the end of these 13 year olds asking why the newest episode is not already translated and uploaded the moment the day switches over! 
#8 The 13 year old fans never shut up about how ""awsome"" this show is! 
 
In the end the voice acting makes my ears bleed, the art makes me puke, and the story has been long forgotten during this endless maze of fillers and milking! 
 
I know I will get nothing but flack but at the end of the day this is my opinion I'm not forcing it on you so PLEASE don't try and change my mind on it. i watched 40 episodes JUST to have the right to say ""I tried, i really REALLY tried! But I hate it""

    One of the best anime i have ever seen, at points its not as interesting as other anime, but over all it is amazing.  
 
 
One Piece is an anime about pirates and dreams.. but mostly about dreams.  
 
Monkey D Luffy is a character that everyone has to love, he\'s the captain with the strongest dream and love of his crew, but he doesn\'t really act like a captain at all, instead of ordering everyone around, he\'s always just trying to have fun. He loves food, but expecially meat, its supprising how much he can eat. (WATCH THE ANIME!) He can stretch because he is made of rubber and  his dream is to become the Pirate King. 
 
Roronoa Zoro is the firstmate and swordsman, he always carries around his 3 katana and he seems to care more about them than people. He loves his sake and has a good drink when ever possible, but like a true pirate, he never gets drunk. His dream is to become the best swordsman ever. 
 
Usopp is a sharpshooter and total liar. He often calls himself the captain. Can\'t really think of much to say that makes sense if you havnt watched the anime. His dream is to become a true man of the sea. 
 
Nami is the navigator who will suddenly change course for money. She takes control of the ship when Luffy is negleting his job and tells them to get a move on. Without Nami, everyone would be always arguing and they wouldn\'t be going anywhere (until Luffy grew up and started acting like a captain). Her dream is to draw a map of the world. 
 
Sanji is the cook. But watch out if you are a girl because he\'ll soon be running after you. He always runs after girls when he\'s not busy (generally, but he sometimes does when he is..). He cooks the best food around and is always inproving, but he favouratises the girls when he\'s cooking and gives them the nicest things. His dream is to find All Blue, (WATCH THE ANIME!). 
 
Tony Tony Chopper is the doctor, he\'s a reindeer who joins the crew. He can become a human, but he always keeps his blue nose. He\'s a really good doctor and a funny and cute character. (WATCH THE ANIME!) 
 
Finnally, Robin, She\'s an archieologist who used to be their enemy. When Luffy saved her when she just wanted to die and had nothing to live for, she joined the crew. Recently, something strange happened to them (WATCH THE ANIME!). She wants to find the rio poneglyph. (WATCH THE ANIME!) 
 
It is a very long series and no one wants it to end any time soon. It never gets boring and the characters are all perfectly made.

    Okay, this is a LONG series, so it's kinda hard to review it as a whole because I feel completely differently at different points of the series. So I'll break it up into three sections 
 
My overall score is based on the last section though.  
 
First Section [Episodes 1 - 223] 
 
I'd call this a pretty fun anime almost out of the gate. It was really exciting seeing a very unique world, unique premise and interesting characters to wonder about right away. I really enjoyed that a lot of characters were introduced very early on as very powerful people, but we were totally left to wonder about them. This is very essential to getting people excited about what's to come.  
 
As far as the characters go, although they are all pretty one dimensional, they are all very likeable (except for Usopp, I can't stand him). Luffy is kinda hard to hate and there is someone to like for everyone in the series.  
 
The story definitely drags a bit. Lot's of filler and pointless sub-plots that drag on for several episodes, but still pretty enjoyable. The main plot continued to thicken and it definitely was alive enough to keep me watching.  
 
 
Second Section [Episodes 223 - 516] 
 
I'd say this is definitely the best section in the anime. This is essentially the build up to the Whitebeard arc, but not before going to Water Seven and really spicing up the story with new, powerful characters and big character development between Luffy's crewmates.  
 
Water Seven was good, but the chapter after that was a bit dull. Kinda just waiting for what eventually became the Whitebeard arc. Once that started, I was at the edge of my seat watching it all the way through.  It does go on and on and on, but you finally get to see some badass characters fight and Luffy really stepping up in power quite a bit.  
 
Very fun watch, even though some episodes are worth skipping. I very much liked this anime up until this point.  
 
Third Section [Episodes 516 - 677 (ongoing)] 
 
Here is where I really started to fall off. At first it wasn't so bad, but I progressively realized that I wasn't looking forward to anything in this anime, and as soon as I caught up with the release cycle and was watching weekly since about episode 590, I realized that nothing was happening on an episode to episode basis and as it kept going, even less would happen in each episode.  
 
The last 20 episodes has been some of the worst. Every week I watch it for whatever reason, and every week I realize that I would have missed absolutely nothing if the whole episode was turned into a recap clip.  
 
Episodes don't really begin until about 4 minutes and 30 seconds in, and even then, it's essentially rehashing the last 5 minutes of the episode before that. They spend FAR too much screen time with reaction shots, sound effects and a bunch of shit that doesn't matter and very little with progressing the story line. I don't think there has been an episode in a while that would take more than 3-4 sentences to describe literally everything that happened.  
 
[Overall / Story / World] 
 
I do like the premise of the power system in One Piece. It's a pretty simple idea and pretty flexible. You obviously have to dismiss some stuff that simply don't make sense, but you fine with it... at least at the start of the story. Later on though, you quickly realize how unpolished the power system is. You have literally no balance at all. Bad guys will crazy OP powers can seemingly never exhaust their power, but Luffy is tired almost immediately after he starts a long fight. And as they add more concepts into the system, the more you think to yourself, why did we never see this before if everyone can fucking do it?  
 
They are all traveling the grand line, but seemingly every other pirate is waiting just ahead of Luffy waiting for him to catch up. Even with a 2 year gap, pirates haven't progressed at all down the grand line while it only took Luffy 1 year to travel the first half.  
 
The story just starts to break with time and characters are becoming progressively less interesting... However, it could be improve a lot if I didn't feel like I was wasting my time watching each episode because nothing fucking happens. (and yes, I'm including even episode 677. Doesn't justify the previous 20 being about a bunch of nothing).

    Well where do i start ... there is so much to say.. for the super fans of One Piece, i'm going to punish this anime so this review may piss you off.  
 
 
This anime, like any other big shonen, made a crucial mistake that i'm going to explore, besides that, the rest is fine.  
 
Story: 7/10. Well.. it is hard to explain this rate. Is the plot original and creative? Yes it is, but it does not sound nice ! It seems like they started with a decent plot, and then they just keep adding things to make it bigger. I mean, the plot doesn´t need to be 'stupid'. I don´t mind if there is unicorns or mermaids or even islands in the sky but keep adding things will not make the plot better. But this is not the main reason for this rate ..  
 
The story takes to much time to be developed.. I mean we have arcs with 60 eps or even more.. i've seen animes with 24 with more content than these arcs with 60 or more eps ..  the pace is just to damn slow which makes the anime boring at some point.  
 
Plus, we can have one hundred different islands, each one with something different, if the story is always the same, it won´t make us hooked. Because yes it's always the same, we have a bad powerfull guy that took control of the island, and the weak good guys asked for Luffy's help and that's basically the entire anime is all about ... and ofc Luffy will always win. If the plot is always the same thing throughout 700 eps, there is no way for it to be good !  
 
Besides all of those bad points, there is a good point.. the ""Akuma no mi"", those fruits that grants them powers are really nice. We have so many different powers and we always want to know which power the bad guy has. Because we never know, there are so many..  
 
Art: 7/10. The anime starts with a crappy art, but then gets better with the time but never reached great levels ... the action sometimes has no detail. Some special movements or attacks we can´t even see them (especially when is about swordsman .. i mean they use their special movement, but we don´t see him actually using it, we just see the enemy being hit.. and that just sucks). The background is reasonable at least so as the character design.  
 
Sound: 8/10. Nice openings .. all of them portray the happy theme that One Piece talks about (friendship). The OSTs are reasonable enough to make the action and the drama good.  
 
Character: 8/10. For me, the best point here. We have nice characters with a nice development and a nice past (actually when they were telling the past of some character, i nearly cried at some, because they were dramatic enough to make me care a lot.) BUT .. it's like watching the same character every single time. All of them can be resumed to this sentence: ""I care about my friends so i'm going to protect them at any cost"" .. basically they look like this..  
 
About the villians .. we have some nice villians actually .. they make us hate them, so when they get defeated we feel relieved xD but they are also the same shit. The motivations are always the SAME (take control of something, usually the island). So .. we don´t have that variety of characters that we see in other animes .. It's basically the good guys vs the bad guys ..  
 
Enjoyment: 7/10. This anime starts being good as hell, with nice fights and nice development but .. it was good because it was new for me. When i was in the 500th ep or so i was like ""yh yh let's move on to the fights instead i don´t care about your story !!!"" .. and there is even some arcs that were painfull to watch ..  
 
Overall : 6/10.. this anime is just too big .. it has nice characters, nice development and even a interesting plot .. but not for 700 eps .. if you are looking for some nice action anime, or even some nice shonen .. well you can watch this one, at least the first few arcs because those are good but i think it doesn´t worth, if you are like me, when you start something and then you have to end it, well don´t touch in this anime. Because you will get bored.. it's just to damn long. Furthermore, it gets repetitive so i don´t see the point in watching this.

    [Spoiler Warning] 
 
ok. let's start with the art. the art is a 7. it's pretty good art and after a little while you'll get used to how the of all the special abilities look. 
 
Sound is once again a 7 there is nothing really to complain to much about the sound. typical for shounen anime really. dramatic music at dramatic moments happy music happy moments, you know the obvious. it's kind of hard to fuck up sound. 
 
Characters are a 7, they have nice drive. which i think is important for shounen anime cuz they tend to be battle manga and you can't have the characters the weakest cuz they will never fulfill their drams. 
 
Enjoyment is a solid 7. it's always fun to watch the good guys kick the bad guys ass or whoever is in their way for some bullshit reason. plus when you love the characters the enjoyment is also good. 
 
Sadly this is where everything else takes a nosedive into a volcano and incinerates itself. the story and overall are both a 1. now this might not make sense considering how the other parts of the show went but because I'm not a fanboy that orgasms at hearing the name of the show you will get an honest and objective viewpoint. the reason the story is crap is because they have done NOTHING in the goal of making Luffy the pirate king. In my opinion there are big milestones in the story. in order they are 1 Luffy gathering his entire crew. 2 (SPOILER ALERT) the death of his brother Ace. and finally 3 (SPOILER ALERT FROM MANGA) Luffy discovering one of his childhood friends Sabo is alive when believed dead.(END SPOILER) Yes these are good story points but these three segments are they only things related to him being a pirate besides the obvious like him beating strong people and his bounty rising yada yada. but what about him being the pirate king? Nope. About the meaning behind the initial D.? Nope. Oh wait what about the true history of the world written in the Poneglyph's that Nico Robin is looking for? Thats gotta be mentioned more then just a few times and be a serious story arc to help get closer to a proper ending? NOPE. Every time they  have major story points like the 3 I had just now and the others I'm probably forgetting what happens? They mention it a few times in the story make a big deal out of it then sweep it under the rug. the author is just milking the manga for profit at this point and i don't see anything in the story moving farther towards an ending. which is kind of the entire point of watching and or reading the damn thing. you wanna see the entire journey, beginning to END. NOT watch someone earn their fat paycheck. that is why the show is crap. that is why i dropped it.

    One Piece starts great. It has original setting for its time, it introduces the best hook in all shounen anime, important characters are nicely fleshed out, the main character cannot one punch every enemy, and the story doesn’t feel like the original creator has run out of ideas. But this was many years ago. It doesn't look like an anime worth watching in 2017. 
 
Since One Piece was first published in 1997 as a manga, and was animated in 1999, it took decades to tell the story. Its creator Eiichiro Oda had just graduated from high school back in the 1990s. He kept writing the same story well into his middle ages. I grew old watching and reading One Piece. I sometimes wonder how many fans have died waiting for the story to end. Please, if you ever create a story do end it before your youngest readers get their menopause or other age-related changes. Fans aren’t immortals to indulge storytellers. Even Eiichiro Oda is taking more and more breaks to take care of his health. Otherwise he cannot continue the work.  
 
One Piece has one unique element that is hard to find in other long-airing anime. Its story is solid. It has actually two different storylines which Oda skillfully combines into a single plot. The first is the story of Straw Hat Pirates led by Luffy. The second is the history of the world of One Piece. As Straw Hat pirates continue their adventures they also discover the truth about their world.  The pirate king who died decades ago left a great treasure called One Piece which somehow can change the fate of the world. The world government fights against pirates who want to become the next pirate king by finding that incredible treasure. As you can see, the lives of individual characters are more or less related to the world’s history. It makes the story more realistic. More, these two parallel storylines in a single plot make the anime even more interesting when they meet. This double-storyline method makes it possible for the lives of different characters to be intertwined naturally. 
 
In One Piece supporting characters have lives of their own. Every character is also part of the world depicted. They don’t feel like talking heads in the void. Their lives are not isolated from each other. 
 
Because the history of the world is so vast, there’s always something going on behind the stage. Actions of important people belonging to the world of One Piece have crucial importance. They can change the fate of the world. Furthermore, the aftermath of crucial battles does have repercussions for others as well. By careful storytelling Eiichiro Oda succeeds in preventing the main character from becoming an undisputed god in power. Another feature of this method is that there is actually more organic tragedy in One Piece. 
Overall, One Piece stands out for its original storytelling for shounen, but sadly, like all long-lasting stories, it got old. Its creator got old. Its fans got old. The world got old.

    One Piece is definitely a must-watch anime series if anyone is looking for an amazing series with tons of character development, an intricate and engrossing story, very emotional moments, character companionship,  some amazing fight scenes, as well as a lot of comedic moments.  This anime has been in the top 10 in Japan for a long time, and for good reason.  Right from the get go, the anime introduces you to Monkey D. Luffy, our protagonist of the anime, as well as a few more of his crew that will be sailing the Grand Line with him.   
 
Each character that ultimately ends up joining the Strawhat pirates all have a big dream that they want to follow, and usually, that is the reason as to why they join to crew.  It's amazing to see how everyone's dream is tied together and Oda has woven it almost flawlessly.  Each character also has their strengths and weaknesses which come into play throughout the entire anime.   
 
If you haven't tried One Piece, I urge you to give this show a try.  If you're not used to its animation, please, don't let that be the sole reason that you don't watch this show.  In time, you'll grow to love the animation, and as the series goes on, the animation just gets better and more crisper than before.

    Oh, I can  tell I am getting my full of Battle Shounens for the day. And maybe for the week. So it's time to put away revisiting Hitman Reborn for a while and review an anime I watched recently. 
 
One Piece...oh boy. This is a difficult one to review. So let me just say this outright. There are two ways to review something. One, you compare it with its peers and see how it stands. And the other you test it on it's own merits. And you are probably going to say, ""Oh test it on it's own merits that is good!"" Well, I tend to do the former because that is the more Capitalistic of the two. Comparing it with it's peers to see whether or not you should take your time and money elsewhere. And in the end, the former fits more with the dictionary definition of a consumer review. 
 
And here's the ""but"". But One Piece's peers are all Battle Shounens, and One Piece is an Action Adventure (Shounen is implied here because  Action Adventure is usually aimed at a younger audience). Now, One Piece is an Action Adventure who is competing with other Battle Shounens...so you see my predicament. How can I compare something to other things outside of its genre? It just doesn't work. And that is just not plain fair.  
 
But I must compare it to it's peers because it is competing with Naruto, and Bleach, and even smaller ones like Medaka Box, and the aforementioned Hitman Reborn. I must also do this because I have not seen any Action Adventure animes, and I can't compare it to stuff I haven't seen! So, I must grade it as if it were a Battle Shounen. 
 
Story:  
 
Usually Battle Shounens have bad stories, but this one takes the cake. This is the vaguest plot I have ever seen. And that is because there is no plot. There is no structure. You can look at Naruto and say that there is an overall plot and story line that adds up when you add in all of the arcs. But One Piece doesn't have that. The only plot that is in the show is when the characters are arrive at a new Island. Story: 1/10 
 
Characters: 
 
Now before you stop reading this review and hit the ""Not Helpful"" button out of rage. Or God-forbid begin hate commenting on my profile or even sending me death threats because your favorite animu doesn't have a plot; let me get onto the characters.  
 
The characters in One Piece are surprisingly well written...To an extent. They all have their own goals and their own struggles which make them all grow together as a team. As a character story this anime does fairly well. Most of the arcs are there for the sole purpose of characterizing one of the characters more.  
 
And that is fine, but my question is as follows: Why have none of the characters have had lives outside of seven years old? 
 
Let me explain, whenever a character has a flashback to their past they are always seven years old, or a similar age. What, have they been stuck in the hyperbolic time chamber for their entire lives? I mean seriously all of these characters are in their early to late twenties.... 
 
What? They are in their teens? No way, those ages are arbitrary, there is no way Sanji is nineteen. And Luffy is seventeen. No way, Sanji is obviously in his late twenties. Maybe 28 or 29. But not Nineteen. And Luffy looks like he is 21. Who are they trying to fool? Seriously. And after the timeskip, Sanji looks like he is in his early thirties. I mean, he even has his Italian porno stache going on. 
 
But I am digressing.  
 
I am sure that these characters have had some other life changing conflicts outside of a very young age. I mean, the characters get more substance as they go on, it's just I feel that they could have done their initial characterization differently. Characters: 7/10 
 
Sound: 
 
I have had no problems with the sound, there are no tracks that particularly stood out to me or ones that I just hated. Sound 7/10 
 
Art: 
 
The art is definitely at the beginning of the series a 4/10. But over the years One Piece has gotten with the times and upgraded it's art to a 8/10. So I met it halfway and it is a 6/10.  
 
Length:  
 
This is a special criteria that will be added into the overall score because I feel that this needs to be mentioned. This show is 600+ episodes long. I love my long running series, Dragonball Z and Yu Yu Hakusho come to mind. But those were all 200-300 episodes long. And there is definitely a point where a show gets too long. Yes, Naruto is reaching it's 600th episode as well, if it has not already gotten there (I read the manga). But with Naruto you have the break between the original and Shippuden to break up the monotony.  
 
So, I think that One Piece being as long as it is is detrimental to the series. It makes it intimidating for the newcomers to the series, like me, to get into the show. It's like, ""Well, where do I start?"" And beginning at the beginning is a long and hard road to get through, man. And you can't begin somewhere after the beginning because the characters are consistent in their characterization. It's not like Bleach where events happen and they are never mentioned again. One Piece is consistent to the point where the characters are constantly referring to past events. And after their characters get going, this becomes more frequent later on down the road. The time skip is an example. 
 
So I am going to rate length like this. 10 being the perfect length for the show, like Madoka Magica. And 1 being so long, or so short, that there is no time to tell the story or characterize the characters, think Angel Beats.  
 
So the Length gets a, 4/10. 
 
Fights: 
 
After giving length it's own special criteria in this review. I hesitate to add another special criteria. But since a lot of peopl- fanboys talk about the fights and compare it to Bleach; I feel they would not be justified if I don't put this in here.  
 
For the fights I have not seen with getting as far as I did; I have looked up on YouTube and watched. 
 
So, the fights are short. Like, really short. Most of the fights are below 15 minutes with all of the bull edited out. Bull being talking and scene transitioning to see what all of the other characters are doing for a couple of episodes. And this just does not compare when the same thing is done to other shows like Dragonball Z where if all of the bull is edited, the fights go on for 2:40:37 straight. Don't believe me?  
 
Citation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB45FE6y_wg 
 
So these are the shortest fights, but length shouldn't really matter, shouldn't it? And it wouldn't matter if the fights were sweet. And they are for the most part. I just wish that some fights were longer, like the fight between Luffy and the ""Door Door"" guy with the bull horns. I forget his name. But unfortunately the fight was wasted because the entire point of it was to show off Luffy's new ability.  
 
And that is not to mention that some of the fights completely break my willing suspension of disbelief. Like the fight between Zoro and Kaku. I can't explain this with words. Just here: 
 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6WtrRogy_w 
 
And the joke is that this is supposed to be taken seriously.  
 
I saw a similar post in the comments. And that person was bombarded with One Piece sales figures to try and justify this. But I noticed that in doing so the One Piece fanboys dodged the question: How can anyone take this seriously? I'm sorry, but I can't. Fights: 3/10 
 
Edit: Oops It appears I forgot the enjoyment criteria, forgive me. Please. 
 
Enjoyment:  
 
Personally I don't like Action Adventure shows. 2/10 
 
 
Overall: 
 
I guess I should end this with a miraculous conclusion that summs up everything and wraps it all up with a nice bow to boot. But I don't have the energy. Overall 6/10. Edited with Enjoyment this makes the Overall score 5.8/10 rounded up is a 6/10...wow.

    Yes, you can believe your eyes, I really rated One Piece a 6. 
But please! Wait before spamming the 'Not Helpful' Button. 
 
I'm myself a fan of Shonen Anime, so I should happen to like One Piece, right? Right?! 
Nope, not really. But let's delve a bit deeper. 
 
Story: 6/10 
The definitely most promising about One Piece is its absolutely unique setting. 
The sheer vastness of the world makes this anime outstanding. And even better, in that kind of setting nearly everything can happen. Adventures on the ship, tropical islands, deserts, or some snowy winter paradise. 
However, despite this promising world, each and every damn arc is exactly the same, over and over again!! Our crew gets to island XYZ. Some evil enemy appears and beats up everyone. I mean, look how scary this boss is (more to said boss in character by the way). After being beaten up however, the Nakama get a powerup, and defeat the boss. Repeat. And again. Aaand again. 
 
Art: 6/10 
I won't mention something about the unique Art-Style. Everyone has read up on that one already. Some might like the cartoonisch, and also childish, artworks. I don't BUT I wouldn't cut 4 points for such a reason. So what about those 4 points? Battleanimations. This single word is enough. One Piece has one of the lousiest animations in terms of battle of all time. Repeating scenes, classic cut scenes, everything. Just in the last fight I watched Zoro had a fight, where he parried an attack with his three swords. They change the camera angle, and suddenly Zoro holds only two of his three swords, with the last one being in his Saya. And the sad thing is, this isn't every once in the while, those mistakes are common occurences. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
First of all, the OST/Backgroundmusic. Even though some OSTs were misplaced, the most of the OSTs are pretty good and fit the desired atmosphere. 
Second, the Voice acting: I won't hide the fact, that I like Zoros seiyu Nakai Kazuya. Ever since his first appearence in Gintama, he has been one of my favorites. The other voice actors did their share of work as well, I especially like Luffys, Namis and Choppers voices. 
Last, but not least, the opening and ending section: I'll start with this. Later on, the openings get far too long with 2:30 each. Stick to the common 1:30 damnit! Well, whatever. Most of the openings and endings blend in really well with the overall tune of the show. I don't really like the openings and endings, but they fit, which is the most important point. 
 
Character: 7/10 
Can't really say, that I really like any of the characters (besides Zoro and Nami, but thats just personal oppinion) but they have their reasons of existence. Way worse than the main crew are the completely forgettable enemies. They have puny reasons for being evil, are completely incompetent, and worst of all, some of them even turn face (wrestlingterm: becoming one of the good guys) after being defeated. 
 
Enjoyment: 5/10 
What can I say? Some of the jokes were okay, but serious matters are painfully dump to watch, because the series is just completely unable to stay serious. Also, for a battleshonen, the battles are awfully bad. Well, at least I'm able to crack a wry smile. Every once in a while that is. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
Many think of One Piece as one of the Big Three Battle Shonen, together with Naruto and Bleach. Since I haven't seen Bleach yet, I won't compare those two, but there is no problem with comparing it to Naruto, right? Overall, Naruto wins by a large margin. Its battles are better, the soundtrack is better, the art is more detailed, the series can stay more serious, and whats most important to me: The whole skill system is more complex, but also way superior to One Pieces Devils Fruits etc. An example as ending? Okay: Why for example do Devils Fruits Users not loose their powers in rain? Due to Oda because its moving water. But at the same time they loose their powers in rivers. And strictly speaking: Oceans are moving waters as well. The only unmoving water I can think of are swamps. 
 
If you got questions or feedback, its highly appreciated.

    One Piece is honestly the best show I’ve ever watched in my entire life. What Oda, the creator of OP, gave us, was more than just a story - he gave us an entire world, filled with unique people with their own backstories. It takes the time to tell us about the different characters Luffy meets along the way, and all of their stories are somehow interconnected, whether it’s tragic or happy or strange or mysterious.  It really puts everything in perspective, y’know? That everyone on planet earth has their own story and there’s no end to it. 
 
 
It takes the time to show how its multidimensional characters grow, change, and how it affects the world. Or how it doesn’t affect the world. Like that dog back in Orange Town, who was just trying to protect his late master’s house… tons of instances like that is why I love One Piece. It’ll make you cry, laugh, smile, squeal in excitement, and just be in awe of how well put-together the world of One Piece is. 
 
 
It’s not just all about the characters, though. The overarching plot of One Piece is amazing, as well. In the world ruled by a corrupt government and pirates constantly battling for power, there’s always something new to see, and always something else to affect the plot. The essence of a plot is that it’s formed by hundred and hundreds of character decisions, and you begin to understand the story as you see said decisions being made. You’re shown all of the main character’s goals, and why. You’re shown why villains do what they do, and sometimes you even feel bad for them - like Arlong or Hody Jones, who grew up in hatred of humans from what they’d done to Fishman Island. You’re shown all of the evil of the world, and how it’s always going to be there, and that makes the world of OP that more realistic. You’re shown all of the good of the world, and how some even die in the name of justice, and how some even used to be villains. Everything you see in One Piece just… makes sense. It’s all interwoven - the characters, the backstories, the plot, everything.  
 
 
The wonderful world building, the incredible cast of rich, relatable characters, and the plot that makes you just ache to see the next episode makes watching One Piece through all the way worth it.  
 
 
I will say, this show wasn’t even in my top ten until around episode 100, and not in the top three until around three hundred. The first 20 or so episodes felt like a drag. Many are turned off by One Piece’s art, and others dislike the slow pace. I wasn’t too fond of either at first. Now, I believe One Piece is the best show - no, the best story in general to ever exist. 
 
 
If you haven’t watched One Piece, watch it. Now.

    I always brushed one piece off as a weird looking show with a strange hat boi as an mc. I didn’t decide to give it a try until my friend told me he watched over 500 episodes and never got bored. I decided to give a watch and immediately was hooked in with Luffy’s smile And charisma. 
 
 
At a first glance I’ll admit it, the characters in one piece look really strange. But once you learn of the past and story’s it immediately changes the way you see them and you can see how Oda get better and better at doing this as the series progresses. An example could be Zoro. Zoro seems like a street rat that uses 3 swords for whatever reason but until you learn about how he got stuck bounty hunting and his past with Kuina your perception of him really does change. 
 
 
The world that one piece is set in is one of the stupidest but also the smartest. I say this because there are so many places or islands that have a fully functional Government but when it comes to looks it just goes all over the place but I think this is what keeps me so interested in this world. With every new area you discover it fells like a breath of fresh air from the last place. This really helps you stay hooked and invested in the worlds setting. 
 
 
Overall I would say one piece is one of the best shows I have experienced. From its happy look to its sometimes heartbreaking back stories. This show stays consistently good throughout the majority of the series and kept me flipping pages and watch episode after episode.

    Before I start my review, I would like to say that this is my first review ever on an anime. I’ve reviewed it as fairly as possible with positive and negative points and spoiler-free. If you have any comments, disagree with me, or whatsoever, leave a comment on my profile.  
 
Well on to the review: 
 
''An anime about Pirates? Are you an idiot!?'' That's what I often get to hear. But if you're already reading reviews for One Piece then you’re halfway there. 
 
One Piece is an anime based on the manga of Echira Oda and is part of the ‘’big three’’, which consists of Naruto, One Piece and Bleach. Many people are biased against One Piece, because of the plot. Pirates sounds way too lame compared to other things. I actually thought so too. After a while I decided to give it a shot, and I’m glad that I did. One Piece is one of the few anime that I enjoyed most. Like any other Shonen Jump it has typical Shonen Jump characteristics, like nakama ,etc. Still One Piece is an unique anime and definitely one of the best in its kind.  
 
Story (10/10): 
Like I already mentioned before, many people are prejudiced about One Piece (and start hating it) because of its plot. To be honest, One Piece’s plot is one of the best plot I’ve ever seen. You have a boy named Luffy, who accidently ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi (Rubber Devil Fruit) and gained the powers of rubber. Well, sounds lame right? Wrong! The powers in One Piece are really nice and sometimes actually surprise you. There are a lot of different kinds of devil fruits, which makes the story interesting. The story is divided into arcs (not a lot of fillers, watched them all and enjoyed them all), which all build up the story. It’s really well done. You have some events that happen around episode 80 or something, which lead to another huge event around episode 450. The interesting thing about the One Piece story is that everything is connected. One event leads to another and so on. They aren’t afraid to kill of some people and the story is just simply awesome. One thing that people tend to complain about is One Piece’s pacing. One Piece has been at a steady pacing for a while now (I think 1 chapter/episode), which is the reason why it doesn’t have a lot of fillers. Most of the times this isn’t a problem, but sometimes things do feel stretched out (you won’t notice this if you marathon everything though). Anyway the pacing is in my opinion no problem at all. 
 
Art (8/10): 
One Piece has an unique artstyle. Many people think that it’s ugly, but it’s actually very pretty. The art in the manga is beautiful and I wish that the anime could have adapted the art style better at some points. If it was the manga then the art would be a 10/10, but it isn’t. The One Piece anime has just regular animation, something that you'd expect from a Shonen Jump that has been airing for a while. It’s nothing special, but still decent. Sometimes it does have some awkward animation though.   
 
Sound (9/10): 
Hands down, One Piece has one of the best soundtracks ever. Every soundtrack is simply awesome. It’s just like when you hear one specific soundtrack, you know that shit is going down and that Luffy is going to beat the crap out of someone. I do think that they could have done better at some points of the anime.

One Piece has a lot of characters and to be honest, I love them all. Each character has an unique background, which makes them, uhm, yeah, unique. I admit that some characters are more likeable than other characters (I’m not naming any characters, since I would be spoiling). Sometimes some characters annoy me (doesn’t happen a lot though, happend like 2 times or something?). 
 
Enjoyment (10/10): 
One Piece is one of the animes that I enjoyed most. One Piece feels refreshing and unique, everytime that you watch it. I’ve been following it weekly for some time now, and I’m always looking forward to next week. I don’t know how to put it, but it’s just fun to watch. It’s funny and serious at times when it needs to. Fillers are almost nonexistent and most of the fillers are actually enjoyable (lol, the G-8 arc was awesome). I can just say that I enjoyed One Piece a lot. 
 
Overall (10/10): 
One Piece is without a doubt a masterpiece. Everyone should at least give it a try. Then you can see for yourself how awesome it is (that’s why it's the best sold manga ever). Anyway I can’t guarantee that everyone will like it, but I’m pretty sure that 90% will. You should atleast give it a try. 
 
So what are you waiting for ...?

    After seeing the scores I have given this anime, many people might be confused by my overall score. Don't get me wrong, One Piece is my favorite manga, hands down. The story is wonderful, the characters are great, the art style is unique and colorful.  
 
However, One Piece is a long running shounen manga that is no where near being finished. Usually with these types of series, the anime will add in long filler arcs to allow the manga to put out more material for the main story. Naruto and Bleach are notorious for this and even Fairy Tail had to resort to doing this as well. During its early years, One Piece did this as well, but currently it has resorted to animating one chapter per episode. And this leads to an enormous amount of filler in each episode. Fights are drawn out. Running places takes five episodes. An entire conversation or death scene can take up a full episode. After a while, this sort of thing gets very frustrating, and I have had to put the anime on hold twice now.  
 
Another issue I have with this show is the animation and this also ties in with the filler problem. The animation is very sloppy and its pretty bad when you're watching an episode and notice at least three separate occasions where the same animation is used (I'm pointing fingers at you, Coliseum animation!). The animation will also pan over crowds or go between different characters for 15-30 seconds to fill time, and it could be that no one is actually speaking at all during this.  
 
Honestly, if you're really interested in getting into One Piece, I would recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime. You'll only get frustrated with the filler and animation.  
 
EDIT: As mentioned above, I have dropped this series twice: once in Puck Hazard and once in Dressrosa. I am currently four episodes into the Mink/Zou arc and am probably three episodes away from finally rage quitting this horribly animated adaption of my favorite manga. The filler is unbelievable and the animation is terrible. DO NOT watch this anime past the Timeskip if you are interested in One Piece. Please, for the love of god, just read the manga.

    One Piece is one of the most well known anime/manga and is one of the longest running show ever. It revolves around the Straw-hat Pirates lead by Captain Monkey who strives to become the Pirate King. He is the possession of the Gum Gum Fruit which allows him to stretch his body like rubber. 
The arcs are very good and enjoyable and slowly show the character development. 
The Straw-hats are bunch of very enjoyable and rowdy characters which are very easy to like. Each member has their own goals and unique abilities which help the plot in many ways. 
The show is way too long... but it is a must watch. You will understand the show's amazing story and mysteries only if you have watched the show.  
The anime shows how the Straw-Hats development from being weak pirates to one of the most wanted pirates in the One Piece world. 
The manga has now proceeded to the best arc of One Piece and I strongly suggest to pick up this legendary series.

    One Piece is one of the best battle shounen ever made. 
 
It's honestly not that bold of a claim to make considering that it's currently the most popular shounen series ever, however it's a statement I stand by. 
 
One Piece perfectly captures the key element that makes these types of series enjoyable: being fun. 
 
The series injects this child-like imagination into almost everything it does. A surfer dude cyborg? Why not? A samurai that uses three swords by holding the third in his mouth? Sure! A dude whose super power is stretching his body like rubber? Screw it, make him the main character! 
 
The world of One Piece is colourful, lively, and rewards those that stick through with some incredible moments of world-building. The setting of One Piece has a believably large sense of scale that lends far more weight to story and conflicts that the characters find themselves in, especially as the series goes on. 
 
Of course, One Piece wouldn't be what it is without its central cast of characters; the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
The Straw Hats are a diverse and lovable group of characters that few other series have managed to match in terms of group-chemistry. Every member of the Straw Hats bounce off of each other in hilarious ways that makes them feel alive. Each member has a unique relationship with the other; some are rivals, some look to others for support, and others just love goofing off. What unites all of them is their sense of camaraderie and... of course... *friendship*. 
 
It's also good to emphasize what One Piece honestly isn't. It's not some complex, deep, philosophical epic that you may expect it to be from how much hype the series garners. In some ways One Piece can feel that way for fans, but it's best not to come into the series expecting it to have that level of impact right out of the gate. One Piece is a slow-burn that gradually finds its footing and sucks the viewer in. If action shounen is your thing and you're willing to strap in for a longer series; you'll find yourself rewarded for doing so. 
 
With all of this positivity, there are some negatives as well. If you take a look at my anime list you'll see that I dropped the One Piece anime some years ago; and for good reason. Despite my love for this series, and the good memories I have watching it, I will admit that the anime is not all sunshine and roses for its entire duration. One Piece is a VERY long show with its ups and downs, and depending on the person, one of those ""downs"" may be the one that breaks you and causes you to quit the show. Mine came 650~ episodes in, and since then I've chosen to keep up with the manga instead as it takes up less of my time and is more up-to-date with the story than the anime. 
 
The anime's critical flaw is in its pacing, a flaw not unique to One Piece, but one that prevails through most other anime adaptions of ongoing shounen series. There are points in the One Piece anime that are infuriatingly slow-paced, to the degree where it merely feels like the show is there to waste your precious time. There aren't many filler arcs in One Piece like in shows such as Naruto and Bleach, but there is a LOT of episode fluff. Expect constant reaction shots, long recap segments, repeated reuse of flashback scenes, and fights being dragged out by constantly cutting away to other events. For most of its run, One Piece managed to reward viewers who stuck through those slow points with some amazing moments, however after a while those rewarding moments became fewer and fewer, and the overall pacing of the anime slowed further and further. 
 
Of course by skipping the anime you're missing the amazing voice acting and music, which help emotionally elevate scenes far above how they were depicted in the manga. 
 
So you may be asking why I'd give a show that I dropped a 9; and that's simply because for most of my time watching One Piece, it was my favourite thing ever. To be honest it still is. For a show to give me hundreds of episodes of memories and enjoyment is a feat, and I can't discount those HUNDREDS of episodes due to a later chunk that caused me to fall off. I didn't come away cheated or disappointed, in fact my love of One Piece skyrocketed again once I picked up the manga. 
 
This begs the question: would I recommend One Piece to you? It honestly depends on who you are. Do you absolutely love battle shounen? Does the art style appeal to you? Does weekly shounen anime pacing annoy you? Do you have a lot of time on your hands? Are you prepared to start a long-running show that currently has no visible end? 
 
Depending on how you personally answer those questions, the One Piece anime may or may not be for you. Personally I couldn't binge the show now like I could when I watched it in my teens. However that doesn't stop me from fondly remembering my time watching it.

    Some of the things about the story line I don't like is, they make the recaps on the arcs way two long and the flash backs  are place in odd places. Other then that the anime is good. The pace is not to fast or not to slow for me. If it went faster i would feel like they are trying to finish the anime faster and leaving to much important detail out. So if your some one who like the anime's that can end in 24 episodes this is not for you. Yes i get what people think. this anime stated in 1999 and still has a ways to go. I can say that I didn't even start to watch it till back in 2017, but this pace is needed.i tried speed watching the anime and i got all backwards. 
 
The art does change in the anime more then once but that could just be because the art most people like seeing change to. Just for the love of god don't put to much CGI in. one of the movies CGI and that was to much of a change. 
 
The character are great. well most of them are. I get that anime's have to put a lot of big egos on the bad guys and put too much ego on the marines, but they push two much of the i am more powerful then you attitude in that it dose get old. Also the times when a secondary main character dose the this is my problem i got to fix it on my self but let me tell you everything for no reason is also getting old. you see it in a lot of anime's. The main straw-hats crew and the heart crew are some of my favorite because yes the can be both funny and serious at the same time.  
 
I guess the people who would like this is those who don't mind a anime that takes a while for it to end. Also those who are just happy about being able to watch the characters they love is a filler. i'm just happy that i don't have to fine something to watch for half a year.

    Ultimately, what you have to accept when you're considering watching a show like one piece is that it's over 800 episodes long, and still not over. This is a daunting task even for the most skilled of bingers. As much as I love this show, there are somethings I feel that I need to inform you of before I can honestly recommend One Piece to anyone. 
 
There are two very distinct parts of One Piece, and that is a result of the 2yr time-skip that occurs. For the portion of the anime up until the time-skip I would recommend watching every episode (including filler). Practically all of the early filler episodes utilize one piece's comedy and characters to their fullest, and the fillers don't feel like filler; these fillers feels very in-line with the source material. However, after the time-skip this changes, and the fillers become wastes of time. Additionally, you'll want to instantly skip the first 4-5 minutes of every episode in the post time-skip section as that is simply the opening + 3 or 4 minutes of re-cap. 
 
If you do get up-to-date, you will notice a few instances of lack-luster animation, however, this is true of any anime that runs on weekly releases. Luckily, the scenes that really matter still seem to be getting the attention they deserve.  
 
One Piece's biggest problem is that they have purposely slowed the pacing of the anime to give the manga more time. The best solution if you dislike the pacing, but wish to keep enjoying the story, is to simply read the manga.  
 
Ultimately, I can't end a review on one of my favorites on a bad note, so I will end it with this. One Piece's greatest strength is that it's about how its protagonist (Luffy) changes the world. This is unique to many other stories which are generally focused upon how the world or other factors change the protagonist, and is one of the reasons why One Piece is able to continue a connected story over hundreds of episodes.

    I can describe one piece as a complete experience . if you want commedy , drama , mystery , adventure ,politics , a great story about freindship ,a story about dreams (romance down ) , a story about idols and how they affect children , a story about family and the most incredible love in the world (the love of mother ) you will find all of these here .  
for the story i think it's the greatest story the widest one i admire how oda sensei writes all of these characters ,compines all these legends together to make a very wide world like the one of one piece .  
when i taik about characters i'm confused about whom i talk about and whom i let . the different dreams and ideolgy of them . too many characters with too many secrets and you trying to figure these secrets  
i promise you that you will laugh a lot cry alot get on your nerves a lot and you will have the greatest joy. 
may be the only disadvantege is the slow rhythm . 
i conclude with my of favourites lines of the entire series "" peoples' draems have no end ""

    I've always wondered what my first anime review would be, and it's prob fair that is with the first anime i actually set down and watched, and that anime is One Piece. 
 
So actually i watched about 100 episodes of One Piece in 2015 before droping it for 4 years and i can say is one of the things i regret the most, every year i would try watching again but never would do more then 3 eps, then after watching HunterXHunter i got the will to watch One Piece again and i can tell you for sure is one of the best anime that exist and by far the best shonnen. 
 
So this has been said multiple times but i'll say it again people that deslike/don't watch one piece all say the same things: It's too long, i don't like the art, luffy and usopp are annoying, i've heard even people complaining it doesn't have enough Deaths but that's nonsense, still it's obvious u actually need to take a big effort and time if u wanna watch this show but the trip is just way above any other in terms of long term quality, to me it's pretty clear One Piece was probably always better then other shonens and now most of the big ones have all already ended while One Piece may be going for another huge climax soon on ep 900 and we still have no idea of when is ending.  
 
Now let's just make clear what makes One Piece so great: The Story is amazing, things that happened on ep 90 may get a whole new meaning on ep 300, in One Piece when a new character apear we have no idea who it is, could be a random guy or could be very important later, that beeing said i don't think any anime has the character originality as One Piece does, and it's amazing how after all this time there's still very interesting characters yet to apear or get explored, looking at what people wanna see on watching anime on my opinion One Piece gets almost everything right, the Art style may look a bit different at first but when u get used to it it's impossible not to love, the OST's and Openings are simply Amazing if ur a lover of music in anime and the story like i said it's amazing theres just so many Plot Points is hard to keep track on all of them but unlike other animes they don't start to not make sense or look forced, it seems like in one piece everything ties perfectly and for the enjoyment let's not forget that One Piece is a comedy and while most shonnens also are One Piece is also by far the funniest to me the Thriller Bark and Impel Down are perfect in that for me, probably are the funniest arcs in my opinion and despite that have deeply touching moments in both of them so basically the 2 funniest arcs also had 2 of the most sad scenes in the show and beeing able to do that is what makes One Piece almost perfect for me, and if that's not enough for u there's some of the Best fight scenes in anime, i'll admit that Other shonnens probably have more and ""stylish"" fights then One Piece but then alot of them end up not living to the hype or sometimes feel forced, in One piece this never happens to me all fights and epic moments felt absolutely real and not forced at all specially Luffy's battles that often hold huge stakes for the story itself. That beeing said if u are looking for a long running anime series look no further, One Piece is the best ur gonna get and even if u dont have the time for it.

    Look, One Piece as a franchise is fantastic. Good story, great characters, entertaining fights and a nigh unparalleled world. The problem is that adaptations sometimes don't do justice to the source material, and One Piece is by far the best example of this.  
 
I started watching the anime about 2 months after finishing the manga, and after forcing myself through 40 episodes of terribly paced, poorly animated (even for the time) slop I had to quit. Once when I watched it late at night I literally fell asleep because so little happened in each episode, EVEN after skipping the mandatory 5 minute recap on top of the intro and outro (only just over half of each episode is actually new content.) 
 
Even this content which should be enjoyable is ruined by egregiously long pauses, shots of character reactions, flashbacks and anything Toei animation can do to save a buck, because they know that however badly they treat the anime it'll still be one of the most popular in the world thanks to the franchises overwhelming popularity. 
 
TL;DR : Toei Animation ruined what should've been an easy 8/10 + series, just read the manga because that's actually good

    It was the art that prevented me from starting this anime, however, I'm so glad I got over that. I actually really enjoy unique style now. 
 
 
This anime is definitely action-based as opposed to character based. However, I love the characters, my favorite being Luffy and then Zoro. Though it isn't focused on developing the characters, the characters are one of the reasons I really enjoy this anime ( I still re-watch it). I love Luffy's determination, as well as how he is not the stereotypical calm, cool, collected pirate captain. The way he surprises other characters is very enjoyable to me. 
 
Another reason why I love the anime is the intense devotion the Strawhat Pirates share with each other. 
 
Though sometimes the plot is predictable - Luffy meets strong character, he has to fight, then eventually (after struggling) he wins - I still love it. Once you get past the first several episodes, it becomes addictive. (For me it was actually around episode 32 that I watched it straight through!!!). 
 
All in All, this, HunterxHunter (2011), Naruto / Naruto Shippuden, are my favorite animes, and always will be!

    I really love this series :D I managed to watch up to the latest episode (right now) which is ep 509 in 2 weeks during the holidays -__- craaaazy. 
The characters are great, luffys body develops muscles as the story proceeds, its really interesting but a shame only 1 ep airs every week ): 
 
OVERALL its a great story line, full of adventures, not so serious like Naruto (love naruto too :D but one piece is funnier, and the characters are bright) tadaa 
 
Sorry first time reviewing.. forgot what i had to write in it but YEAH watch watch watch :) recommended for all yous that love animes with an actual story line not just romance and suchh, however there are many eps so.. -__- well i managed 509 in a week and a half so GOODLUCK BOO :D

    Before I started watching it I never considered once this series would become such a big part of my life, not just mine but my friends and siblings also. It's a fantastic show to have a matron through, granted it has a slow start but you'll soon get into it after a couple of episodes, and once you do I can assure you you're going to kiss your social life good bye! 
Don't let the odd art style or ridiculous number of episodes deter you from watching this masterpiece. There will never be a boring moment. It has a truly amazing cast of characters that you will come to love as you learn about their stories and watch them grow. One Piece is a fantastic adventure with epic fight scenes, imaginative characters, wild landscapes, and unforgettable music. You will laugh, cry, feel anger, sadness, and joy as you make your way through the Straw Hats' epic quest. This is the story of Monkey D. Luffy becoming the King of the Pirates.

    I had started watching/reading One Piece in early February of this year and it is an amazing watch. As I had not watched this as a kid, this will not be biased and won't be clouded with 4kids terrible dub or nostalgia. 
 
Story: 9/10 
The story for one piece is very interesting, unique and big. Oda has done an amazing job with providing really great stories across each arc, each with its own feel and style. While at first before the grand line the story might come as underwhelming, it gets alot better. Around Arlong Park is their I personally got hooked watching it. Alot of the arcs is unique when it comes to its plot and is a great journey with the crew. Their is some complaints though. Some events are stretched longer than it should be and rushing in others, but overall the journey and thrill of the story is great. 
 
Art: 7/10 
The art of the show is a hit or miss at times. At times the show looks great considering the length of the series but at times, takes a noticeable hit where their would be low frames, alot of still shots and disproportionated characters. Overall the art is good, but not great.  
 
Sound: 8/10 
If it was purely for the soundtrack of the show itself, this would easily be a 9/10. Each song is unique and fits Into the show and the events that are taking place throughout the show. With orchestra level songs to truly sad piano music to jazzy blues, the music is great, though often repeats itself, is great. However,  the sound effects itself are okay. While their is alot of good sound effects like specific character sound effects to luffys arm stretching, it's quite iconic. Their is alot of sound effects that are quite cringeworthy and too childish for me. Often only have 1 or 2 variations of the sound, Toei would often play the sound effect way too much and be quite annoying. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
The characters in One Piece are great, with a variety of memorable characters, especially in the straw hats crew. Alot often having deep and pronounced back stories and with unique charactistics that are enjoyable to watch. Even the villains, often with interesting motives and personalitys. If I had one gripe with the show/manga, Oda often has a lot of of pretty much unmemorbale, serving little to no actual purpose in the show besides making an event longer than it should be. The Characters are a great aspect of the show. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall Conclison: 9/10 
Overall, the show is great and though the show is quite lengthy and has its faults, the journey and story is amazing and should be enjoyed. I absolutely adored the character development and variety of locations the crew explores and the variety of characters they meet along the way. I recommend the show highly of you give it the time as it's a great show to watch and make you want to watch more alot of times.

    One piece is a show that will put many people off watching it. The art style seems sloppy at first and the show starts off incredibly slow. The first 70 or so episodes have amazing points in them, emotional, heart breaking, absolute epic power of nakama badassery but moves at an incredibly slow pace. 
 
 But. You have to watch this anime because once you get into it you will be hooked. One piece is anime that unlike other anime never gets worse. If you start the show and thinks its good it will only get better.  
 
Each arc has all the support epicness and emotion of the previous arc. This is a show that if you stick to it gets bigger as the scale increases the world expands and the characters grow deeper. The world is huge and this anime deserves to be the king of shounen. 
 
One piece is what happens when you get everything awesome from pirates of the carribean and dragonan ball z andd ramp it up by 590 times because that is how many episodes there currently are. This is the best anime that has 500+ episodes and unlike other shows it doesn't involve rehashing previous plot elements. It is epic and do not let its premise and appearance fool you.

    It was a long time since I didn't watch an anime , but in September 2014, I had some time and when I was young some friends were watching One Piece, but , I didn't care because I was a fanboy of Dragon Ball and I didn't really touched other animes either.  
 
One day, I just said why not ? Then I started watching , how do you say ? That one anime who made  me fall in love with the Otaku world. 
 
This anime is so damn epic, the bromance between characters , all the epic scenes and of course , the smile of Luffy and his nakama who are each time living amazing adventures ( Not much details on that, discover by yourself like I did)  
 
This anime made me cried , made me smiled , made me laugh (when Luffy imitates Sanji lol) . This anime made me understood how the anime world is powerful. 
 
 
I spent a whole 3 months watching from episode 1 to 667 and now till December I watch the episode each week and we are in 690, I bought the two Pirate Warriors game and now I'm so hype for the third one .  
 
I spent like 300 hours of my life watching this anime , and it was worth it. 
 
Thanks a lot Oda , you made me a better person , I have a new hobby, expand the Otaku world to all my social circle (2 new Otakus btw (:))  
 
 
Watch it, you'll never regret it.

    One Piece. Right now, even at the sound of its name, I’m feeling kind of psychotic and obsessed. There are so many people out there, considering it immature, hollow, ridiculously long, boring, tiring, an anthem to sexism and homophobia and of course, overrated. I’ll try not to spoil anything, but I cannot promise you, guys. 
 
There’s no doubt that One Piece’s duration is huuuge but it’s neither boring nor tiring. And I’m not saying this because I’m a total fan-girl but due to the fact that millions of people, all around the world, support it, all these years, without missing an episode, even the filler ones. Watching it, makes you laugh hard, be amazed of the battles, be happy for no reason and cry your eyes out, out of nowhere. 
  
I am not going to disagree about its kind of childish side either, but there’s no way I am going to call it immature. It’s true, that sometimes, its jokes and lines can be puerile but in a good way that points out innocence and chastity. 
 
Now let’s settle the whole issue about sexism. The target of these theories is one of the main male roles, named Sanji. He is the guy that refuses to hit a woman even when his crew is in danger, he is the guy that saves the female crewmates firstly every single time, he is the guy that nosebleeds seeing women in all sizes and colors, but wait: why is this believed to be so pathetically sexist? I think of him as an enormous exaggeration of gentlemen. He doesn’t objectify females, he is just overprotective and considers them unguarded while he believes that all of them are beautiful. Why isn’t Jiraiya (from Naruto) being so openly attacked?  
Naturally, someone can come here and tell me that even if Sanji isn’t the sexist one, the whole series is anti-feminist because there are no strong women at all. Wrong. Do you guys remember Belle-mere-san, being alone raising two children that weren’t even her own, giving up her job and sacrificing herself for the sake of others? How about Nami, Robin, Koala,Rebecca or Vivi? The two of them have huge bounties and all 5 of them have amazing mental strength. Ain, Monet, Lily Enstomach, Perona, Khalifa, Baby 5: straw hats got a hard time trying to encounter those ladies. Boa Hancock seems to be one of the 7 Warlords and come to think of Big Mama: she is equal to Shanks, I have a bad premonition about her. Maybe most of them cannot win against some really powerful men but they all display an amazing mind and spirit, just as in the real world.  
 
Let’s talk about the homophobic thing. No, as I see it, Mr 2 and Ivankov weren’t just a bother in this anime, weren’t even ridiculously shown. They both had their rough times, they both were powerful as hell and they both were respected by everyone. They were put up as something incredibly natural, that's how it is supposed to be, right? 
 
Now, let’s rate the story-line. Personally, I cannot be strict at all but even when I am trying to see it objectively, I am still giving it a 10. One Piece has an outstanding world, with awesome and original places, powers, objects and people. But the coolest thing about its story is that almost everything is connected. And when I'm telling you ""everything"", I really mean it. There are so many surprises and so many signs that give away the following plot and when you observe them, soon or late, you really feel incredibly blown away. 
 
Art:9. One Piece started airing in 1999, I started watching it at the age of 13, 3 years ago and finished the existing episodes in 2 and a half months. If I had to rate the initial episodes' art, I would probably be strict, but seeing the quality turning amazingly topnotch day by day, made me feel more familiar to this anime in a way I cannot really explain. As much as it concerns about its cartoonish character that doesn't fit the anime world, I'm refusing it with all my power and mind. Personally, from the begining i got to love its kind of ""weird"" animation. 
 
Sound:10. Yes, a ten. The soundtracks are all wonderful and the voice-actors really match every character giving a superb performance every time. To be honest, I'm not keen on dubbed anime, so I cannot really judge them. But as far as it goes for the official japanese one, its quality is optimal! 
 
Characters:10. I've already written about one, Sanji, but there are so many of them, that you can easily identify with at least one and fall in love with at least one! They are all so different from each other and they all have their ideals and goals that turn them into respectful personalities. 
The leader one, Luffy, is similar to Ash Ketchum, Goku or Naruto. But he isn't  a copy either. He has a dream and he is not afraid of anything except of his beloved ones' loss. 
Then there goes Nami, Robin, Chopper, Franky, Usopp, Brook, Sanji, Zoro etc. Every single one of them has a harsh past and everyone has a purpose. Even though they share these two things, they're all unique. They do mistakes, have cons and bad habits, infantile sides and mature ones and they deeply value their family and friends. 
 
Enjoyment: 10. As I said above, it gives you so many mixed feelings in a way that you cannot be fed up. 
 
OVERALL: 10. You might think that I am being indulgent or just blinded of my love, but no, I am not. Okay, maybe little. 
But I am sure, that if you are open-minded, have free time and like getting life lessons through a story, you should all give it at least a chance !

    To be clear, I've been following the OP manga since it began serialization, and I follow it religiously. One Piece is the most epic saga ever written. 
 
That being said, I pretty much despise the animated version, other than a handful of movies such as Chopper's Drun Island movie 
 
To sum it up, 
- bad animation...not only bad, so little content, yet they keep repeating frames 
- bad timing and awkward presentation of punchlines 
- excessive fanservice to the point of stupidity 
- overall bad directing. They always try too hard to look cool, yet they just can't pull it off.  
 
All of these points are probably quite subjective. Over the years I have tried to watch a few episodes here and there, but I couldn't stand it. Then I figured maybe the movies (Strong World) and OVA (3D2Y special) would be better...but no. Same issues that plague the TV, just with better quality animation. 
 
That and I can't fathom watching 700 episodes of a single series. I could use that time to watch 50 other shows.

    i only liked pretty characters and shoujo with romance stories and no action.. BUT one piece is the only exception!!! The characters weren't so pretty, there's no romnce anddd its filled with action. i thought i'd hate it, but then i ended up falling in love with it 
 
Story:The story is AMAZING!!! there's funny times sad times annoyoing times everything! It's like almost as old as me! The story would totally make you wanna keep on watching 
 
Art: Of course when i watched the first episodes i reallly disliked how they were drawn and i dont like how they're drawn frequently either. they were perfectly drawn in 2009 though. I think they're adding way too much boobs on the girls:/ 
 
Character: Of course since this story began before everything else (except pokemon which was only a year older) The main characters have their own uniqe personalities that you cant find anywhere else. they even have their own laughs. 
 
I TOTALLY LOVE IT!!! There's a reason why its been going on for the past 13 years!!! HIGHLYYYY RECOMEND i think One Piece deserves a higher rank than 50 on the top anime list :((

    ONE PIECE !! Words cannot describe how much this has affected me and how much I love it. I am editing this review because I feel like I haven't wrote even NEARLY enough for my personal favorite anime.  If you think I didn't watch enough animes to make that statement well no. I have watched quite a lot. 
 
I hope this review encourages you to watch it. And for anyone who thinks it's childish I can just give you one Youtube video that will clear it all up. It's called 'One Piece in 10 minutes' and its my favorite Youtube video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMa3868D41k 
 
The story and plot start off basic (just a guy becoming the best of the kind aka pirate king) you can't deny that but as it builds up it's really one of the most fascinating, epic, interesting, creative things i've ever seen so a 10 there. 
 
Music wise I STRONGLY believe it has the best music along with Naruto (both) closely beating Pokemon, Fairy Tail and Bleach's music. Openings and endings (it stops having them after a while) are perfect. So definite 10 there.And if you don't think so then here another Youtube video.This one 'One piece best osts' and it has all the best one piece osts- 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5-FuoN7YY 
Art is SUPERB. Every island the strawhats visit are SO unique and fun. There's a lot of fun gadgets,weapons, devil fruits and such getting revealed here and there which just adds to the thrilling and pleasureful art. The animation I can't say much about since it's different each arc. My favorite animation though is the animation in Sabaody arc and East Blue Saga (a lot of people hate its animation but I LOVE it. It's very nostalgic). Then there's the extra stuff in the art (I can name a lot) but one example of what i'm talking about- a river with bunny shapes ! Some of the character designs are weird (Hachi, Bon-clay) but still it's unique while some have such awesome (again unique) character designs (Kuma, Moria, 3 Admirals, Doflamingo). 
 
The characters are some of the best i've seen as well. The main characters are Luffy (the MAIN main character you can say) and his pirate crew (who look NOTHING like the stereotypical pirates). They all have such emotional and heart-wrenching flashbacks that you pretty much INSTANTLY start to appreciate them. I myself love the heck out of all the strawhats but you 'might' not think the same. 10 character wise. But the main characters are DEFINITELY not the only reason 
 
Now some extra reasons as to why it's so awesome. There are SO many epic moments that will leave you with epic-gasms the size of Russia, SO many sad moments that will leave you crying your eyeballs off and SO many heart-warming moments which feels like your heart is being warmed up in a sauna and being massaged 24/7. I can keep babbling about them but even when i'm done I would NOT have covered even 1/3 the 'scenes' that make One Piece so amazing. 
Not to mention the powers are freaking awesome.The concept of obtaining the power are devil fruits. It's kind of stupid I know, getting powers from eating a fruit but you get used to it. The devil fruit gives you a wide range of powers.From being able to create nets to turning into leopards to turning into someone who can create earthquakes an cause cracks in the air. There's just TOO many!! Plus it has my favorite power of all time - rubber (yes Luffy's devil fruit power). And there are other unique powers too. SMOKE is one.  
 
It's only missing romance. But that's not important partly because we have Sanji. So that's not a flaw AT ALL in my book. So yeah for now I can't think of any flaws with this anime other than say the length and filler which aren't that big to me (I will soon mention why). 
 
Now I will counter the flaws people say it has- 
 
The animation for the beginning is bad. NO it's not. that was made somewhere near the 2000s so OBVIOUSLY the animation back then is not going to be very good. But it has the best animation for back then(my opinion). 
 
Too many FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. One Piece actually has some really awesome fillers though (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of One Piece fillers' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip. 
 
Too long. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 3 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times). An whenever I wasn't busy I marathoned it. An plus I myself like it long. If something's good then wouldn't you want more of it? 
 
If you are not giving it a chance or have watched like 2 episodes and don't like it then watch these episodes- 1-3 (they are not that good but it's just for an introduction to the show), 4, 24, 26, 35 and 36. Then resume from episode 5 once you know you will love the series. 
 
This is the longest review I did but its worth it getting my opinion across about what I believe to be the greatest 'thing' ever. I have more reasons for giving it a 10 but you might not and probably won't relate to them. there may be some reasons here you might disagree with me for but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this 10/10. 
 
So keep watching it cause 'it be one of the most fuscinaten things you'll eva see in the deep blue of the sea'. And maybe you'll even think it to be 'the greatest and most fun adventure of your life', just like I do. 
 
Overall rating- Gazillion/10.

          This is the first anime I watched and alhtough I loved it at first, due to crappy animation and episodes consisting of %90 recap recently, Im really sad and giving this show an overall of 5.  
      Almost all of the characters are loveable in One Piece. The story revolves around Luffy traveling from island to island as he makes new friends to find One Piece. This adventure is generally funny, sometimes sad, but enjoyable in overall. However, as I stated before, the crappy animation totally ruined this anime(at least last 200 episodes), but you can still read manga tough.  
      If in future, some good animation company summarize the whole story to 200 epsiodes or so with great animation, this will be one of the best animes without doubt. But, currently, I do not suggest watching this to anyone.

    When One Piece is over it will probable be known as the greatest shonen- battle anime of all time. 
 
One Piece, an adventure following the main character Monkey D. Luffys journey on becoming the pirate king, who has sailed all over Grand Line. During the journey he finds new crewmates, each with a different charcter and goal. The difference with One Piece and other animes is how each crewmate gets his 
?her own backstory, making them so much more lovable, and you relate to them much more than you rodinary would. Despite the harsh jokes, and malignanat behaviour towards each other, they are bonded with the bonds of nakama that can not be cut. With One Piece you follow a journey where you probably will cry, laugh, and scream with excitment over the epic battles, intense arcs and great plotting.  
 
One thing with One Piece is that there are so many character outside the strawhats, each with their unike abilitiy and character design that you just love. Even thou you barely se them you cling to them, wondering what they will do next. Shanks, Ace Whitebeard, Mihawk, Law and many others. One Piece is perefectly organized, you wont find a single plot-hole, and the story is filled with mysteries. The story line is impregnible, and the story line can not be compared with other shonen-battle animes, that are great, but nowhere nere the level of One Piece Greatness. 
The only flaw is that it sometimes can be slow paced, but considering the amount of episode, it wont affect the greatness of the story.

    One Piece is and will always be one of my favorite anime shows, however there are some things that could have been better. 
 
Story: 9 
     The story of One Piece started out pretty simple.  Become the king of the pirates.  In a way, to me this is similar to Naruto's goal of becoming Hokage.  We all know its going to happen, we just don't know how.  In order to reach this simple goal, many smaller goals take place.  This includes finding a ship, gaining crew members, crossing the grand line, and finding the pirate king's treasure and each of these smaller goals contain more objectives within.  It's these simpler objectives that makes the main goal of the story better.  The reason why this is not a 10 is because the story is sometimes repetitive.  For example, each time a new crew member is introduced it goes like this;  New member introduced, member in some kind of trouble, main character helps new member, new member becomes official.  This happens EVERY time.  Although its predictable, this is still enjoyable because we get to see the process of how it happens. 
 
Art: 7 
     You've probably already heard the artwork sucks.  To me this is not the case.  Yeah, in the first couple of arcs the artwork could have been better, but they were never terrible.  Keep in mind the show was out for 15 years.  As time progressed, so did the artwork.  Now, I'd say the art is actually pretty good.  Not the best, but not bad either. 
 
Sound: 10 
     I don't have much to say about the sound.  The music fits the theme of the show and makes it that much better. 
 
Character: 9 
     The character development is great!  Throughout the show, the viewers grow closer to each of the characters.  I'm not an emotional person, however there were a couple of times where because I was so attached to the characters, tears began to form once something bad happened.   
     The only flaw yet again is that it repeats itself.  One way that the viewers grow towards the characters is that each time a new one is introduced, there is a flashback of the character as a child showing the hardships they went through.  Yes, this is a good way to help the audience relate to the character, but to do this every time starts to take away from the show a little. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
As mentioned before, this will always be one of my favorites.  The show has everything I enjoy.  The action scenes are exciting, the story keeps me interested, just the right amount of comedy without going over the top, emotional moments, and the perfect amount of fan service ( after time skip it gets heavier, but I don't mind ).  I enjoyed this show so much I started it last summer, and caught up to the story line within the same summer.   
 
Overall: 
I say overall this anime is a 9 simply because of the repetition, and the number of episodes.  The storyline and everything else is amazing, but now a days people are busy and they don't have enough time to catch up on 685 episodes.  And to watch all these episodes knowing how the process will take place at times is kind of a drag. 
 
Thanks for taking the time to read my review.  This is my first anime review ever.  Hit me up and tell me what you think.

    One Piece is a super long anime about pirates. The aspect of pirates is still there as the show progresses but fades into the background. Aside from that I feel One Piece is one of the greatest anime's of all time. 
 
The shows as such amazing characters. The debates of who is the best characters can get a room of watchers all fired up. The main characters have so many iconic character traits to make the stand out. Even supporting character can get your emotions flowing.  
 
One Piece is an emotional roller coaster. It can take you from happy to angry the to balling your eyes out in just a few episodes. things will get fore shadowed hundreds of episodes early. the world created in One Piece has so much lore, wonders and mysteries from sky islands to fish men.  
 
Some people do not like art of One Piece but i think its what makes it so much more like able and original.  
 
The openings will get you pump up every time you start an episode. 
 
This is my favorite anime i hope it can touch you the same way it does me.

    Alright, being my favourite anime/manga, I feel a need to review this. 
 
One Piece starts off on a pretty average note. Nothing spectacular. Being a very old show (started in 1997), the art is quite shitty at first. To drop the show because of this reason alone is a bad mistake. Think of it more like a fine wine that ages exceedingly well over time. 
 
Moving on, ""it looks too childish"". I've heard that a lot from people who haven't watched it, and I'm sure I even thought it myself at one point. Sadly, Oda's unique art style does look very stylized and might be difficult to get used to. Give it a few episodes however and you will realized that the art lends itself to the plot perfectly. The designs are unique and the settings are creative. Without a doubt, you will love it in no time. 
 
It's quite fair to mention that Oda is a huge fan of exposition and meticulous planning. Love it or hate it, it only serves to add that extra layer of depth to the story. All his story arcs have a lasting impact and he never forgets about the characters he introduces. The unbelievable lack of any real plot holes in such a long running series demonstrates his attention to detail and love of his craft. 
 
Sure, many of you will scoff when you hear One Piece is a masterpiece. Really thou, I scoff at that too. Oda makes mistakes like any author and the plot moves quite slow at some points (a disease mostly exclusive to the anime). However, what One Piece excels at is its sheer amount of entertainment. So what if it's not Shakespeare. It will definitely bring you more fun than Hamlet ever would. 
  
Overall, One Piece has grown on me like no story ever has. Throw away your doubts and give it try. Before you know it, you'll only be wanting more. 
 
 
---Common misconceptions and preposed solutions--- 
 
-Think you're too mature for ""shounen shit""? 
Get over yourself.  
 
-Not a fan of long ass anime?  
Read the manga! I highly recommend it as it is devoid of the many pacing issues present in the anime. 
 
-Actively hate on it because it's part of the Big 3? 
Again, get over yourself. ""Big 3"" is an incredibly moronic way to lump three totally different manga together just because of their sales. 
 
-Hate it because of the fans? 
Hate the fans, not the author. Make your own decision on the story based on YOUR experience. 
 
-Don't like the concept of pirates? 
Do ""rubber, panty loving, cyborg, samurai, sexy, reindeer pirates"" change your mind? 
 
-Manga is also too long? 
Don't gimme that shit. You're reading my long ass review so you must have quite the free time. 
 
-Already caught up in it? 
Fuck yea, brofist.

    Before I start reviewing this series , I would like to just say one thing. The anime does the manga LITTLE TO NO justice. In this review , I would be comparing the anime to its manga counterpart. How should I put it ? The closest words that I can find to describe this anime is probably , horribly-paced. 
 
Disclaimer : All of this are my personal opinion and is not intended to offend anyone by any means. 
 
Story : 7/10 
In regards to the storyline , I'm generally okay with it as unlike the other two popular shounen series like Bleach and Naruto , One Piece has little fillers (don't even get me started on Naruto please). And the anime follows the manga almost strictly in terms of storyline. I would have given it a higher mark if not for the animators screwing up the Hody VS Luffy fight. It made Luffy look superbly WEAK. 
 
Art : 2/10 
One Piece is generally infamous for it's simplicity in its drawing and many people simply cannot get used to this , often irked by it compared to other animes/manga with great character designs and such. However , since the anime follows the manga , I will not fault the anime for this. 
 
However, what's really nerve-wrecking is that the animation and drawing is shit. Pardon me but yes. Just one look at the Sabaody Archipelago arc almost gave me cancer literally. I guess that's what happens when all the senior animators are dispatched to work on the movie and the juniors are free to do with the anime. I could still list a bunch of arcs with simply horrible animations that looked as though the animators wanted to be just be done with it and that's all. (Fishman arc for example ; biggest let down of 2013 after all the finishers looked like shit) Other than that, hardly any animation in this series is worth-noticing. 
 
Sound : 6/10 
The soundtracks are generic and the only ones that really stands out from the rest is probably The Very Very Very Strongest and Luffy's Fierce Attack and maybe Giant Stronghold Takeoff. But just these three tracks itself is not able to carry such a long anime and it gets seriously repetitive after awhile. 
 
As for the openings and endings, sorry to say but I'm not a fan of any except for Share The World. I would have given it somewhere along 3/10 if not for the voice actors. 
 
The voice actors themselves. All I can say is , hats off to them. Let's start with the notable mentions. 
 
Luffy - Godlike contagious laughter and epic speech (very very very rarely). Job well done for voicing the goofy Luffy and I wouldn't be able to find anyone else that could possibly do a better job than Mayumi Tanaka. All I hope is that the voice actor lives to voice the remaining of the series (not cursing but she's getting old and the series still have a long way to go) 
 
Zoro - Needless to say , epic speech , epic speech everywhere. There's something about his voice that makes almost everything he says so much more epic than any other character would. "" I got on the wrong ship. -_+ "". Probably the only character that can make something that silly sound cool. Legit. 
 
Usopp/Sogeking - Do I even have to elaborate? This guy is freaking hilarious along with a contagious laughter and his awful screaming. And oh , the most memorable scene ? Arabasta and Enies Lobby speech about Luffy. Nuff said. Sogekinguuuu!! 
 
Chopper - This is a honourable mention because I cried at his past. No joke and his voice actor who happens to be the same seiyuu for pikachu did an extraordinary job voicing him especially during drum island. You could feel the sheer emotions coming out from her voice when Chopper starts to cry. 
 
Brook - YOHOHOHOHOHOHO! 
 
The rest of the characters were pretty average or nothing note-worthy. (Buggy is an exception to this though). This is the reason why the sound gets a 6/10 instead of a 3/10. 
 
Character : 8/10 
 
Like the manga series, each character are given a single arc to tell their past and such. After that , each character slowly gets developed and there are evident character development. One notable example would be Zoro who told Luffy when they first met that if Luffy were to do anything to hinder him from becoming the world's strongest swordsman , he would kill him. However as time passed , Zoro began to respect Luffy as the captain and would even lay down his life for him if needed (when against Kuma). 
 
Each character is also diverse and unlike other anime series that have a huge cast , all the characters are not just a vase as they contribute to the series greatly as well instead of just giving one liners just to show their 'presence'. 
 
Enjoyment : 3/10 
 
The enjoyment of this anime , sadly to say , does not live up to the story and character because of the crappy art that really put me off. But that's not the worst thing , it's the pacing that killed this anime. Toei strictly abided by it's ground rule that an One Piece episode must follow exactly one manga chapter which probably caused this downfall of a great series. 
 
Although the manga is well-paced, with the author taking seldom breaks because of his family and health issues, the anime did no justice to it because of the ridiculously slow pacing. And because of the pacing , the Whitebeard war that was absolutely amazing in the manga turned out like shit in the anime. The art was pretty decent there but the pacing.. oh god. I think I heard Luffy screaming Ace's name for over thirty episodes and a part of me simply just died. 
 
If only if the anime could pick up the pacing and do probably something like 1.5chapters/episode, or maybe improve on it by adding additional dialogues for each character which I definitely would not mind instead of showing characters running around doing nothing or FLASHBACKS. That would be great. Don't get me started on the censorship please. 
 
Overall : 3/10 
 
It's a shame that I would have to give this great series such a low grade but as things stand. It's not worthy of any higher marks in my personal opinion. Unless the anime can do something about the horrible pacing , this is the final score I would give this series. 
 
And yes, I'm heavily biased against the anime because it simply does not live up to the manga like most animes. For those that have not check the manga out , do it and you would probably find better enjoyment than wasting twenty minutes each week just staring at characters running about doing literally nothing and the plot progress like a snail.

    One of my favorite anime of all time and it only took my a few months to watch it all as that is how addicted I am to this anime. May be a bit long with 575 episodes since the time of writing of this review, but it is totally worth it.  
 
Great character development. Love Nakama power. Fighting is awesome as well as the powers. Very funny at the best of times and is very hard to stop watching once you get into it.  
 
It may be a bit slow at the beginning but that is pretty much with all anime but once you start watching a whole lot, it gets better and better.  
 
 
All I can say is pure awesome and I hope it goes on for a very long time.

    Short Sweet Reviews: One Piece!!! 
Pros: Great characters each unique and amazing, Great story full of adventure, action, laughs, drama and even tears of both sadness and joy. 
Cons: Even though One Piece is my favorite anime it was some flaws for instants: it's already 500+ which sadly will scare any new comer to this anime. Some arcs drag a little to long ans sometimes there is a little to much talking and not enough fighting not to mention the fillers though this anime is not like Bleach or Naruto which are infested with fillers but there are fillers just to warn you! 
Overall: One Piece is an amazing anime that has everything you can ever want in an anime: Action,Adventure,Drama,Superpowers, Pirates, e.c.t e.c.t. Despite it's long episode count if your intrested in this anime it won't dissapoint you!

    One Piece is those types of anime that would get people immersed in it. The story, the characters, and even things like a boat stick to the watcher's memory. But, if you those people who care mostly about the art and short fighting scenes, then this might not be the best anime for you. 
 
The story and and its characters are probably the strongest aspects of One Piece. Each ark portrays the situation very clearly, and foreshadows some future problems without being forced in. Throughout One Piece, it talks about many things like friendship, family, segregation, the abuse of power, and freedom. And, it never gets boring... other than some fillers and the first part of 300s. While some people may argue that this anime has been going on for so long that it has gotten boring, it has not. Every single part has something completely new while integrating the past to develop the story... something many stories lack. 
 
The characters are extremely diverse, so it is really easy to distinguish them. I have heard people say that the characters never develop, but looking deeper... the characters e.g. Luffy has gotten more mature, and made better decisions & past antagonists have become the victims, or protagonists. But, they have not developed so much in just 2 years that it has gotten unrealistic. 
 
Fight scenes are eh. They go on to 10-20 episodes at a time. But, for people who like fight scenes showing what is going on everywhere, then this is good for you. 
 
Then, finally the art. Nop. Not the greatest. Same with the sound. But, after the new world, it has improved greatly! So, hoping that future episodes will continue to gain better art and stuff.

    Story ~ It all begins in the East Blue, an ocean where the main character of our story, Monkey D. Luffy begins his journey in search of the legendary treasure at the end of the Grand Line known as the One Piece. The One Piece is said to be a treasure that if obtained will make all your wishes come true, the l;ast person to ever find the One Piece was Gol D. Roger the king of the pirates. Luffy aims to overturn Roger and become the new king while learning making a crew, getting a ship, battling against the world goverment itself and becoming a criminal all in favour of finding One Piece. 
 
Art ~ The art style is fantastic, it loses a point for the fact that Toei doesn't make it look very ""amazing"" but the awesome designs, clothes and fights will make up for that! 
 
Sound ~ Beautiful harmonious music that fits any mood. 
 
Character ~ Some of the most bizarre character designs ever seen although each character has their own awesome colourful personality. 
 
Enjoyment ~ I'm at the Post-Arabasta filler arc and already I'm looking forward to Skypiea, each major arc will leave you with an awesome feeling of enjoyment making you probably want to re-watch it if you ever run ahead of episodes. 
 
Overall ~ Oda's marvellous creation One Piece is not to be missed. It's a must for any adventurous anime fan!

    SPOILER FREE REVIEW 
 
One Piece is, in a word, perfect. Just perfect. Honestly, I was a bit reluctant to watch it at first because, to me, a story about a boy wanting to become ""Pirate King"" sounded so bland, cliche and overall boring, and the art style was a bit too old-school for my liking, but I was dead wrong! There is nothing boring about it. 
 
I find that a lot of people complain about the length, or the art, or whatever, but the thing is, once I really got into One Piece, I just completely forgot about the art style and the length and focused on the anime itself. By the way, the animation EVENTUALLY improves... eventually. 
 
I'd also like to discuss Luffy, the main character. I love how the stereotypical “protagonist” is just thrown out the window when it comes to Luffy. What you need to know about Luffy is that no, he is not a hero. Yes, he admits that he admires heroes, but he certainly doesn't wanna be one. Simply put, he’s a pirate. He seeks freedom and doesn’t give a damn about Justice. 
 
I guess that's one of the things I found most enjoyable; you can just get submerged in the Straw Hat’s adventure’s as if you yourself are also there laughing, having fun, or even crying with them. I just love the interactions between the crew members, (especially Sanji and Zoro) as well as just the characters themselves. Everyone in the anime is unique and have there own little quirks to them, and, seeing how absolutely massive the world of One Piece is, Eiichiro Oda certainly did a fantastic job. Also, the balance between action and humour is definitely worth mentioning. 
 
I could go on and on about how great this is, for like forever, but I don't think you wanna read that. Anyways, if you haven't watched One Piece, you really are missing out because I can say honestly and without any hesitation whatsoever that One Piece is one of those few anime which can truly be considered as a ""Master Piece"".

    Just as any other person, this is a mere opinion, a writing of what I believe about One Piece.  
 
** Very little, if not any spoilers ** 
 
Throughout all 800 episodes I have watched, I have always felt enjoyment watching One Piece. It contains amazing character development, music to hype you up for what happens even when it someday hits 1000 episodes, and despite how it may seem, it is not just an anime with a ton of episodes behind it. It's a story. A beautiful story about a boy, Luffy, and his journey. It is an anime that will make you feel happy, it will make you laugh, it will make you sad, and you will connect with the characters as if you truly knew them. As you watch, you will embrace their stories. Albeit One Piece's animation and quality may not be the best, this is not what you should watch it for. You may be able to juxtapose Luffy's story as a boy going against the biggest obstacle known to the world. He has ambitions, and the way he relentlessly strives towards them is a monument of motivation towards us, the audience.  
 
One Piece excels in character development, and is a must watch for Anime fans. It is a vast and rich story that is meant for one to embrace and fall in love with.

    One Piece 
 
One Piece is a Manga series produced by Eiichiro Oda. Before he produced One Piece he had already produced several series including ""Wanted"" and ""Monsters and Romance Dawn"". The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy whose body gets the properties of rubber after eating one of the many devils fruits (which are fruits that give certain powers) that prevent him from swimming. With his crew called Straw Hat pirates. One Piece is by far the best anime I have seen. But not everyone shares the same opinion as me, let's fix that, shall we? 
 
The story of One Piece usually consists of the Straw Hat Pirates who travel from island to island and experience crazy adventures. Although every crew member has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: reaching the end of the treacherous Grand Line. 
The style of One Piece is one of the elements that brings many people to the series. The style is quite old like Dragonball Z. Anyway, the quality of the animation improves steadily as the show moves. The show is now broadcast in HD. 
 
I absolutely love the music of One Piece. There are so many different types of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, happy, scared, epic, intense, and so on. For each of these situations there is a unique piece of music that plays in the background. What's more is that each character has his own style of music? 
 
Unlike the majority, I find the animation creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately, people see it as something or a twist and One Piece quickly assesses something infantile. An anime does not have to be complex to be good enough. It can be anything, as long as it provides satisfaction. And One Piece does that.

    This is the first review I have written on the website. I would like to start off by saying that there may be light SPOILERS in the review so if you do not want anything ruined, read with care. As I am writing this review, I have seen 557 episodes.  
 
Coming into the show, the only long running shounen that I had seen was Naruto. I loved watching Naruto grow through the years as I aged. When I was young I loved watching this 12 year old ninja refuse to give up his dream of being Hokage even when everyone told him it wouldn't happen. As I aged, so did Naruto. One Piece is a show that I was a little unsure about since it has very little filler compared to Naruto. The time commitment through the 800+ episodes is much longer than Naruto. Naruto and One Piece are very different shows, however. Naruto is focused on the adventures in and around the hidden leaf village and it does not stray too far from that area. That leads me into my next topic. 
 
After making it through some of the early arcs, I really found out what makes this show so lovable. The world building is done wonderfully. You can actually trace on a map of the world where the characters adventure to and the history that it builds is one that the writer does an excellent job of using. 
 
There are characters in the show that you might think of as throw away in similar shows. Not in One Piece. I think the best example of this in the show is Bon Clay. He is used as a villain very early in the show and is absent for hundreds of episodes before reappearing as one of my favorite characters in the show. Every characters you meet could hold importance later down the line. The writer does a great job taking advantage of this great world building and history to make the story interesting.  
 
The main cast of characters is wonderful as well. I found myself annoyed with Usopp through many of the early arcs as he had very little worth in the crew. It was hard to love his character. This is true for both the audience and himself. Through the shows run time, his goal is to face his fears and become a brave warrior of the sea. Watching him grow in strength from liar to sniper king to post timeskip helped me to gain more respect for him. Sanji and Zoro are the captains right and left hand men who always come through in a pinch. Both of these characters have their own unique traits that run through the show and always manage to make me smile. The rest of the crew helps to make one of the most lovable casts I have seen in a while, which is good because you have 800 episodes to spend with them! I would say more but talking about some of the other crew members may spoil different parts of the show. 
 
Luffy is one of my favorite characters in shounen. I like him as much if not more than our lord and savior Naruto. Luffy may be a goofy, energetic and impulsive leader, but when it comes to his friends, he will do everything in his power to fight for them. Luffy isn't a great leader because of he is wise nor is he a great leader due to his strength. He is a great leader because everyone who he leads knows he will have their back. Time and time again he shows his resolve and it is this resolve to be a good friend that gives him the strength that he gets through the show. That and his dream of becoming king of the pirates.  
 
The show has a bunch of extremely unique abilities that make the fights unpredictable and interesting. The devil fruit powers in the show can be anything making each new obstacle that the crew must overcome more fun to watch. There were certain times where I wondered how Luffy would ever manage to beat some of the baddies. I think this is where Naruto and One Piece split the most. Naruto got to the point near the end where it was one giant explosion bomb after another. Whoever made the bigger bomb was usually big daddy boi. Watching Luffy learn about the world of pirates on the grand line was just as exciting for him as it was for me because I never really knew what was coming next. 
 
I would like to note that if you are looking for a serious anime, this one might not be for you. This is not to say that there aren't any scenes where Luffy is serious. This said, One Piece does a great job of making the serious bits hold a tone that is appropriate for the scene.  
 
Overall, I love One Piece. The animation suffers in some points and it can feel like the show is moving slowly during a lot of the early material especially, but what we have is an amazing adventure with a great cast of characters that will make you feel as though you are a member of the Straw Hat crew yourself. I would recommend the show to anyone who can handle the long run time that it has or anyone who likes some enjoyable and creative fighting. Through it's flaws, One Piece is one of my favorite animes to date and I can't wait to see where the rest of my adventure with the Straw Hat Pirates takes me.  
 
Thanks for taking the time to read my reivew!  
 
*edit: I have finished the Doflamingo arc at this point. The show definitely drops in quality towards the later parts, but there is a lot to love about it.

    I love One Piece, it is not my favorite anime but i do like it a lot, i did a cosplay of Sanji in two different conventions (even though he is not my favorite character, he was one of the easiest to do). 
 
The real problem with this anime is that it's just too long, it gets repetitive real quick, i'm gonna finish the anime that's for sure, i watch the new episode each week, but some times i'd like if they could just get to the point faster, there are scenes we have seen at least 5 times since the start of the show. 
But as far as i know, this is a problem with the anime itself, not the manga. 
 
Other than that, it has a good story, enjoyable characters, an anverage humour. 
 
But i'd recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime. 
Except if you really hate reading but if you do like a good read then i'd read the manga instead of watching the anime, and if you truly love One Piece and do not care about filters and having the same scene over and over again then you can always read the manga and watch the anime. 
 
 
So in the end, it's good but they really need to go on with the story, sure it's cool to have lot of episodes of something we like, but like i said, when it's always scenes that are used over and over again, it just prove that they don't want to put too much effort on it, but once again, that's about the anime, not the manga. 
And second point, i'd actually like to see the ending, there are lot of anime which we will maybe never see the ending such as Berserk, Hunter × Hunter, etc... 
 
So good anime in itself, the primary problem is that it is very slow, too slow.

    okay, so 817 episodes... that's a lot and the beginning is quite slow, but every 100 episodes it gets faster. When i got to episode 100 I thought that it too a whole lot of time and i'm never gonna catch up, but then i got to episode 200 and I was surprised that i'm here already and around the water seven arc is where for me personally I got officially hooked to the point where i knew i was gonna watch this series to the end. The character development you get through the entire story is amazing, including the world development. the art looks kinda dumb and cartoony at first but then you get used to it and it looks amazing and the Toei animations brings out so many feelings when watching is amazing episodes 817 is a good example and episodes 278 is an older example but still fantastic. 
honestly this show is probably on of if not my favorite show in general, this show has made me feel for the straw hats like i was right there next to them going through all of the adventures with them, and this show is not like your typical adventure pirates show and luffy is the cause of that i'm not going to go into detail but luffy the main character is the main cause any one starts watching this show and no matter who your favorite character is you're gonna love luffy you're gonna smile when he does something that in retrospect is the dumbest thing that he could have done in that situation and still some how pull through. Thanks for reading my rant on this fantastic show.

    Okay so this is my first review and let me start off by saying that i wont give a 3 hour summary on one piece. But instead, i will tell you what you will be going through while you watch this anime. 
 
 When you watch this anime you will laugh, get angry, smile, be pumped up, stressed, frustrated, happy ,cry and so many other emotions that i cant explain. 
The reason you will be going through this is because when you watch this anime you will grow so attached to each character and how they feel you will feel like they are part of your family.  
 
I used to hate this show because i saw a couple of episodes on tv and didnt give it a chance but then by friend told me that if i didnt at least like the anime by episode180 he would give me 20 dollars. So i watched the anime from episode 1 to 180 and fell in love with it but i told my friend i hated it still and got that 20 dollars. But the point is that if you watch at least 180 episodes you will love it. I know most of you are thinking that if it takes 180 episodes to like something is wayyy to long but the reason that is, is because within that time span you will get to know and become friends with the characters. SO I GIVE ANYONE WHO READS THIS THE 180 CHALLENGE!!!!! If you take this challenge you must watch 180 episodes of one piece and if you dont like it by then, you can give yourself 20 dollars!!!!  
 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHa i totally made a 3 hour review and i didnt mean to lol

    Man.. every week I await for the arrival of a new episode , there was not a single letdown, the episodes rarely had repetition of previous chapters and is always filled with new content 
 
Story 8/10 
Oda is a brilliant author, many folks would just believe one piece is a pirate killing and blundering things. One piece is a story of a young boy whom aspired to be a pirate, his immature, reckless and stubborn often give author no choice but to admire his actions. The plot twists and the slow foreshadowing of  unrevealed characters such as the Yonko, shichibukai and navy admirals always kept readers in suspense. However the episode may be dragged unnecessarily, creating a turnoff 
 
Art 8/10 
The animation is great, it depicts the characters flawlessly. Toei animation also paid attention to even the smallest details, which readers would spot and would propose various theories in their mind. However there were moments where the animators fail to design the character fully, giving them a somewhat distorted face, thus a 8/10  
 
Sound 8/10 
SHINING RUNNING FOREVER and the battle music is sick. But some openings were just damn terrible, the overused yelling and screaming can be annoying at times. 
 
Character 8/10 
A solid 10/10, the character development such as the time skip period is perfected. Fueled with sadness and despair once a relative dies, the characters development closely reflects those in real life. The process is insane, as story progresses, the 10 main characters takes on tougher opponents. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 
Funny, action-packed and mind-blowing, One Piece is without doubt a very enjoyable manga. The moments when a serious situation is overridden by a hilarious comment is very funny. The sight of seeing the main character's strong determination and willpower is great to watch 
 
Overall 8/10 
IT IS A BEST SEE

    I make this clear. I'm not a fanboy who only seen this serie and proclaims that it is the best thing in the world. I saw so many anime and I truly think that One Piece is ONE of the best anime/manga of all Time.  
 
The plot is incredible and the cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in anime and the seiyuu who play them fit perfectly into it. Luffy and his friends makes you cry like a bitch and laugh like a cow and THAT'S the awesomeness of One Piece.  
 
I had goose bumps when Robin says "" I WANNA LIVE "". 
I cried for Ace in MarineFord. 
I was laughing out loud when Zorro get Lost. (9999 times)  
I was pissed of when Kuma detroyed the "" Mugiwara "" ! 
 
The Storyline is so complex that characters are only growing up and make them more Interesting and it's clever from Oda to enlarge the univers of One Piece before developing a Character.  
 
That's why One Piece is awesome. It makes you feel full of emotion and not many anime do the same.  
 
 For me One piece is just a Masterpiece and thank god it's still going on !

    When I try to get people to watch this sometimes they have to complain about the same things over and over again. When you read what it's about a lot of people think ""Pirates? No way am I watching that."" Even though it took me a while to want to watch it because I'm a picky person about art styles and what it was about, however I thought it was amazing after the first 5 episodes. The characters all have their own unique personalities which separates them from other anime characters and the first 350 I think episodes are dubbed but the ones by 4kids or whatever is NOT dub it's just something lame. You will honestly enjoy this anime packed with fighting, anime weirdness, hilarious ness and other surprises.

King of Kings. A juggernaut of anime/manga. Being one of Shonen Jump's 3 Kings, it certainly lives up to its hype. One Piece has enabled me to experience a vast world of adventure, friendship, loyalty, and dreams. With the vast world that Eiichiro Oda has masterfully created, the grippling plots that surprise you when you least expect them, and the lovable characters, it's no wonder One Piece has been the highest selling manga for several consecutive years. 
 
With over 600 episodes to date, one may be intimidated to start the series. I agree, it may seem daunting AT FIRST. But trust me, once you start, you'll be unexpectedly marathoning all the episodes and end up wanting more.  
 
Give it a try. It is not the best selling manga in Japan for nothing.

Bom, se tratando de One Piece eu sou meio sempre imparcial, até porque, é o meu anime favorito de longe. Quando se começa a ver esse anime, dá até uma impressão de ser meio infantil, mas essa impressão passa logo, depois de Alabasta, você já tem outro olhar. 
Minha saga favorita é Thriller Bark, e depois Impel Down empatado com Enies Lobby. Eu acho One Piece um anime genial.  
E as aberturas de OP ninguém bate. One Day, We Are, We Go, entre outras. 
One Piece: Para quem não assistiu, recomendo mil vezes!

    Man, where do I start with one piece. This anime is my number one overall and that will never change. The reasoning behind that is just the love I have for one piece. I guess I could also point out that I've been watching this since I was in 3rd grade. One piece started airing in 1999. I started 3rd grade in 2005. I've been watching it for 10 years and still counting! The story is amazing along with the characters. The soundtrack is also great. I know the animation isn't on ufotable's or Madhouse's level but it's good when it needs to be and that's fine. If you ask me if I would recommend this to anybody you bet I would BUT nowadays people are right about the show being too long. So I'd just tell people how awesome it is. If you are gonna watch it then go for it! I will tell you this tho. You definitely WON'T regret watching it.

    You stumbled across this page, because you wondered what is One Piece, but probably, your most important question, that has been poking your mind since some time is: Should I watch it? 
 
Now the basic facts. There are currently 688 episodes aired, and that's probably bit more than half of the planned material Eiichiro Oda (the manga creator) has . To catch up to the current arc you would need to sacrifice around 40 average anime series (or you could do just a lot of different staff in your life, right?). That's more than ten days of constant watching. So how to measure if it's worth it? How to benchmark it? 
 
Before you will read further you need to be totally aware of one thing: the anime is slow, the pacing is awful, more so then ever in the newest arcs. It's like they are trying to squeeze all the money they can from the audience (the Toei animation studio), the same thing that Naruto is currently doing. 
Also, the anime in my opinion, has a pretty much a love/hate relationship going on, and to measure it for yourself, you would need to consider watching around 100-110 episodes. Now if compared to 700 or 1000 it's or even more it's not that bad... 
 
The reason for that, is that the real action begins with the Alabasta Saga (saga consists of few arcs), that starts at episode 62. If the Alabasta Saga won't get your full attention, you will feel forced to stare at the screen etc., dislike this and that, then you should consider dropping  One Piece for your own safety. If, on the other hand, you will find yourself immersed in the anime, waiting impatiently before you can watch the next episode, welcome on the love train.  
 
Also consider this. One thing is to watch anime that has the standard 12-24 episodes (or just a bunch of seasons), another thing is to watch anime that has hundreds of episodes. Obviously, to keep the quality level constant in such big series (or manga series for the fact) is just impossible. If you won't like Alabasta, it will be hard to keep on watching later. Now there are better arcs then Alabasta, but do you want to watch another 100 episodes just to get to them?  
       
All in all, the best way, from the neutral point of view would be just to write down the aspects that create One Piece, make it what it is, and depend on how you respond to them, watch or just leave, it's just as simple as that, having of course in mind what I wrote above: 
•	Humor with mix of goofing around 
•	Slow, bad pacing at times 
•	Long Battles - full shounen style 
•	Good Story that connects all the Sagas 
•	Great Characters with their own personal story (especially the crew) 
•	Many black and white characters, you are either good or bad 
•	Simple, meaningful emotions, that even the youngest audience will understand (especially friendship) 
•	Repetitive at times  
•	Very good voice acting ( I am NOT watching a dubbed version) 
•	Pretty much no death  
•	Just decent music and art even in the newest arcs 
•	Enormous world and enormous amount of characters that you will stumble across your journey 
•	Creativity regarding the laws, history, organizations, countries, buildings (size of some of them is truly astounding) and most obviously all the POWERS the shounen characters get  
•	Predictable at times 
•	Generally, over the top design of many aspects of the manga and anime 
•	Misconception regarding some terms: like pirates, government, marines etc. 
 
Know the author of this simple review is a bit of fan of series, but I tried to stay as objective as possible. So the high score for me is obvious.  
 
Thanks for reading.

    I have been watching one piece for years (This includes re watching the series multiple times) and not once have I regretted watching this show. It has an easy to follow story for those who are of younger age, yet at the same time it can capture an audience of a much older generation. 
 
This is a tale of friendship and dreams. It can inspire people to never give up on those two things which is important, for if you don't have your dreams and your friends then you don't have much of anything. 
 
There are some great fight scenes and  some parts of this show are heart wrenching but the crew always makes it through in the end showing that if you truly believe in something you can do anything. A great message for everyone.

    One Piece is something which can not be explained by words, even though I will try my best to do it. Most people say One Piece get's better as you keep on watching the show, and I totally agree. But there is always a downside to the upside, newbies to the show. We ask all the time when does it get better? When does it get better? The truth is, if you don't like the first 100 episodes give up the show, got it? That's my perspective of this arguement against newbs and fans.  
 
Now, time for the actual review.  
 
Story: One Piece starts off very slow, when it comes to the storyline, but it improves as times go on. The story in One Piece can not be explained in 200 or even 300 episodes unlike some animes. The world is so complex and the story just adds to the world itself. Keep in mind that, One Piece does geniunly excell at story in later episodes, such as my personal favorite, Alabasta Arc! 
 
Art: One Piece is not known because of it's art style. In fact, I would call it mediocre. I don't personally favorite the art style, but it's better than some other animes I have watched. 
 
Sound: The soundtrack for this anime is very good. It provides decent OST's which makes the anime way more exciting and impressive. I want to say though that the soundtracks do get repetitive as time goes on. Each character also has their own music track apparently because of the mid-show cutscenes which depict the character, and their own music which is fun to guess for me. 
 
Character: I don't know how to stress this enough! The character's in this show are off the hook! The charcacter development stems way beyond any other anime or manga I have watched/read. You may become so attached to the characters, you might start hating the villians because you hope they won't sever that connection you have with those characters. 
 
Enjoyment: This anime get's a nine for enjoyment. I know what all of you fans are saying though, ""WTF!??"" and ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!??"" because One Piece deserves a 10. The only reason I put a 9 was because of the starting episodes, and other than that this definitely is pure awesomeness. This world is so enjoyable and so are the characters. In fact, I would say it's easy to get addicted to One Piece! The beginning episodes though, not so much! Some people might say though, that the story is slow-paced, so they don't like it, but the story must be slow-paced in order to explain this magnifecent world! 
 
Overall: One Piece is amazing in it's own ways, but does have flaws in it's own ways too. The pro's outnumber the con's though, but there are still a bunch of cons. This world truly is worth giving a try, but be warned if you don't like the first 100 episodes, just quit! I give this a 9!

    Before I started watching this series, I hated pirates. I thought One Piece looked ridiculous and I refused to watch a show that looked silly and cheesy (like how other animes get super cheesy about friendship). 
 
Now, every one makes fun of me for ever thinking that this show would suck in the first place. I have spent so much money on this shows merch, and I can't even say how many times I have rewatched this show and read the manga. I think about this series 24/7. 
 
Its funny, inspirational, exciting and sad, but mostly what I love One Piece for is its development. It started off as a very simple anime, where everyone was happy and looking towards their goals and the show was very simple to watch. And then it really developed into something more heartwrenching and complicated- I never would have guessed from the beginning of this series how much I would love the characters and how sad it would be, and how much it would make me cry or accidentally hit my head on the wall behind me numerous times cause I get so excited. And if the animation really bugs you, I promise that the art develops too.  
 
And the best thing is, is that all of these tiny hints have been there since the beginning of the series! It's really great noticing something near the start of the show and then realizing much later on how important that small scene was! 
 
I love One Piece to bits- its funny, sweet and yet still has a dark, sad feature to it all. 10/10.

    DISCLAIMER: I am writing this review on episode 850 so I am not 100% up to date but I still want to write it so here it goes. 
 
I am a sucker for long immersive adventure type stories. Being in a massive world with a lot of things happening is something I absolutely love so this anime was frickin made for me. They are also frickin pirates so what more do you want. No but seriously One Piece is a god send and I don't even believe in god.  
 
I am going to go through the ratings one by one and debunk any reasons why people rate them lower and why I disagree with it. 
 
Story: 
 
Eiichiro Oda is an excelent story writer. The One Piece story is immersive, deep, emotional and in my opinion great in all ways. The most important part seems to be making friends and having strong bonds with people which is something I as an introvert am not in contact with that often so I really do love it. 
One thing I will have to say is annoying as hell is the slow progression. Now that I've watched so many episodes and invested a lot of time I am however emotionally attached to the anime and don't want it to end so the slow progression is something I started to like as weird as that sounds. 
But to make it as unbiased as I can I will elaborate what's the problem. The episodes almost always have a 5 minute recap and later they play 2 flippin intros at the start which results in 8 minutes or maybe more of literally nothing. I tend to skip that and what you are left with is about 15 min of an episode. If you are binge watching then you won't notice the episodes are short as hell but if you are watching an episode every 5 days or however they are released it's probably frustrating. That is why I said I kind of like it being very slow. One extreme example was something that was in theory going to happen in 10 seconds went on for 2 full episodes and some would argue that it was 3 episodes. I didn't really mind that because it was fun throughout. There are a lot of filler episodes and a lot of people say you should skip them but I couldn't disagree more.  
WATCH EVERYTHING YOU WON'T REGRET IT. Watch the movies too they are good. 
 
Art: 
 
A lot of people like to complain that the animation and art is not consistent and while I agree that it is noticeable I don't think it's that bad. It's a long ass series you can't expect them to be so spot on. The animation is never bad it's just inconsistent so whatever.  
The early episodes are very old school after all this is a really old anime so you will just have to deal with it if old isn't your shtick.  
 
Sound: 
 
I unironically listen to One Piece soundtracks quite often. Not the openings and endings. Just the soundtrack. I absolutely adore the soundtrack. Maybe it's because I am emotionally attached to them  but they really calm me down or give me energy. They are amazing. No complaints there imo. 
 
Character: 
 
The characters are integral to the story and they are just as good as the story if not better. Character development is amazing since most of the time you get to see how they are now and how they were before so you really see what's happening and again get immersed and involved. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
This is over the roof I am compelled to say One Piece is my fav anime and it deffo is right now.  
 
Overall: 
 
I cried, I laughed. The anime gives a lot of value to freedom and I am a firm believer in freedom. 
It's an emotional roller coaster and it's one of the greatest trips you will ever have watching a series. I highly recommend watching One Piece with all my heart <3

Inherited will, a man's dream, and the flow of time. As long as man continues to seek out the answer to freedom, these things shall never be stopped.”

If we fight for it it will eventually come <3

    This is a must watch for any fan of anime. While the length can be off-putting, what you gain is worth it.  
 
Reasons to watch: 
. The world building is second to none and it truly feels like your part of it 
. The characters are all well developed and interesting with great backstories  
. The fight scenes are immense and brutal at times 
. The villains are all interesting with their own individual and pretty original backstories and reasons 
. I don't know if it's just me but i love the soundtrack and honestly think the pre-fight hype songs are the best out there 
. And the best bit it that is doesn't seem like it's ending anytime soon :) 
 
I honestly believe when this does finally end it will go down as one of the best animes/ mangas of all time. It's hard to believe there is still so much we don't know about the world and i cannot wait until all my questions are answered.  
 
Despite all this the first few arcs of One Piece can be quite boring and might not draw you in. However, after that i promise it gets more interesting and you won't be let down. Furthermore, it should be noted that the manga is widely considered better than the anime and if you up for the immense read i'd recommend reading it.  
 
Overall, despite all it's imperfections with some arcs, the charm of this anime is so amazing i cannot recommend it enough if you have the time. 
 
Hope this helped :)

    The first thing anyone who wants to watch One Piece should know(And I'm assuming most do) is that it is quite lengthy, currently clocking in at 905 episodes, with no present sign of stopping. (I'm currently at episode 800, myself) 
 
I think it does a fairly good job of fleshing out characters, giving them their own personal strengths and flaws - like the inability to have any sense of direction, even if they can physically see where they're trying to go; or an irrational obsession with treasure. I don't think it really skimps when it comes to the crew; there's several of them so I think it would be easy for some of them to fall to the wayside. 
 
One thing I enjoy the most about One Piece, is that it tends not to take itself overly serious. That's not to say there aren't tense moments, bits of drama, or whatnot, but it tends to skew a little in the direction of lighthearted. I think Luffy is a great main character, because he tends to act a bit goofy, but still has his own personal idea of what he wants to do as a pirate, and where he desires end up in the world.  He's straightforward and doesn't waver on his target - he protects his crew and works to become King of the Pirates. 
 
I'd recommend anyone who wants to try out One Piece, to at least dedicate themselves to watching the first 'Saga' which ends with episode 61. It would give you a real feel for the story, and have time to suck you in or spit you out.  
 
I would warn anyone that wants to watch this; be wary of burning out watching it. I burned out at episode 791. I think if you're going to watch this, you should stop after every Saga or so, and watch something else, even if briefly, to let what you've seen process and give your brain a break. 
 
All in all, One Piece is my favorite Anime to date, after decades of watching them.

    -SPOILER FREE REVIEW- 
This show is just awesome.It is one of very few anime that i gave 10/10 rating.Every new Story Arc of this show amazes me and leave me astonished.Though there are many scenes that are stretched ,this show still doesn't disappoints you. Every new arc is better than the previous ones and the fillers b/w them are pretty interesting too.In every arc and we get to know about mugiwara pirate's crew backstory or character development.Many people doesn't like this show because it is long and give up half way through and say it is boring.In my opinion one  should decide to watch or drop OP after watching upto impel down arc.The comedy in the show is subtle too and they don't usually forget the plot during fillers too.The whole OP story is connected.They don't even forget 'bout characters and small plots from the past and that is the thing I love most about this show.  
I would recommend this show to every one.

    This is my first review of anything ever and it's fitting that it goes to one of my all-time favourite things ever.  
One Piece is what got me into the manga and anime community, by now everyone has heard about its great world building and I'm not going to go into that because there are better and more informative reviews for that.  
I just want to say as a massive one piece fan who is all caught up with the manga is that every anime and manga fan should watch or read one piece, it deserves all the hype it gets. 
 
Now I know that this review is not at all organized but, there is one fault that I think sticks out. In my opinion, Oda writes all the backstories of the characters from the same template. It could be his style or it could be that he just hasn't realised but all the characters follow the same pattern - as a child, the character went through some trauma and now that trauma affects the said character in some way which defines their worldview.

    Plot: Original plot and storyline. It's easy to follow. There're not a lot of fillers. You can always go to animefillerlist.com if you want to see which episodes are fillers.  It'll make you cry and it'll make you laugh. Just watch it. 
 
Art: Don't judge the anime just on the art. I'm not going to lie, it's a little funky in the beginning. The art gets SO good later on in the series. I'm getting tired of people only watching the first episode and then they go and talk shit about the anime. At least, watch multiple episodes.  
 
Sound: The best voice actors ever. The dub voice actors are really good as well. So if you're the kind of person who prefers dub over sub, then you're in good hands. I can't praise the voice acting enough. 
 
Soundtrack: Really enjoyable music. The openings are so hyped.  
 
Characters: I just love the characters. The characters are so funny and just really enjoyable. You really get into the characters. I rarely find any characters in One Piece annoying. And the character development is pretty good. 
 
Overall: A bomb as anime. Don't hesitate, just watch. This anime will make you cry over a damn ship and it will make you laugh. It's just soooooo good.

    I know it seems weird that I gave this anime 10/10 all across the board, but this anime is beyond just a masterpiece. I started watching this in 2012 because at the time I didn't watch much anime, and I was tired of hating on the most popular anime all the time. When I gave it a try, I got hooked so quick. Every arc you experienced an adventure of a lifetime. Every character seemed to have a story inside them, and with the help of Luffy, they could start screaming it out. If you're looking for a new anime with a breathtaking experience at every turn, you have to watch this one. Literally the greatest adventure you'll ever be on.

    First off, I'd like to cover the thing people seem to hate most about this series.  
The art style. Sure, it's a bit goofy at first, but, the type of cartoonish art allows Oda to convey a variety of expressions and emotions. Also, since he's not stuck drawing characters that look entirely human, it allows him to create unique characters, regardless of how odd they look. If you can't handle the art style, read a summary of the first couple of arcs until the art style improves, and believe me, it has made a huge jump. 
 
Overall, art gets an 8/10 for being original 
 
Let's talk about the sound, as long as you aren't watching the dub, you should be fine. It has good opening and closing themes, but Luffy's English voice is TERRIBLE. However, if you're watching the original Japanese show, the characters voices fit rather nicely I feel.  
 
So, overall, sound gets a 7/10 
 
Characters, oh boy. First of all, I absolutely love Luffy, favorite character in anything by far. But, I digress, if you watch the series in it's entirety, you continue to learn more about the characters, and that isn't just limited to the Straw Hat crew themselves, many characters that play a decently sized role have some kind of backstory to go along with them. Oda just makes every character either lovable, or hate able, and I feel he has done a really good job with the development of characters throughout 
 
Characters, 9/10 
 
Now, we move onto story. Sure, it may seem a bit simplistic at first, but the further you go into the anime/manga, the deeper it delves into the story. The fights are cool, and unlike a lot of shounen anime, the coolest fights are not limited the main character, heck, one of the coolest fights in the series is Zoro against one of the members of CP9, but I won't go into that. Also, the anime is not full of filler, as I see most of the negative reviews saying. Most, if not all of the episodes contribute toward important plot points later on, or at the moment of occurrence. 
 
Story gets a 10/10 
 
Overall, I believe that if you can get through the 1st 100 episodes or so, it'll be smooth sailing. The anime itself is extremely well done. It combines action with a healthy amount of comedy and drama, all the while it stays to the plot, and even manages to maintain it's great writing all throughout the series. Personally, it has been and likely will continue to be my favorite anime. I apologize if this review was at all biased, I tried not to be, and I think I did a decent job. 
 
One Piece is a must watch, and if you can't get past the art style, just read summaries of the arcs and watch highlights until the art style begins to improve (which it doesn't take long to do) 
 
Sorry if the review is bad, I just felt I should write this, even though there are plenty of others here :3

    First of all, One Piece has a terrific storyline that becomes more and more absorbing/thrilling/intricate as it progresses. It's simply stunning how well planned and interconnected the entire series is, despite its length. The characters are diverse and, I personally believe, quite lifelike since they cover a broad range of personality types. Also, they have very moving personal histories that make them very relatable. Plus, the sheer fact that the series is 400 eps long means that eventually, the characters end up seeming so familiar to you, they seem like old friends.  
 
Then there's the creativity of the series' plotline and setting. People make the mistake of assuming it's a generic anime in this respect but any fan could tell you that the show covers a marvelous range of different locations (islands built in the sky, prehistoric islands, desert islands, and more) and that it has several very unexpected plot twists and plot conventions the likes of which are hard to find in other shonen anime. The world of the story (including its unique geography and its zany, but thrillingly powerful inhabitants) is remarkably vast and a treat for the imagination. It's not hard at all for a fan to be utterly swept up in it! There are also several interweaving subplots behind the main goal of the show (which is to find the One Piece treasure) that keep the show alive and fresh (as opposed to, say, Naruto's perpetual quest to save Sasuke). Not to mention, at times, it can be quite mature and meaningful in a poignant, though non-melodramatic way. And the comedy can be just plain hilarious!  
 
As for the show's artwork, this is more controversial since some people simply detest it since they usually find it to be too ""childish"". However for fans of the show the artwork is viewed as being unique and, personally, I feel it captures the adventuring, free-spirited air of the story brilliantly. 
 
Now, to more concisely answer your question, I would have to say what ranks One Piece above other long-running series is its quality. It avoids becoming repetitive, constant attention is given to character development, progress in the plot's development (while slow) is continued constantly, the thematic content is varied and meaningful (it deals with all sorts of issues like greed, corruption, even slavery), its fillers are kept to a minimum and are in fact also rather enjoyable, and it maintains its own unique style. 
 
Just as a warning though, some people find that the first arcs of the show are dull (meaning almost the first hundred eps) and, so, conclude that the entire series must be dull. But really it keeps getting better and better (unlike most long-running series that seem to just sort of tail off in their later episodes). Right now, after 400 episodes, we're reaching what almost all fans promise is going to be the most epic arc to date! So you see, it's really the sort of show that improves with age and can captivate any fan. It just might require some patience in the beginning (though I personally loved it right from the start).

    I've written this out before but just because One Piece is long, doesn't make it a literary flaw!! It has never noticeably tried to artificially lengthen the show and the story has a lot more depth to it than on the surface. 
 
Everyone who is not watching One Piece should be watching One Piece. It is nothing short of a work of genius and while it starts slow, it gets progressively better. I was depressed for a while and it's certainly helped me in those hard times like a crutch. 
 
All the characters are interesting, diverse, and have their own development arcs. It's not just the Luffy Show Staring Luffy, every single member of the crew gets time in the spot light and chances to grow as their own character while also developing unique relationships with one another. And that's not even to mention the wealth of side characters not part of the Straw Hat crew, who ALSO get time to steal the stage in their own right, making it a joy whenever they show up again in later storylines. 
 
This extends to every fight the crew gets in being wonderfully creative and unique. Every single member gets to take a part in the fight, none of that DBZ ""Goku and Goku's family is the only one who matters"", even fucking Usopp gets really awesome battles. And for the most part, the storyline isn't just fights all the time that usually shonen mangas delve into but actually has a great story. 
 
The world and setting is also pretty awesome, with some diversity and complexity to the internal politics and cultural lay out, but the best part is there's not really any part of the series where things just stop dead so someone can have a long exposition scene that's boring and trite. Everything plays out very naturally and the audience is able to pick up on how everything works just by watching it occur in front of them. Also Snail Phones. Cuz Snail Phones. 
 
The series is also incredibly funny, but not to the point of losing credibility. Like, there's some cultural differences, but the manga is genuinely funny and WILL make you laugh. It rival MGS in ability to balance goofy comedy that refuses to take ANYTHING seriously, with legit dramatic moments that will make you choke up. 
 
It has been going on for fifteen or so years, and still has about 7 years to finish, but is still a joy to watching and go along with, and even REWATCHING since it has a habit of bringing back up old characters and plotlines that any other show would have long since forgotten and make them suddenly pivotal and important. It rivals Babylon 5 in apparently having all been planned out from the beginning, or at the very least Breaking Bad in winging it to appear as such. 
 
It is honestly a wonderful incredible show, that unfortunately many people will pass over because of the ""anime = genre"" prejudice, but I feel that those who give it a chance will not regret their choice. Dealing with a variety of times from dealing with lost, happiness, while being the One Piece, I know and love, it's been one of the most influential things I've read.

    A subpar adaption carried hard by excellent source material.  Gets especially bad once Toei starts making intentional terrible pacing of an insanely slow 1:1 episode chapter ratio.  OnePace automatically bumps its back to an 8 however, and the manga was a 9 for reference.  I have a much fuller guide for how to properly read and watch One Piece beyond just watching the official anime below. 
 
For some background, I originally started watching One Piece all the way up to Fishman Island before I was even a general anime fan but lost interest until a year ago when I decided to just sit down and binge all of it again, finally finishing my year's journey with chapter 929 yesterday. I've noticed that there are 5 routes to read or watch One Piece with between the manga, anime, and derivative projects. 
 
Manga Routes-generally reads faster (very important for a 900+chapter/800+episode behemoth) and has more bonus material spread throughout 
 
    Official Manga (black and white)-the final route if you want to stay up to date but not necessarily the beginning route especially when there's a Colored Manga route available 
 
    Colored Manga-my most used route personally and what I used to just power through the beginning, a strict improvement over Official (color>B&W) but only extends partially into Whole Cake Island 
 
Anime Routes-generally has higher high moments and is more passively consumed 
 
    Official Sub-generally fine for PART I, since you can skip filler arcs 
 
    Official Dub-see above, for those that jsut prefer all english and no reading 
 
    OnePace-cuts filler AND padding, essential for re-correcting Part II of the anime when Toei goes full scum mode 
 
Unfortunately all of these routes have different lengths with some ending before other parts so there are different paths mix-matching these routes. I've highlighted three paths in particular for those with a preference towards manga or anime as mediums or those that want the absolute best of both worlds. 
 
 
 
MANGA ONLY PATH 
 
    Chapters 001-833: Colored Manga 
 
    Chapters 834+: Official Manga 
 
 
 
MAXIMAL ANIME PATH 
 
    East Blue-Marineford: Official Sub/Dub (skip the fillers, OnePace isn't finished yet here) 
    Return to Sabody-Whole Cake Island (1st half): OnePace Whole Cake Island (second half)+: Official Manga, because OnePace hasn't covered this part yet. 
 
 
 
OPTIMIZED HYBRID PATH (warning: wall of text) 
 
 
PART I 
 
    East Blue Saga-Any route that gets the job done, just to get over the archive panic and start 
 
    Alabasta Saga-Any is fine 
 
    Skypiea Saga-Any is fine, use Official Sub/Dub route's conclusion if you want G8 tho 
 
    G8-Optional good filler arc?! Official Sub/Dub routes only as a result 
 
    Foxy-Colored Manga, its a gag manga arc that gets padded out way too much 
 
    Water 7-An anime route is slightly preferred for density of high moments 
 
    Ennies Lobby-An anime route is slightly preferred for density of high moments 
 
    Thriller Bark-An anime route is favored for musical impact 
 
    Sabody Archipelago-An anime route is favored as an actually good adaption 
 
    Amazon Lily-Colored Manga, really short and anime does nothing for adaption besides making it longer to finish 
 
    Impel Down-An anime route is slightly preferred for density of continuity moments 
 
    Marineford-Offical Sub/Dub slightly preferred for moment/continuity density, as OnePace is not finished recutting this arc 
 
 
PART II: Toei becomes scumbags and start only adapting 1 chapter per episode, making Official Sub/Dub routes inviable, leaving OnePace as the only viable anime route. The Colored manga route is still perfectly viable however. 
 
    Return to Sabody-OnePace AND Official Sub route for brook's concert scene specifically 
 
    Fishman Island-Colored Manga; its a great arc for its themes w/ bad action scenes anyways 
 
    Punk Hazard-OnePace, Law's whole gag works so much better w/ voice acting 
 
    Dressrosa-OnePace OR Colored Manga, its a 50 episode/100 chapter behemoth, just do what you have to do to power through this arc whether it's speed or passiveness 
 
    Zou-OnePace is slightly favored, if only for Brook's song 
 
    Whole Cake Island (1st half) OnePace is strongly favored, between the color and musical numbers of the very colorful and very musical whole cake island 
 
 
PART II.5: You've reached the end of the OnePace route and the Colored Manga Route is long over too and neither update particularly fast (Official Dub route is over too but was already irrelevant). There are only two routes remaining: Official Sub and the Original Manga route. Official Sub still suffers from Toei's greed and Original Manga is the final destination anyways, so I recommend just jumping onto the Official Manga sooner than later. 
 
    Whole Cake Island (2nd half)-Official Manga, color/music isn't worth the Official Sub route's pacing 
 
    Reverie and beyond-Official Manga, it is literally the only route left, welcome to the final destination and now you can be up to date every week too

    While i would without a doubt give manga 10 out of 10, anime just doesn't deserve such generosity.  
You know that something is wrong, then your anime looks much, MUCH better during episode 300 than during ~700. I guess Toei realised that they don't need to pump any money into this, kids will still watch it- so we have a miserably bad animation (ironically, the best animated scenes are these where characters are just talking, any movement, especially backgrounds, looks embarassing at best) and annoying reuse of sound effects... You laughed at CLANG from berserk? One Piece STILL uses Dragon Ball Z sound effects! 
 
Bad animation alone wouldn't be much of a problem, if the story was good, right? And it is- if you look at the entire arc. Single episodes are boring as f*** unless you skip through them.  
Every episodes starts at time of 6:00 and ends at 22:00. Subtract 20s of eyecatcher, another minute of camera slowly moving through ugly backgrounds and another one minute of reused scenes from previous episides and you end up with each episode lasting maybe 14-15 minutes. And even this is stretched as much as Toei can, with dozens of characters reacting to every mc actions and filler fights. 
 
Most episodes cover a single, 18-pages long chapter. Even other long-running series, like Bleach or Naruto, used to cover at least 2 chapters. But i said ""MOST"", because there are some that cover... less. Imagine entire episode based on, let's say 10 pages, that you could read under 8 minutes. Stretched to a full episode! That's a regular OP episode. 
 
Watching one piece without skipping is painfull, but hopefully there are still some fairly good episodes, every now and then (i somehow watched through entire Law's past without skipping a second). Also, the material anime is adapting is outstandingly good, even if this hideous cartoon would suggest otherwise. 
 
Something went really, really wrong with this anime. I mean, it used to be better- not only the animation peaked during Ennies Lobby/Summit War, but also anime used to cover at least 1 chapter per episodes (and sometimes- it's actually enough). But nowadays watching one piece is just exhausting- for example, Dressrosa Arc lasted for 100 chapters in the manga... and 120 in the anime! Whole cake- 80 v 100!  
I simply can't imagine the torture of watching it weekly, in front of tv, for full 30 minutes. I'd forgot what all was about before Dressrosa could end... 
 
But there's a simple explanation to it all- the manga counterpart. Obviously, Eichiro Oda is a god of mangamaking, and each volumes sells in millions. Also One Piece airs on sunday morning, next to a freaking dragon ball and other kid's favourite shows. Of course millions will watch it ANYWAYS, so Toei doesn't have to spend more than, i guess, ""enough"". They do not have to compete with other series. And Toei knows it- they know that if they aired more than 4 episodes of filler in a row, less would watch it (and sadly, some filler were pretty fun). That's why they decided to move at such a slow pace, because even showing one minute of new content is enough to attract millions of people in front of TV... 
 
But hopefully animation slightly increased in recent episodes. But OP anime is still a shadow of its former self.

    I am tired of one piece anime.  
 
The lazy animators, the broken gestures of characters, and the robotic animation in the fight scenes, and mostly the slow story development.  I like one piece, but since its already 2 decades had past, but the story are still in the middle, I'm bored of it and get tired. The author skips the story of the characters that is likable and need to be told like ""Shanks"" mihawk"" reyleigh"" and many more. Its been a decade since they are being introduced in the series but we still cant figure out their origin and backgrounds, we only knew few things about them. As the story goes on, the author keeps adding countless characters and makes you confused (I know some of them are likable), the bad thing is the added characters have given a role that surpass the previous supporting characters. What I mean is, the old characters that has been added in previous arcs are being forgotten and the new characters plays a role that surpass the old characters. 
 
(POWER UPS) 
As we know luffy is a robber man who eat the cursed fruit. He is also the successor of the emperrors haki. The problem is, In the present chapters, He is now able to use different kind of powers, example the ""Fire fist"". How the hell is he able to manipulate fire? . second is the ""4th GEAR"", How the hell is he transformed into a rocket looking thing?  and why the hell he become a spring man? (I cant figure the relation of robber and spring and the rocket looking transformation).  
 
The most thing I hate in the animation is, my favorite characters Nami and  Robin, looks like a old macho men, why the hell they have large nick and broken face gestures? (Damn ""TOEI"" what the fuck are you doing?)  how can you call them a gorgeous lady now that you broke their faces? 
 
I'm really disappointed in this series, I wasted my whole 10 years of life being a fan for this nonsense and endless story of a show. 
 
There's a lot more to talk to, but that is for now, Because  I still hoping for the improvement of the series. 
 
Maybe its time to hold this series for now.

    When I first heard about one piece I was nearly overflown with the hype the fans were giving it, saying it was the best thing ever, that anyone who dares to call themselves an anime fan should at the very least reconsider watching it, or either the haters would complain that this 600+ series has been pushing themselves forward way to long and just need to end already. 
I gave this series a try, evenually I got hooked up so bad, I watched the entire series in just a spawn of 3 months,  
and all I got to say about it is, I absolutely love it.  
don't even doubt about the fact whether you want to watch this show or not, watch this show right now, this instant.  
one piece is literally for anyone out there, children, teens, adults, male, and even female may enjoy it undoubtely. one piece is one of the best shounens out there, and has all his right to earn this title.  
 the writers succeed in knitting this long running story so well together that it just fits perfectly. 
every introduced character plays it's part, everything that happens has a value, may it be momental, huge or even way later in the future of the show.  
this show doesn't understand the concept of exaggerating, may it be of the wacky character personalities, designs, the downright crazy devil fruit powers, wacky islands, inhuman myths and introduces you to crossdressers, mermaids, fishmen and giants in the show like it's the most normal thing ever.  
 
characters:  
the characters in one piece most definitely has to be one of it's strongest points.  
the main characters are so well developed that it's impossible to hate any straw hat pirate.  
from the easy-minded but pure hearted rubber captain ,Monkey D luffy, to the headstrong loyal swordsmen ,roronoa zoro, from the wimp sniper ,usopp who later slowly but surely develops in a dependable and strongwilled crewmember,  
 the characters which are introduced in the spawn of the series surely aren't left out either.  
one piece expands from a variety of all different kinds of characters and backstories which all in all are unique on their own, from the way they speak, laugh, how they behave, their ideals, every character is memorable and they own carry their own value to the evenual story. 
 
art: 
though,  I gotta confess  that I honestly had to get used to the art of one piece at first. 
the mouths were way to weird for me, the females were way to thin, and some features seemed to be rather bad. 
after a few episodes it just eventually stopped bothering me, after you got used to it you don't even know why you would dislike it in the first place. it's just another segment to make one piece more unique and if you're in the story more deeper you end up simply enjoying it.  
I can understand that some people don't have the ability to get used to it, but don't let it bother you one bit. you won't regret it. 
 
Music:  
it ain't yuki kajiura material, but it also isn't necessairy. the music fits in the background of one piece just perfectly, some BGM are memorable and just downright beautiful/epic. 
everytime I listen to the soundtrack used for a sad moment in enies lobby arc I start sobbing again.  
 
enjoyment: 
one piece is one of the best series I have ever watched in my life, out of all the anime I've watched, this most definitely is my favorite. 
it's unique, enjoyable, it makes you push your nose against the screen in the exciting moments, it succeeds to make you sob in the sad moments, 
this series is most certaintly a long one, and hasn't dried out in the least bit, and also won't be up until the very end. 
do you need to watch one piece? hell yeah you do.  
and why: because you're missing out of a whole lot, if at the very least you don't wanna reconsider watching this masterpiece.

    One Piece is story about a boy who wants to be the Pirate King. The boy's name Monkey D. Luffy. On his adventure he finds amazing crew mates with sad pasts. Everyone in Luff's crew also has dreams. To accomplish their dreams they cross the Grand Line, meet people, & fight for their amazing dreams! They all will fight for their dreams until they die! While you watch this anime you shouldn't care about the art, voices, etc. because this anime is an anime that will encourage you to go on with your ambitions, fight for friends & families, and & to NEVER GIVE UP! This is what I know so far & I hope for you watchers to keep watching this anime till the very end.This anime is sad, romantic (if don't understand what that means just watch all of the episodes), funny, exciting, heart breaking, and AMAZING. I am chrischo718 and I approve this message!!!

    Without going into spoilers too much I will give my review of One Piece. 
 
Characters and Story 
The story revolves around the main protagonist Monkey D Luffy who aims to become the king of the pirates. And along with him will be the other Straw Hat members who you will meet as you go along the series. The main cast for One Piece is pretty good as they have unique personalities from each other as well as their own fighting styles, powers and abilities. They also got some good backstories which can make you feel and care about them. What they do lack however is development because Luffy does not really have any throughout the series even though he does have a very likable personality and the others only seem have quite a bit of development within the arcs they are introduced in. The side characters you meet within the arcs are good as they may have some good backstories and do develop. The villains are not bad either since they can have an interesting personality and backstory however they kinda lack something which makes you believe whether they actually pose as a real threat to the straw hats and I should state that there isn't a lot of deaths in One Piece which lowers the sense of danger a bit. As for the story it does really well as it has a deep story with many subplots to them which relates to the world building which is also great that comes from within the arcs with the islands they explore as they also go into some themes. Plus there are not a lot of plot holes or inconsistencies so it is well written for the most part. Now if I were to belittle One Piece's story I could say that there is this plot formula which goes like this ""Luffy and crew goes to island, they become friends with a few residents there, have a decent understanding of what goes on within the island, villain starts wreaking havoc, Luffy and crew beat the villain and happy ending, then they go to a new island, rinse and repeat"". However that does not change the fact that One Piece has a great plot. Also I should mention that One Piece does have slow pacing so within the grand scheme of things, there might not be that much progression as the anime usually does 1 chapter per episode and it is apparently halfway through the story although I believe its more 2/3. 
 
Action 
One Piece has some pretty nice fights and the better ones usually come from Luffy, Zoro and Sanji. The animation usually moves fines for it and has some good sound effects for it. Also there is a huge variety of abilities within One Piece and they can get pretty creative with the devil fruits, haki and other techniques as well as some fighting styles. I wouldn't say they have the best fights in anime but that's all subjective and go around with it how you will. 
 
Comedy 
The comedy in One Piece is very good as the show does have this overall lighthearted tone which mainly comes from its comedy and it goes well. I also would like to say that One Piece does well to balance the tone between comedy and seriousness. 
 
Sound 
The soundtrack for One Piece is solid because it really does make it feel like a pirate theme adventure. So don't expect some rock or techno within One Piece's soundtrack. The sound effects for One Piece are great with the attacks, motion, etc. 
 
Art style and Animation 
At first the art style would seem very childish and silly, however you will eventually get use to it and even start to appreciate it since the art style is unique and anime for the most part has a similar art style. The animations are fine, don't expect something like Madhouse quality animation because since its a very long series, they won't have enough budget to make all the episodes top notch so its fine for what it is. And it can be very good in some scenes. 
 
Overall Conclusion 
One Piece is a very good series that is worth getting into. Its not perfect and has some flaws but the since there is a lot to like in One Piece, the positives outweigh the negative so they won't be much of a bother for the overall experience. Although I would say it is better to marathon the series rather than watch it weekly as I have stated the pacing is slow so not much would happen if you are watching weekly.

    One Piece is one of the greatest things I've ever experienced. it is without doubt my favorite anime/manga. It has amazingly interesting and cool characters and a seemingly simple but grand plot. One of the things that I love about it are the characters. Some are just quirky but  many others are very well written and interesting. One Piece has an extensive variety of good characters that just make the whole One Piece universe even better than it already is. I could go for hours thinking about different battles that could have happened in different arcs between different characters that would have completely changed the series. My favorite character is Doflamingo and he is really cool because he is crazy and he just doesn't care about anything but his goals which is really awesome.  
Another great thing about One Piece is the artwork. I like the artwork because it is a very good at most parts. The first 500 episodes have good art but after that it gets kinda messed so I would recommend reading the manga after that point.  
Another great aspect of One Piece is its music. When something is going down with Luffy a really epic song will play and it will get you really hyped for the coming battle. Just thinking about these songs gives me chills because of what was going on when they were playing. It also has very good openings and endings that are amongst the best I've heard. 
One Piece's story is seemingly simple: Luffy is searching for the One Piece. It is not as simple as it seems though. Each arc has its own unique theme, appeal, and characters. each arc immerses you into that islands world and keeps you very entertained. Also each arc builds up on the last one to make a very grand story. 
With all these things combined it makes One Piece have something special that I have yet to see in anything else anime, TV series, and movies.

    At the risk of losing all my readers, let's start with some math. Four hundred and fifty episodes, roughly thirty minutes each, comes out to 13,500 minutes, with some generous rounding. There are 1,440 minutes in a day, meaning that would take over nine days to catch up to the latest episode of One Piece if you start from episode one and never sleep. It takes some extreme dedication to get that far; such dedication that, in fact, it should pointless to ask me what I thought of the series. The numbers can't lie: I loved it. I have dedicated half a year of my free time between work and High School to this anime, and it was consistently one of the highlights of my week. I don't think you should just go watch One Piece; I think you should go watch One Piece right now. I have joined a large chorus of fans and writers online who will all tell you with the zeal of a cultist that this series is awesome. This is the creme de la creme of shounen series, it has reached the zenith of what anime can do several times over, if you even think you can make the time to see this, you must at least try. And our voices are so loud and so strong... 
 
... that a perfectly natural reaction from someone who hasn't seen this series, or has seen some of it and didn't care to continue, is skepticism. After all, I'm talking about a cartoon about a rubber pirate who acts like he's five years old. It's essentially just another shounen fighting series for 11-year-olds; it hardly seems like the Citizen Kane of anime. Hyperbole in the name of exuberance can have the odd effect of putting people off, and spending over hundred hours on anything requires a lot of exuberance. That skepticism is understandable, especially since explaining what makes this series work might not sound all that different from why people enjoy Bleach, Naruto, or similar series. 
 
So let's start with something we can all agree on- visually and conceptually, One Piece is a unique series. Anime is littered with ghost hunters, ninjas and teenagers endowed with mystical powers inspired Eastern mythology, but Oda hit on something special when he came up with the idea of 17th century pirates with superpowers. And that's really the beginning of One Piece's creativity. For such a long series, a constant flow of creativity is a must, and Oda has generally shown that he is up to the challenge. One of the conceits of the series is that each island the characters travel to is a strange world unto itself. One island could be under the thumb of tyrannical mermen, another a mystical island where it always snows, and still another where all the plants and animals have grown to be really l o n g. It's wonderful world building, but not in the sense that it's carefully crafted like Fullmetal Alchemist. It's more like a child's glee at making things up as she goes along. Unlike most shounen series, where superpowers and wonders have some kind of pseudoscientific explanation, the series follows an unrelenting dream logic that it doesn't explore very deeply. Why does eating a fruit that gives you superpowers also mean you can never swim? It just does, dammit. It's a refreshing change, and it keeps the sense of wonder intact for many episodes. 
 
Take the superpowers our heroes wield. Luffy is a kid who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, and now is a rubber man: literally, a man made of rubber. That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in One Piece, it's a potent power that leads to some crazy, awesome, and crazy awesome fights. He can take a lot of damage, and since his rubber fists and feet can stretch to huge lengths, he can give as good as he takes. One of the main villains, Buggy, ate the Chop Chop Fruit, so he can divide his body however he pleases. And there are many more, and for over three hundred episodes, we are constantly introduced to wave after wave of new characters with strange abilities that range from the silly to the sinister, and, sometimes, are even both at the same time. And one of the small delights of the series is that when our heroes get strong by developing their powers, they break from the shounen formula of ""defeat - training - victory."" No, the characters develop their skills on the fly- they make it up as they go along. This burst of creativity lasts so long and is so strong, that when the anime does finally bring back some old characters beyond the core cast, it's a bit of a disappointment. 
 
Of course, for the series to be any kind of success, these characters would have to be better than your garden variety heroes. They'd have to be characters you could care deeply about and watch develop beyond what crazy things their powers do. Luffy can't become the Pirate King by himself, so he brings along a ragtag group of people he befriends in his travels. Though the small crew keeps adding new characters, there's roughly five core members: Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While you could safely describe each of these characters by whatever their particular kook is- Sanji is the cook who loves the ladies, Nami is the domineering navigator who loves money, Zoro is the samurai swordsman who wields three blades and sleeps all the time, Usopp is the sniper who tells outrageous lies- but that doesn't quite do them justice. They develop and grow close to each other, reinforcing the anime's central theme of friendship. The cast is probably One Piece's greatest strength, because when the story lags and things slow down, it's still a pleasure to spend time with the Straw Hats. I would hold them up to any of the great crews of anime, from Lupin, Urusei Yatsura, or Cowboy Bebop. And save a kind word for the villains: after all, what's a good hero without one or a dozen great enemies? They are all hateful bastards who deserve to get their face smashed in. It's a delight to see it happen every time. 
 
The concept of One Piece is very open ended; ""Boy tries to be the Pirate King"" leaves a lot of room open for how that could happen. Appropriately enough for a series about a long odyssey, the series has been leisurely working its way towards an ending. So far, the anime has covered about five major story arcs, some of which have several mini arcs. It starts out with short, mostly silly stories that are quickly resolved, but as we get to know the characters more and the world opens up, it gradually, confidently builds towards high drama with some epic storylines. Two examples stand out: the Alabasta Arc and the CP9 Saga. The Alabasta Arc starts shortly after the core of the crew is assembled and spans over fifty episodes. It's a big, meaty storyline with conspiracies and secret identities, rebellions and politicking, and has one of the most effective villains I've ever seen in anime. It's only topped many episodes later, with the epic CP9 Saga. This one spans a hundred episodes and is a more emotional viewing, and it's where the Straw Hats show the most growth. 
 
I really mean it when I say One Piece has the elusive ""spirit of anime."" As a series, the serialized storytelling has a lot of impact that builds from episode to episode, and shows extensive planning for arcs a couple hundred episodes in advance. It's one of the few series that can only be realized in animated form, and it has so much impact because of its extreme length. And it may be nowhere near finished. When recently asked how close the manga was towards completion, which the anime sticks very close to, Oda estimated that he was about halfway finished. And while he's known to be a jokester in interviews, I don't know of any reason not to take his answer at face value. And while recent episodes haven't quite lived up to the same level as earlier, since Oda has started to dip more often into the pool of Shounen Jump cliches, it says a lot that my reaction to this news was happiness. 10/10

    Note:This review is based on the original Japanese dub not the English dub. 
 
This is one of those shows that require no introduction but just in case you do need one. The show centers around the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and his crew and the adventures that they go on so that they can each accomplish their dreams and goals. It is one of the many few shonen anime that can keep my attention and keep me engaged and excited for the next episode.   
 
Story 9/10 
The story might seem very simple on the surface, but as you get further into the anime, the show begins to show layers with many themes of friendship, trust, loss, and many different things that drive the show. The story really has many layers that can't necessarily be explained by words,so i'll leave judgment of story up to the viewers, but in my opinion the story isn't the only thing that makes this show amazing.  
 
Characters 10/10 
I believe that One Piece has an amazing diverse cast of characters with most if not all characters being able to be well developed in the amount of time that they get. All the characters are memorable, lovable, and outright very well developed. Enough so that they make me actually care for each character that is introduced. The characters truly make up the world and really push the enjoyment factor so high I wish I could rate it higher.  
 
Art 7/10 
Due to this being a weekly shonen show with many many episodes the animation is bound to have its ups and downs, but when the animations shines it really shines and when it doesn't, it shows.  
 
Sound 9/10  
The music and voice acting of this show is amazing. I can't tell you how many times I will hum one of the many opening songs or instrumental pieces while I'm outside. There are some times when I don't really like some of the voices of some characters but that is just from my own personal opinion.  
 
Overall 10/10 
There are some flaws that I have not mentioned but I believe that this show overshadows all those flaws with it's amazing world, fantastic cast of characters, and amazing storytelling. I would recommend One Piece to anyone. One Piece really is in my opinion a truly amazing anime.

One Piece is the first anime that I really liked. Yes, its your typical shounen anime with shounen tropes but at least it tries to be somewhat unique (unlike Naruto, Bleach ,or DBZ). Not in a Generic School Setting YES! (Fuck anime that are set in schools), A series about Pirates (Original). I am tired of anime with ninjas/samurai (though they are really cool). I am tired of anime that has a student main character (eww) and luckily I found One Piece. 
 
Story and Setting: 9/10 
Its not original but One Piece has one of the best, if not the best storytelling, in anime. It is formulaic but the way every single arcs are told are very compelling and unique that it feels different to your typical shounen. It is also connected to one another (Even G8, a filler arc was well connected). The flashbacks are all well done almost have of One Piece flashbackas are in my Top 10 Flashbacks (for now at least). The mysteries induced in the story are very intriguing and just mindblows the hell out of me. For a shounen, One Piece is somewhat unpredictable. The worldbuilding/setting is just top-notch. Oda is just super imaginative and creative. Easily the best part of One Piece. It may go very slow at times (especially at weekly basis) but the interest is never lost. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
All characters are likeable (except for few). The main villains in the series are all well done. They are intimidating, have awesome backstories that make them more interesting. The sense of danger with them is really evident. The main characters are all interesting, especially on how they develop throughout the story. Overall they are very likeable, relatable and interesting. 
 
Overall I consider One Piece to be the second best SHOUNEN (behind Hunter x Hunter) anime I have watched (if FMA:B is shounen then One Piece is 3rd).

    ""If I get reincarnated.... I wanna become a clam."" - Monkey D. Luffy"" 
 
I often see people pushing away and refusing to try One Piece because it's ""mainstream"" and very long. I am sad to see such a nice series being refused just because it's popular, it's long, the art, or because of the dubbed version.  
 
Story: With Pirates, superpowers, giants, and many more things, it is different from what I've seen in other anime. Sure, there are many other series about Pirates, or superpowers, but this combines everything into one long series. Sad moments that make you want to cry, some moments you cry of laughter, anxiously waiting for the next episode to see how everything plays out. 
 
Art: The art of One Piece has always been nice. It is bright and lively. Beautiful details, beautiful backgrounds, etc.. 
 
Sound: I am not one to overly enjoy the soundtrack on an anime, but One Piece was different. Each opening have been upbeat, refreshing, and nice to listen to. It was also nice when they doubled the beginning, and took the ending song out. The Japanese voice acting fits perfectly for each character you meet throughout the series. 
 
Character: You meet many, many characters in One Piece. Every one you meet, minor, major, enemies, friends, they all have their own style. Most characters will make an impact, and you will be remembering them a while after they leave.  
 
Enjoyment: I enjoy each and every episode, anticipating new episodes every Sunday. This show comes with lots of heart-warming moments, many surprises, and hilarious moments. 
 
Overall: One Piece was a very enjoyable series. I would recommend to anyone who likes action, fights, and humor.

    One Piece is awesome! One of my most memorable moment was in the early episodes when Luffy got hypnotized and he started yelling in anger, and I thought the voice was so perfect absolutely hilarious.  Thats how I got hooked.   
 
My main reason why I like One Piece so much is simply because there is so many episodes.  Since I was new to One Piece early december of 2007, I did alot of watching in my spare time. It felt great, every episode I would get more attached and I didnt want it to stop. I'm kinda heartbroken having to wait a week for a new episode, since i fell in love watching 20 episodes a day. 
 
I like the fact one piece has everything, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Romance, Mystery, Drama, Suspense and SAKE! 
 
One piece is brilliant.

    Well One Piece is my most favorite anime. 
I waited this anime to be release every week with no delay, course to display how i like this anime. 
Cause even though the story is super-duper long running the story line were all connected. 
and what's more wonderful were the how the characters improving to become the best.  
Not just the characters are the one whose improving, even the drawings that put here were improving to. 
from plan 2d to amazing anime. 
So I rate this anime perfect. 
 
I think this anime is should be a ""default anime to be liked"" 
 
But why the one piece episode list here were outdated. 
by the time i write this review it should be episode 722, yet its still on ep. 715. 
Gosh...

    Let me just start off with saying this: if you need 750+ episodes and your story isn't even halfway over, you're a s*** writer. NO EXCUSES ODA. I've invested sooooo much time into the series but I'll be damned if I don't some day get a time machine so take it all back and do something productive with my life. 
 
Story: 2/10 - it's so ridiculously repetitive you'll want to cry. Protagonists go to island, island has some shit going on and the straw hats have to basically destroy the entire underground criminal organization of each freaking island, whether they just be lowly criminals terrorizing the city or the entire government of the island is corrupt. I understand that the Straw hats are the ""good guys"" but do they really have to overthrow the monarchy of every freaking island they land on I mean Jesus Christ. 
 
Characters: 3/10 - Each character has some tragic backstory and seem important until they just fade into the background of the straw hat crew because of Oda's complete inability to add any sort of profound depth to his characters. They are all the same as day 1, and they cling to the same annoying cliches even after they've been burned to the ground. Hey you know how brook is a skeleton? Ya let's make him say 50 million skull jokes it's not like those got old after the second time. Hey you remember how bad Zoro was with directions for the first 100 or so episodes? No? Well now he randomly can't walk straight without getting lost. Franky became considerably more lame after the time skip, personality and design wise, and as for the rest of the straw hats they are just ""OK"".  
 
Drama/realisim: (SPOILERS) -100/10 - Alright, do you guys remember when that bird dude took a f***ing nuke to the face and walked it off like it was nothing? That was pretty cool. Or how about when Doflammingo shot the living s*** out of trafalgar law after beating the crap out of him and piercing his chest multiple times and then we see him just a few episodes later with just a few scratches and bruises? Or how about when Jimbe got his f***ing organs obliterated by akainu and then lived to tell the tale like it was nothing? What about when Robin blew up igoram's ship in a HUGE pillar of fire and he returned to alabasta and we never even got an explanation as to what happened, he was just fine! Has a bomb even killed a single person in the series yet? Probably not, and that's pretty impressive considering taking a bomb to the face is like a daily ritual to these people. No matter who you are, civilian or hero; you will inevitably get blown up and be perfectly fine at some point in the series. What the f*** Oda, are all of your characters made out of adamantium or something? Since we know that Oda's a lil b**** who never kills anyone if it doesn't progress the story, this leads to a lot of ""Fake"" drama in the series. We know that even though that dude just got his face shot in by the evil guy, he's gonna be a-okay. This becomes downright insulting after the 500th time it happens. I know it's really only natural to worry about the safety of your friends after they've just been curb stomped into oblivion, but since no one ever dies in series, it makes you not care. This is not drama, it's just an overused cliche that the writers still think they can milk and get away with and it's lazy. 
 
sound: 5/10: nothing exceptional about it but it's okay. 
 
animation: 2/10: it sucks.  
 
Conclusion: If I could go back in time and tell younger me to just stick a fork in the outlet instead of watching this show, I would do it in a heartbeat. Do not recommend, would rather have robin gouge eyes out while nami repeatedly sticks me with the clim-atacck while brook tells more more stupid skeleton jokes until I die.

    (No spoilers contained, and sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language + i'm still amateur on writting reviews) 
 
One Piece is one of the most popular anime/manga series. But i have to say that the manga is way better than the anime for sure. Not because of the few filler episodes, but for the slow pacing, which became more obvious in the recent years and the mediocre animation. But let's go further. 
 
Story: 9 
The story is about Luffy who wants to become the king of pirates. He and his nakama, sail across the Grand Line to fulfil their dreams/goals.  The story is simple, BUT you will see thousands of characters, different events, battles, sad-epic-happy moments. And that is what makes One Piece story more unique than other shounen series. There are some filler episodes, but it is a small amount of them. 
 
 Art: 7 
Despite the very mediocre animation, the art is good and it fits One Piece.  There is no CGI, and the animation does get better throughout the series, but still, for the year of 2015, the animation is like being in 2003.  Also, compared to the manga, the animation is childish. Anyway, the art is unique again, but here the unique is not that good. 
 
Sound: 8 
The voice actors fit perfectly every One Piece character. The backround music also fits the atmosphere, and the content of the soundtrack is big. It rarely uses some soundtracks, and some of them can be listened in almost every episode. It's not the best content of soundtracks you'll hear, but they are the best for One Piece. 
 
Character: 10 
This is what makes One Piece one of the best series of all time. Unique characters with their own backstories, awesome villains, both the main and secondary characters are amazing, and the secondary characters support the series in a great way. The motivations of the villains and their backstories will give you the thrills. Plus, the character develpoment of the main characters throughout the series is amazing. New fighting techinques, new relationships etc.. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
There are definetely many episodes ( currently there are almost 720 episodes) and sometimes there is some low pacing( especially in the past 2-3 years) and many of the arcs are huge (like 40+ episodes) but the story NEVER gets boring. 
 
Overall: 8 
If you are a shounen fan, then One Piece is for you. Maybe not the best shounen anime out there, especially if you don't like an anime with so many episodes and somekind of childish content ( almost no blood in scenes where in the manga there is blood) but still, a popular anime with many fans. It is my favourite anime, but definetely not the best i've watched. By the way, don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that One Piece is for children, it's just that many scenes are censored, for no reason. 
Thank you for reading!

    To tell you my truth all i can say is this is the kind of anime that takes its time to tell you the story, it really wants you to understand whats going on and not miss any detail of whats going on. One of the main characters is luffy he is the kind of person who enjoys almost everything and is laid back but somehow is really serious and if one of his friends get in danger he will risk it all to save them. All the characters get there time to shine too and they all get stronger over the story's time line that is really the best thing of this anime i enjoy. This is my first review so it isn't going to be that long or great but this is truly what i think of this anime ;)

    Before we begin, I would like to say that One Piece is an amazing series, I really love it. The anime had it's moments but the majority of the show was a drag. 
 
One Piece is a series well deserving of it's praise, but it's been tainted by the horrible 4Kids, not to mention the anime adaptation isn't even that good. 
 
Story-One of the most enjoyable parts of One Piece, is the story it tells, the adventures and many unique islands the Straw Hat Crew travel. It's entire universe is unique and interesting from interesting designs in it's universe and even carries it on to it's characters. (Sadly there are quite a few females who tend to look alike though) 
The world of One Piece is amazing, the world building aspect is another thing One Piece shines in. 
 
Art-This one I'm not too sure about the art looks okay, until later on in the series the art gets better. The thing that holds this back is the animation. It's so poor considering it's the best selling manga of ALL TIME. This is Toei Animations fault. It feels so sluggish, and the fight scenes sometimes are at least decent. I don't have any idea what Toei is thinking, or doing with the budget for a popular series like One Piece, but the animation is pretty bad. 
 
Sound- The voice actors for the series are good and match the characters well, and bring emotion to the story. (I don't recommend the english Funimation dub though some characters voices are okay, but others aren't good. The original japanese is better) 
The sound effects are cheap though and don't sound good. Yet another complaint. 
 
Characters-Another aspect of One Piece that is very well done. The characters, even the minor ones are really enjoyable. They each have their own personalities and their own development and fleshed out backstories. One huge example of this is the character Senor Pink. He's not important to the story nor does he appear besides a few chapters in an arc. Yet the characters are fleshed out and have their own relationships with characters across the series and experiences with them, backstories and everything isn't a pain to go through, except in the anime adaptation. The anime makes experiencing One Piece extremely slow. 
 
Enjoyment-Oh I enjoyed One Piece so much, but sadly the anime's HORRIBLE pacing makes the experience a pain in the ass. I did enjoy the series at first it wasn't too bad, but it just steadily got worse. REALLY bad. I do have a decent tolerance level for this, but this...it was just too much. It was slow, not to mention at some points the animation was bad and slow, which didn't help keep my eyes glued to the show. 
 
Verdict-One Piece is amazing. However this anime adaptation is not. It's painfully slow, the animation is definitely on the lower end of the scale considering it's the bestselling manga of all time, though it has redeeming qualities, I really liked some of the OP's which ironically some openings had better animation than the show itself, and the show had it's moments which I actually enjoyed, but a few moments of a 800+ series? I'm sorry that's not enough to redeem this anime. I really recommend the One Piece manga so much. It is by far one of my favorites, but this anime adaptation isn't good.

    One Piece is the legendary treasure said to be of unimaginable value. 
 
It was said to be hidden somewhere deep in the Grand Line, presumably on the last island, Raftel, by the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed, he announced to the world that this great treasure could be claimed by anyone who could reach it, thereby starting the Great Age of Pirates. 
No one except the surviving members of the Roger Pirates actually knows where and what the great treasure is. The most popular theory is that they hid it on Raftel, the final island of the Grand Line. 
 
Given the recurring theme that a treasure is merely something of great personal value (e.g. Luffy's hat) and that Roger, like Luffy, did not value money or gold, One Piece may be nothing more than an item Gol D. Roger valued. In Buggy's flashback to his days as a member of the Roger Pirates, he discussed with Shanks the meaning of a treasure, and he found that all the crew shared the same views regarding personal value.[1] 
 
The closest the Straw Hat Pirates have ever come to finding out the nature of One Piece was during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc when Usopp tried to ask Silvers Rayleigh about it. However, Luffy stopped him on the grounds that learning about it from someone else would defeat the purpose of their adventures and that becoming the Pirate King would have little merit if he already knew anything about One Piece.[2] 
 
After decades of speculations and doubts, the treasure's existence was confirmed by Whitebeard with his last breath. He mentioned that ""a grand battle will engulf the entire world"" and ""the world will be shaken to its core"" when One Piece is found.[3]

    Right off the bat One Piece was not a series I was interested in. I found the art really bizarre, the amount of episodes off-setting, the slow pace of the story to deal with, and quite honestly the voice actor for Luffy annoyed the the heck out of me! However, after devoting my time to watching 650+ episodes of this magnificent series, a love I've never had for any other anime series has developed. I have given this series 7/10 even though is it by far one of my favourite series because it is not without its flaws. 
 
Story: 8/10 
One Piece is by-far one of the most developed story lines I have ever witnessed conveyed through anime. The thing about it that places it above most other series is that we have a plain goal given to us at the beginning of the story that has maintained its focus throughout the entire series so far. It is a very straight-forward series, and the idea of the 'treasure' being at the end of the Grandline makes the whole series flow. What's more is that from this goal, more goals start to string off and in the end we have a story that has created a magical world of adventure. What I like to tell people when I suggest One Piece is to imagine the dream to become the Pirate King a straight line, and from this imagine every side-story (and there's A LOT!) pulling off from this line and developing its own line. It sounds completely confusing, but the story as a whole is fabricated to have a nice and easy-to-follow flow that still has plenty of room for surprise! Only the most thought-out story lines can maintain this flow.  
 
Needless to say, the anime is an adaption from the manga and as such it has its flaws. At times important hints given within the manga to help develop the story line go without animation. Which doesn't seem like a big issue, but overall it gravely lacks the mind blowing development to which the manga has. Furthermore, filler episodes tend to be the most bizarre arcs I have ever seen. There has been one or two filler arcs that has fitted completely well into the story and I would've thought they were canon; but in saying this the series also offers the most absurd filler ideas - and this accounts for about 80% of all filler arcs in the series. Some of the filler arcs are extremely painful to watch through. Overall, the general story line of One Piece is extremely thought out and planned, but due to anime adaption it has it flaws and therefore I give the story an 8/10. 
 
ART - 6/8 
Straight up, one of the reasons why I was hesitant at first to begin One Piece was due to the art style. This is very common among anyone who comes across the series, and while some people might push past it, others may not overcome it, and others will completely avoid the series. I'm very picky when it comes to the art style of a series, and if I don't like it I will lack enjoyment for it as a whole. In saying this, One Piece has been probably one of the only series that I have learnt to love. After avoiding the series for years, I only attempted it out of boredom and even then I wasn't completely thrilled about watching it due to the art style. It's very different from everything else I enjoy, and sort of seemed off-putting. I'm telling you now - at least attempt to watch the series for a good run and see how you adapt to it. Most One Piece fans will tell you they disliked the art style at first also; however it's truly something you grow to love. After 600+ episodes, I couldn't imagine such a series full of adventure with another art style. The art style is what makes One Piece. 
 
To make it clear, I am not giving art a 7/10 for the general art style of the series, but rather because of how the series has been animated. Anyone who knows Toei (the animation studio) comes to understand that they tend to cut corners - even for a big time anime like One Piece. The art can be super sloppy, and poorly done to the point that it becomes laughable. Scenes that should have spectacular artwork are not given the detail to really bring out what the scene should encompass. Despite Toei's faults, all in all the series has a unique art style that sets it afar from the rest. Either you'll love it or you hate it - and however that may evolve depends upon the watcher. All I can say in this regard is the art style might surprise you. It did for me. 
 
SOUND - 10/10 
The sounds and music in One Piece is one of my favourite things about the series. When asked whether someone should watch the anime or read the manga, I tell them they should do both despite the faults of the anime. The reason why is because I feel like the music, voice characters, and so on are so well done in this show that it really adds to the series as a whole for me. I could listen to all the openings in one day. Many of the songs in One Piece brings back memories for me, and a sense of nostalgia. All the songs are enjoyable, and will have you singing out the words in no time. They fit the atmosphere of the series - that being one of adventure and nakamaship. 
 
The choice voice actors (namely in regards to the Japanese sub) is extremely well done. Personally for me all the characters fit their voices! One thing One Piece fans love to laugh at is the unique laughs created for each characters - which I will promise you you will probably try it in private yourself! Like I stated before, at the beginning of the series Luffy's voice annoyed me. As I got more into the series, I became attached to it and couldn't enjoy Luffy's voice as anyone else. The voice actors are able to bring out the character's personality through their skills - which is why I tell people that it's worth it to watch the anime. 
 
CHARACTER - 9/10 
For an expanding world of wonder comes with the challenge of characters. To have such a large set out, to have too few characters introduced would make the series feel empty and not lively enough. To have too many you risk characters who need development to be left under-developed. Unlike many other animes, the layout for One Piece is extremely large - that being basically the WHOLE WORLD. Even so, each character is given the attention and detail it needs. Minor characters are given minor development, and major characters (tend) to be given major development.  
 
Overall you can break the characters up in the series into several categories of importance: major, semi-major, minor and background characters. Those who are major being the crew, those being semi-major meaning the reoccurring characters who had the spotlight in a particular arc, minor being characters who were given detail in the slightest, and background characters being just that. It's a large field to cover, so the development has to be precise for it to be effective. Even so, characters are usually given the necessarily development to make you appreciate them. In particular the crew - all with their interesting and differing back stories - have each their own struggles and goals they wish to achieve. For each character it's a long run of endurance and change - and watching the process of each of these lovable characters becoming the people they want to be - whether slowly or quickly - is truly a journey. Despite this, it is wrong to say all characters in the crew are given the rightful amount of development they deserve. Some of the crew mates tend to be given the spotlight more so than others, and as such they are portrayed as lacking in that area. Needless to say, to say these crews aren't developed at all is also wrong. 
 
One thing I find admirable about the series is how so many differing and sometimes conflicting personalities are portrayed throughout the series - and how they develop not just individuality but between each other. Nakamaship is greatly emphasized within the series, and you'll be able to see how characters (mainly in the crew) interact with each other and form relationships. As the series progressed I found myself loving particular friendships between particular characters - think Zoro and Sanji, or the coward trio! It is extremely hard for any writer/author/etc to effectively develop characters in these areas, and when it happens recognition deserves to be given. 
 
Another cool thing I find interesting about the characters is how they are developed from real-life people. Most characters in One Piece of some importance you will find their roots into bigger inspiration in real life i.e. for example Mihawk from Dracula, or Blackbeard obviously from the legendary pirate Blackbeard. Of course these should be recognized to the manga's author, Oda; however, needless to say I believe the anime has done a great job in adapting them and portraying them how they should be. Thus I have given this area a 9/10. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 8/10 
My enjoyment for the series tends to be lacking due to one issue: pacing. All the other cons are vastly overcome by the pros; however sometimes the pacing becomes unbearable. Having watched the anime first all the way to episodes 500-600 before I picked up the manga, the pacing never really got to me. It was there, without a doubt, and my first experience with the anime can tell you it took me a year to have the willpower to get past the first 20 episodes. This pacing is only emphasized once you start comparing it with the manga, and it gets to the point where you you may not be able to watch episodes without thinking about how it was paced within the manga - which greatly affected my enjoyment for the series. No doubt One Piece would be a large anime regardless of pacing, but needless to say the ratio of episode to chapter has certainly pushed the limits of episodes. 
 
While pacing remains an issue for me, I still believe the pros I have had for the series as a whole have provided me with one of the best anime experiences I have ever had. This series is definitely not without flaws. Some areas lack, but in saying this other areas shine. It's entirely up the individual experience on whether the cons over weigh the pros, or vise via; but personally the pros have given me an entirely fantastic experience that the cons simply can't take away. My enjoyment for this series is undeniable. 
 
OVERALL - 7/10 
While this rating may not seem good and may reflect that One Piece is not a masterpiece as a whole, please remember I am simply a fan who has taken into account the problems One Piece has. One Piece - regardless of the cons I have reasoned out here - is one of the most memorable series. It is not for everyone, but I emphasize that it is not a series that you should dismiss without trial. The adaption isn't always on point, and things can be done better, but I adore this series and I hate seeing people passing it by due to silly reasons.

    I don't think everyone can like One Piece. But I'm sure of one thing, that people who like it will think this one is the best ever!  
For me, I pray it never ends, never ever because I think it's a life style. I feel they're alive, real ppl :) Because all the characters are so real -although it's impossible to have a stretching friend- and this show isn't in a hurry to tell its story to us, lets us have all the fun freely. 
It shakes me everytime I watch a new episode. I would be the happiest person ever if I really had a friend like Luffy.  
I love every little thing about it. I don't want to talk about technical details or music or manga drawings etc. I am just telling you this is a masterpiece! I want to believe the impossible becomes real with these guys :) 
God bless Eiichiro Oda :) and I will be watching it in every week of my life thanks to him :)

    One Piece is one hell of a piece of anime! It has adventure, Action, Comedy, Emotions, .. almost everything. It is a kind of anime after which after watching you will love pirates and aim for a life with piracy (umm a good piracy) well there are always good and bad in the world. 
The only problem i find with this anime is that it is a little slow. But the story and character portray are just awesome! The way characters are shown in this series is apt as it makes it more towards the unrealistic pirate world, Superstitions of the seas and their stories. 
It is an ultimate series with almost everything. There are very few fillers in this series; 1-2 episodes per 100 maybe. So the story progresses a little slowly. But trust me , you are gonna enjoy it a lot !! You might start your own kaizoku-club after watching this superb series.

    Is it useful to describe One piece? Its just one of the master piece of this kind of manga. 
At the beginning the art can be difficult to come in. But when your are in the story you can not stop to watch the anime. 
The story start slowly but everything become definitely more exciting when they come to the great road. It began to love this manga at this moment. 
 
If you want to start this anime be patient. At the moment when I write there are around 500 episodes!!!

    One piece is a great shounen series. Some people might wonder why I put the score so low. We are talking about the anime here thats why. At first the animation was fine but later on after the new world it became terrible. Pacing is too slow and the animators are lazy. I would have given early one piece anime a 6 or a 7 but overall its not that good. I still recommend the anime because at times some scenes are done better than in the manga and the story of one piece is still interesting. just don't expect something top quality

    Here is my review of One Piece. One Piece are maybe the best shounen series available at the moment since  it has almost everything, so it’s a must watch anime.  
 
Story 
One Piece is about a pirate named Monkey D Luffy he is going to the Pirate king and find One Piece the greatest treasure of them all. On his way Luffy are going to gather some pirates some of them are: Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji, But the way to the Grand line is though they must fight against the marine, some mermaids,  Shichibukai also known as the seven warlords.  
 
Art 
Since the anime started in 98 the animation was kind of bad, but I got used to it, and the animation get’s a lot better over the years. It’s now released in 720p.  
 
Sound 
I like the voice cast all the main characters has some cool and kawaii voices, if you don’t liked them you will get used to it and like them prolly.  Please don’t watch the dubbed version since it sucks.  
 
I simply love the BGM in this anime it’s good. The openings are okey, nothing special the same with the endings.  
 
Character 
All the characters in One Piece are loveable since they have a unique personality that you will like and cherish.  You will get to know every character well since it will tell you about their past while you watch the series.  
 
Enjoyment 
In the start there is a lot of information about the Grand Line and the treasure One Piece. In episode 30 or something like that the anime is amazing and after that you can’t stop watch it since it so good I liked it very much.  
Overall 
One Piece is maybe the most popular anime in the whole world expect of Pokèmon though, so One Piece is fairly good anime. I guess many users here on MAL started to watch One Piece so I will say One Piece is a good starting anime for all new people  who have not seen much anime.   
If you liked my review or not PM me!

    Ok everything about this anime it's outstanding, in my opinion One Piece is the Best shounen anime Ever. 
Now let us start: 
 
STORY: It's story is Adorable a masterpiece that was named One Piece, the real deal and the good part is not only about that pirate king that hid one treasure, but it is those countless men that went out to search for it! Thrilling and exiting a story that had many anime-watchers riveted.  
 
ART: The art is Awesome the animation was fixed a little after some 200 eps(or so) every detail every part that is important for the viewer to understand the situation is being drew excelently 
 
CHARACTER: I think that the characters are one of the most outstanding things in One Piece. For starters the main character the one that wants to become king of the pirate is UNIQUE, moreover other characters are so weird and peculiar and by using them the anime is far more intersting and fun. 
 
ENJOYMENT: Not much about the enjoyment i just have to say that when an episode finishes i was like: ""i want more One Piece!!"" 
 
Now to conclude every thing about this anime is so well organized, the anime is perfect in sooo many genres it has Great action- Hillarious situations- Sad situations- Many teachings- Tremendous adventures 
 
Watch it... You MUST watch it.

    Well after watching 500+ episodes and reading the manga I think this is a good stopping point for me to review the masterpiece of an anime-series which is One Piece. 
 
At this point it’s kind of cliché to even review this anime due to the massive number of reviews written so far but in reality I feel that one piece STILL does not get the standing ovation it deserves. 
 
And maybe the ridiculous and continued FAILED Americanisation attempts of it is to blame……well anywayz it still beats ALL anime-series to date. 
 
Animation  
 
In its early days it was drawn in a lets say a “misleading” comical sense that can present the series as slapstick, well the animation complements the idea of a simple comedy - which is so far from the whole picture. 
 
Intense battle scenes can make you think your watching the most serious and brutal of anime, combined with very distinctive facial expressions of laughter, anger, disgust, misery and every other colour of the rainbow - its actually refreshing to see this basic style of animation depict such a range of emotions.  
 
Over the years you can see more detail has been put into the simple animation design without any artistic compromise…a fantastic and unique feat in my humble opinion. 
 
*A Special shout out goes to all the Fan-subbing groups for adding fantastic graphical text for character special moves (Kaizoku fansubs, Vegapunk etc)* 
 
Sound  
 
Well..well 
Firstly…let’s start by just saying the original Japanese audio is flawless in every way Openings, Closings, Background & all voice actors PERFECT. 
 
Secondly & Sadly 
4Kids entertainment have forever stained and ruined the one piece experience for countless westerners who sadly watched the horrific English dub and got a totally unreal one piece experience and although Funimation entertainment has taken over and re-dubbed it, its not only too late but still not up to scratch again. This just proves the fact that some anime just cannot be applied correctly to other regions without losing the spirit of the anime! 
 
Sorry for the mini-rant but the true one piece fans are just fed up! 
 
Japanese audio is perfect and English dub should be avoided like the swine flu! 
 
Story  
 
Again at first glance One Piece can appear to look like a slapstick pirate comedy but it’s so much more. Every character has a story in one piece and there are probably 100+ stories that could be told but the anime focuses on the ever growing Straw Hat Crew and each character of the crew. These stories usually involve a traumatizing childhood, a pivotal character related death and a goal for that character to achieve (told beautifully I might add). 
 
These stories are just brilliant and I must say out of all the long running anime series I’ve seen Dragonball, Pokemon, stupid Naruto and Bleach etc - One Piece just feels like there’s hardly any filler as all the episodes just seem to contribute to the straw hat pirates adventure!  
 
With exception to the historical special arcs found more recently which are mildly comical but not like 130 eps (STUPID-ASS NARUTO!!!) ahem. 
 
 
Characters  
 
As I said before One Piece has a HUGE number of characters From Crewmates, Marines, Civilians and SUPERVILLANS. Yep One thing One Piece does well is VILLANS these villans are the definition of pirates where killing attacking manipulating and even beating women & children is all fair play. 
 
The characters in one piece just tend to bring out the emotions in its audience Luffy will have you laughing and rooting for victory, Nami will have you wondering do all women love money this much and Zoro will have you saying should’nt this sword guy be in samurai champloo? Lol. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
One piece is easily the anime I have had the most pleasure enjoying in my anime career and I tend to use it as a pick me up emotionally, as most fans will tell you one piece has a very therapeutic quality to it..yep that’s a weird thing to say but if you agree with me chances are you hit the helpful button below this review. 
 
If I had anything bad to say about One Piece it is around the 300 Ep point I started to feel that the storyline would go in a repetitive routine that was starting to become a little bit too predictable – and just after I started feeling that way around the 400’s the entire series changes gears and shakes things up big time……so much for predictability! 
 
Value  
 
In my opinion one piece has something for everyone Action, Adventure, Comedy and trust me even though people don’t mention it this anime can actually bring ya to tears of sadness and most definitely tears of joy. 
 
Sadly I’ve noticed the sheer number of episodes steer many newcomers away thinking its too much of a commitment. 
 
This is one of the few anime I say makes me proud to be an anime fan its just One in a Million which NEVER fails to entertain! i would just warn people to not be fooled by its slapstick appearance and STAY AWAY FROM ANY AND ALL ENGLISH DUBBED VERSIONS OF ONE PIECE IT’S THE EQUVIALENT TO WATCHING POKEMON…actually that’s insulting Pokemon…sorry Ash!

    Now before fanboys get mad at me I'm just goint to say I love One Piece very much, it's one of my favorite manga of all time. It's thorough, colorful and exciting. But I have a LOT of problems with the anime.  
 
Story: The story is good, it's serviceable. Luffy goes out on an adventure to become king of the pirates. A very generic concept but once he assembles his crew (Zoro, Sanji, Chopper, Nami and Usopp specifically) things get a lot more exciting. The villains (ESPECIALLY CROCODILE) stand out a lot because of how different they are from each other. There's a lot of good guys in the marines and there's a lot of good pirates on the sea so it creates this gray area which is extremely interesting. Now for my problem with the anime, the pacing is absolute DOGSHIT and I really don't think there's an excuse for it at this point. Look at Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, it is another really long manga but it's gotten through 3 LONG story arcs without going over 100 episodes. One Piece takes its sweet time going through things and it really hurts the experience. I'm only on episode 45 of the anime because I can't handle sitting down and watching the 700 something episodes while I'm caught up with the manga 
 
Art: The style faithfully adapts Oda's work its based off of. Although at times it looks pretty awful and uncanny valley (ESPECIALLY NAMI'S FACE JESUS CHRIST SHE LOOKS SCARY AT TIMES.) I understand looking ugly some frames, it comes with animation but lord it's really bad sometimes. Like I said, the anime's style faithfully represents Oda's original work BUT it's still pretty ugly at times and I'm not talking about the random frames, I'm talking about just looking at the anime. Oda's artwork didn't translate super well into anime form.  
 
Sound: The voice actors in both the japanese version but everybody knows how shit the 4kids dub is at this point. I don't even have to talk about it. Just listen to the pirate rap and you'll understand. The voice actors in that version are so shit they take away the emotional power of some very sad scenes its that bad.  
 
Character: This is the part where the anime succeeds with flying colors (mainly because it's pretty difficult to fuck up characters from the source material but you get me.) The strawhat gang especially are well done compared to the big 3's main character and their ""crews."" The strawhats all have aspirations outside of Luffy's big dream, they all feel individual instead of desperately clinging to the mc's goal. My personal favorite strawhat is Zoro, he's been there since day 1 and he's extremely loyal. Unlike other anime characters, he doesn't forget his dream when he goes with Luffy and he continues to train. The villains are also pretty amazing, Crocodile is a cruel and sadistic pirate who watched four people who wanted to fight him die slowly while he laughed, Akainu is a bastard (One piece fans will understand why he is, spoilers) and Blackbeard is cowardly scum you DESPERATELY want to watch lose  
 
Enjoyment: IT'S ONE PIECE! If you're a fan of the manga you're gonna enjoy the anime, it's a faithful adaptation that doesn't leave anything out as far as I've seen. It's great seeing some of my favorite pirates in motion even though the animation leaves a little bit to be desired. I really highly recommend this if you're too lazy to read the manga and you still want to experience One Piece. It's shonen action at it's finest. I hope you enjoy the story as much as I am.

    The best way to describe One Piece is that it is a snowball rolling down a hill, gradually building up becoming bigger and bigger. This is probably the best way to explain the story and its development within One Piece, a lot of people struggle to get through the early episodes and I can see why but due to its snowball effect even 30 episodes later a vast majority of people are hooked. 
 
Story: 10 
 
One Pieces story follows the idea of each character having a goal they all wish to complete, but the story does not focus on this idea instead it is the adventure of achieving this goal that it follows. These adventures can be short or long, often short at the start and gradually building up as more and more depth is added to the show and around characters.  
 
When the story kicks off, shit really does hit the fan and the author of One Piece is always surprising me. There have been times I have cried, times I have laughed and times were I have wanted to knock the shit out of one of the bad guys (And it is extremely satisfying when they get the shit beaten out of them, trust me!) 
 
Art: 10(?) 
 
In regards to art style I think its very very difficult to rate an anime for its art, it may sound cliché but... Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  
 
One Piece is 10 years old and the art takes a directional change at about episode 200+ but this is in more regards to quality and colour rather then style, I myself absolutely adore One Piece and its art because of the sheer amount of colour and I never feel as though there is a couple of frames missing at any point during high action scenes. (I often find modern shows like Madoka Magicka to be lacking in colour, but that is entirely my personal preference and I can see why people like that art) 
 
Sound: 10 
 
Its impossible not to fall in love with the soundtrack of One Piece, whoever comes up with the soundtrack and what moment with what song is an absolute genius. The tracks always fit the mood, and when the infamous track 'Overtaken' comes on you know shit is about to go down. 
 
As for the sound effects themselves I can't say I have ever noticed really, I am always immersed into the show and I could not imagine they'd be any different. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The idea of the large crew of main characters put me off a little when I first heard about One Piece, character development is an important aspect for me to really get a feel for the character and be on their side - This is solved by how the show is set out the way it is, full story arks which can last a lot of episodes to introduce a character and then bringing in their back story. The characters themselves are all extremely unique, each with their own 'flavor' of personality and with their own goal but all treat each-other as equals and friends, essentially there is no side character on the crew each is of utmost importance with their own personal in-depth story. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
I'll warn any college students who have exams around the corner, One Piece is the type of show that you'll say to yourself one more episode.. then that episode ends and you are hit by a big 'To Be Continued' sign and you tell yourself, ok, just one more episode.  
 
I have laughed, cried and been pumped up with excitement watching One Piece - It is truly one of those shows which I never want to end but at the same time want to see how it ends. The day One Piece ends will be a very sad day indeed! 
 
Overall/TLDR: 10 
 
One Piece is absolutely fantastic in very aspect for me, I try to recommend it to anyone/anything I can even if they do not watch anime because it is truly a masterpiece and the only thing I have ever felt inclined to re-watch so many times. 
 
A friend who often watches anime couldn't believe it was over 500 episodes long, as he often watches anime that are one or two seasons in length (13 to 24 episodes) and asked me how I have the patience to watch them all. It was really surprising to me that he thought like this because to me 500 episodes is not enough, because each episode will have you hanging on the edge asking yourself whats next on the adventure.

    I despised One Piece years ago, I would flick through channels to see what was on, and see an absolutely unappealing show, that upon the sight & sound I cringe in hate. This would carry with me in my mindset when I started to get into anime, and see as one of the most popular shows being that trash called One Piece (of shit). I didn't think twice about ever watching it, until a little word from a friend saying to watch it & it was apparently good, but I lashed back saying it was terrible. A guy who can stretch, REALLY??? Please.  
 
It was until that I had heard that there was a another English dub, and it peaked my interest, as well as seeing screenshots comparing the 4kids version to this new Funimation version, and I saw a bloody, more mature version to the childish crap I saw when I was younger. I was intrigued & intent to view this new take on the show, and after my brother receiving about 8 DVDs of the Funimation version of One Piece, we started on what would I now call my favourite anime so far. 
 
The story revolves around the golden age of pirates, which begins after the execution of the legendary pirate named Gold D. Roger (aka Gold Roger), who after conquering the Grand Line - and the only person to do so, is named the King of the Pirates. Moments before his execution, he exclaims that the legendary treasure he attained from his adventure - The One Piece, is out in the Grand Line for anyone to claim, and to venture out and search for it themselves. This sparks the dawn of the golden age of pirates, with thousands of men setting sail to attain the legendary treasure. 
 
22 years later a young man named Monkey D. Luffy mysteriously appears with the goal of becoming the King of the Pirates. Having eaten a devil fruit - a mysterious fruit that causes anyone who eats it to gain a strange & powerful ability, while sacrificing their ability to swim. Luffy is a rubber man, and makes a name for himself in every town he ventures through. Living through this dream he travels town after town, gathering crew members and spurring notoriety.  
 
This is truly the definition of an adventure, the scale of the world & the journey they go through, the heartships, the pain, the strength they attain, the character growth, the size of the journey in general, its huge, and with it planning to go on for another 10 years, Im happy to know that there is gunna be plenty of One Piece to go :) Some people see the length of the series being so far 600+ episodes long, and be absolutely daunted and hesitant to watch it. The thing they dont see is that if they watch it, and if they love it, that there is so much there for them to watch & enjoy.  
 
This is really a case of the saying that looks can be deceiving. A wacky art style, a boy pirate made of rubber, 600+ episodes long and not ending for another 10 years! But for those who have seen as much as I have (600+ episodes) you can understand why I am so hyped about this anime, and for those who haven't, I hope this can get you to have a little idea and perhaps see it for yourselves and join Luffy & the straw hat pirates on this amazing adventure :) 
 
Speaking of the straw hat, it was given to Luffy by a pirate called Shanks, and the thing with Shanks is, along with many of the other characters in this series is that they are so incredibly badass & awesome XD You meet these characters at the very start, and just wait in anticipation to seeing them again after the crazy stuff Luffy & his crew endure, only to see them even more incredibly badass than before, and its such an incredible feeling & experience. 
 
The character growth in this is magnificent too, the straw hat even has a deep backstory!! :P Every time you meet another crew member, you see their past, which most of the time is an absolute tear jerker, and gets you attached to that character, and before you know it, your attached to everyone in the crew, and they grow on you. They go through unbelievably absurd obstacles & struggles, face the most powerful foes there is, face death, and manage to prevail if it means defeating the foe, or losing and building up their strength. You are essentially a part of Luffy's crew, and when they go through heartache, you break down along with them, when they prevail, its the best feeling ever.  
 
When One Piece eventually hooks you in, and eventually convinces you to becomes one of the crew members, your in for one hell of a journey. And It isn't going to end anytime soon, so you'll have plenty of crazy places to run into, awesome characters to face, and the absolutely ridiculous Luffy causes chaos wherever he may be :P And eventually wait for the day where he will, in fact, become the King of the Pirates. And what a wonderful day that will be :D

    Hello All.  Firstly let me say. This review is about the facts of the show.   I will try to leave my personal opinon out of it until the end, because for one it's my favorite anime.   What I hope this review does is give you some insight about the anime and what to expect. 
 
==Story == 
 
Yes im sure youv'e heard of it.  Monkey D. Luffy, an ordinary boy who ate a fruit of the ocean (devils fruit) turned into a rubber man.  After being saved by his role model who is a pirate, he goes off to be the King of the Pirates.   
 
==Anime Episodes== 
 
Firstly, there are three versions of this anime.  The first being the Original Japanese version which I highly recommend.    The second being the Funimation english dub version, which is the exact translation of the Japanese version.    And lastly.. the dreaded 4kids version which should not be watched and burned on sight.   (Sorry for that opinon but I think all one piece fans will agree) 
 
==500+ Episodes OMG== 
 
Yes the anime is over 500 episodes long.  But don't let the number scare you away.   One piece tells a story with every single arc.  Oda (the Creator) made the show in a way where you get the see what is going through the minds of every main character and enemy before the fight/struggle/adventure takes place.   I warn you now.  If you are looking for just pure action, READ THE MANGA.   The anime stays true to the fights but, its an anime.  They can't just catch up on the  manga.  So what do they do? They extend the fights, and the events before the fights.   I think its great, but for some, it may seem as though the anime is dragging on. 
 
==Artwork== 
 
Nowadays anime's are coming out in 1080p.  One piece is older, so naturally the orignal episodes look older.  But rest assured, by the time you get to Enes lobby arc, there will be a huge animation quality upgrade.  Not opinion, fact.  
 
==Character Development == 
 
Each character develops because they all have thier own personal goals and dreams as they travel with Luffy (or try to capture him).   They all mature in thier own way.   And when I say everybody I mean EVERYBODY.   Again.. 500+ episodes.    
 
== Opinion == 
 
Watch it.  Don't expect it to kick off into a action packed pew pew shoot em up fight until many episodes in.   But what got me hooked was seeing his crew get through struggles, fight for their goals and life, seeing them face enemies that are sometimes stronger than thier entire crew put together, or more cunning than them.   Seeing how a person who's only abilitly is stretching with some inhuman strength fight enemies made of elements such as smoke for example.   Seeing the tears of thier crewmembers as they fight for thier friends.   Truly, I found this anime to be moving, funny, and have some insanely INTENSE fights.    This is also the first anime where I was rooting for some of the bad guys as well as good guys.  I love luffy's crew, but some baddies are just... damn cool (Icy Cool in fact.) 
 
==Closing== 
If your looking for an anime thats short, to the point, great kickoff, than this is not the anime for you.  It's long, but enjoyably so. 
If DO however have time, patience, and in the mood for a good story with in my opinion GREAT rewards for sticking with it, than this is the anime for you.    
 
 I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

    I have been watching this anime and reading manga for over a year. It has only gotten better. Although I enjoy the anime, I recommend folks to read the manga, which is the original work of the writer, and please dont watch the dubbed English version of this animation, they have done a crappy job and the emotions, the feel, its all wrong in dubbed version. 
 
Best story, with careful and in depth development of all characters, funny as hell, good action and great quality of art, one of my favorite animes of all times, and anime writer is going for 1k episodes, so be patient, and stay addicted like I am :)

    I think that you wanted for a long time to watch One Piece, but you put it off because of its number of episodes, then you should go and read the manga. You will catch up a lot faster and you will experience the One Piece story at its fullest. But if you are not a manga fan and you only watch anime, I recommend you to watch the special Episode of East Blue, which is a summary for the first saga, with great art and animation. If you enjoy it, then go and start the actual anime from episode 1 so you do not miss anything of this story, that makes One Piece such a beautiful series. 
 
I will be short: the enjoyment and the overall score are both 10/10. The story, the art, the sound, the characters, everything is a 10 out of 10 for me. But the anime has pacing issues. The pacing is so slow sometimes that is infuriating. That is why I think is better to binge One Piece when you watch it. Or read the manga.  
The voice acting is on point. The art and the animation can be weird sometimes, but overall I enjoyed the visuals. 
I was introduced to this series via the anime, I caught up with 750 episodes, which was the number of episodes that were out 3 years ago, in just 3 months. Then, I went and read the manga from chapter 1. I have watched all the movies and special episodes. 
 
I will not go into detail about the story and the characters in this review. If you want, you can check my manga review. 
Overall, this is a good adaptation, but not quite on the level of the greatness that is the manga.

    So, it's a shounen, a goofy and silly shounen indeed, but I think what it fills even better is being a prime example of what not to be.  
 
So the art. It's probably worse than any American cartoon I've ever seen. I mean, my little brother could draw better than that. Honestly it's more hysterical than anything because of how appallingly bad it is. 
 
Episode 1 started off with your eyes and ears bleeding, from both the terrible art to the terrible sound (and yes, I mean the screaming). That kid was screaming so loud I though his voice would break. But unfortunately, this did not happen. 
 
I have given this anime a total of 3 chances so far. Every time it has undoubtably let me down. It has now become a running joke amongst my friends, I guess it has that going for it.

    This is a anime that will suprise you all the way....not just a few times like some other animes but siriously all the way ^^ why? i could say its awesome but i doubt you (reader) will be thinking ""wow then it must be as good as he says"" rofl so here we go.... 
 
i will number this maybe its easyer.....the top 10 best things about this anime with 10 as not so great and 1 great 
 
10. The art style, yes a big issue for allot of people who considerd this anime and didnt watch it because of the art style....but if you remember it well this is a review about the 10 GOOD things so that means the art style isnt a bad thing. actually its refreshing and suprisingly good. It shouldnt be anything difrent , if it would have it would be one piece as we know it....maybe its difficult to get into it because it isnt high end drawings but still it makes it unique and thats why its still good when its bad.  
 
9. Pirates....it isnt my fav subject around on this world actually beside pirates of the carab i never liked things about pirates....whats with the old ships, the crappy heads and the drinking all the time anyway? but this made the pirate genre so difrent so new that after watching this serie you will love them....maybe because its not really traditional pirates....its more like a comination between fantasy and the good old pirate work....and still you will see allot of big characters in the pirate world that you will remember of from stories like disney. 
 
8. the world....yes this is something that comes right after the subject pirates....because its unique in its own way and still something that shouldnt have been used to begin with...a whole world made out of water and island.....you would think it would be boring because even after a few of episodes from pokemon when they where traveling around islands it got boring....but this wont.....you will notice sometimes they stick around on an island for tons of eps and still you wont be bored....the world has allot of favriations but but still not that much that you will get lost....great design of the world ^^  
 
7. villain....yes, they are awesome, they are scary....but not too scary, they are funny but not that much that you wont take them sirious anymore and even if you take them sirious and you are scared of them they still will make you laugh at some point.....sometimes they are all fun sometimes they are all sirous but most of the time they are an combination of both and they have awesome attacks, unique abilities and last but not least some weird way of always returning and never actually die.....its up too you if thats a good or bad thing. 
 
6. npc's....yes i shouldnt call them no playable caracters but you feel for the crew of the luffys ship but you never actually feel compasion about the people surounding them....only a few times but that s because they are longer in the storie then a few eps....anyway, the people who help the strawhead crew are great they give that little bit of extra to make the story going on even when it gots boring..... 
 
5. the ship.....i wont go on about this for too much but at some point you will even care about the ship where our heroes sail on.... 
 
4. the music....yes its a big deal, maybe not from the start but the anime has about over 400 episodes now and still allot of the sounds are still being used from episode 1.....this makes it special because after about 100 eps you will remember them you will sing them in your head and you will c rave for the ost to have....even the opening and ending songs are great, various, and original.... 
 
3. humor....yes, comedy is a big deal in this anime....even at times you dont expect it its there and you want it to be there....be affraid, because your tummy will hurt when you watch a few eps in a row ^^  
 
2. the crew....the strawhead crew is one of those things that makes this show go how it goes.....they have allot of histroy and backgrounds, they are unique and original designd and they have their own flaws but also their own powers....they are difrent then all the other caracters in this anime and thats why its a good choice they are almost in every episode ^^  
 
1. the story.....yes this is I think the best thing about this anime.....the story, not only will you not expect an anime drawn this simple have a very deep story at some points, also you wont expect to actually tear and cry because of it....you want to watch all those 400+ eps because you WANT to know how it goes further.....you will be on a story rush 24/7....even the fillers are great, funny and deep enough to watch them....and to be honest i think if a story is great about an anime its already worth watching even all the other things dont work for you.... 
 
 
Thats why i recomend dont hold back because of the art style or the weird sence of humor sometimes and keep watching .....after 30/50 eps you will be hooked and smack yourself on the head blaiming yourself you didnt watch it to begin with ^^

    One Piece for me is probably the greatest piece of work I've ever seen come from an anime creator.  The incredible thing has nothing to do with the art or the special effects, but rather the powerful emotion drawn from within many of the scenes incited by the characters.  The emotional scenes draw out the full potential and strength of the main characters which makes them look really (how should i say it ""nutz"" or ""kickass"").  If that isn't enough, its flawless storyline brings out something more and more and as the story goes on and on and every little event comes into detail which all connects together for the preparation of an incredible event yet to come.  One Piece never fails to make me laugh, cry, and do both at the same time in this amazing piece of work.

    One Piece is The Greatest Shonen Anime/Manga of all time. 
 
It features a grand adventure full of colourful and developed characters, each with their own unique goals and dreams. The narrative is extremely well-paced and intriguing with great writing and presentation; the Animation and Music are both incredibly top-notch. They give each Arc/Location it's own style of atmosphere which makes the series very innovative. This coincides with the genius storytelling that balances badass action scenes and hilarious comedic moments. One Piece is also a very memorable show with gorgeous imagery and designs. An example of this brilliance is in the backstory for the Punk Hazard Arc where a character with a Fire-type ability battles an Ice-type character for a long time in one location, an island. This results in a contrast of settings and characters because half the island is covered in Ice while the other half is engulfed by Fire, so different variations and ideas are explored in just one Arc! 
 
Finally, the series just knows how to have fun and not be overly-dramatic like many other Animes. This in turn, makes the few brilliant dramatic episodes all the more impactful!  
 
One Piece is a True Classic.

    I'm writing this review because the people who think they know what this anime is about after watching 30 episodes annoy me. Some even criticise one piece because it's tOo LoNg. Let me say, first of all, that you can't become the king of the pirates in 60 episodes. 
 
If you're looking for the typical main character, selfless, strong, who does everything right, then DON'T watch one piece. Luffy makes a lot of wrong moves. A LOT. That's what this anime is really about. A dummy and careless captain who needs his friends (and a bunch of other very interesting people) to fulfil his dream. Yes, he's saved a lot of people during his adventure, but he's put even more people in danger when he was in trouble. He loses fights. He annoys his friends. He wants everything to go his way. He is very familiar with the words ""mistake"" and ""defeat"". That's what makes him special. You'll see his and his nakamas' (buddies) character developments in one piece.  
 
Is it slow? Only if you want it to be. If you can't appreciate every detail, such as characters' (usually) sad pasts, you'll find yourself bored sometimes. The sense of time is pretty realistic in the one piece world. The crew needs to train? Forget the one-episode-long evolution, and get ready to see real changes (that obviously take some time).  
 
I've enjoyed every single episode, loved each and every character, and valued all the little details in the series. Every fan understands why one piece is so long, that's why many get mad when someone says it shouldn't have so many episodes. I believe that one piece is worth 800 episodes, and many many more <3

    One Piece is a great example of that saying ""Too much of everything is bad"". 
 
Story: 6/10 
Had I only watched half of the series, then I would've given it a 10/10 score. Because One Piece is actually good, really good! - at least up until Marineford Arc - after that, the story became overly dramatic. It's as  if the author himself wasn't able to move on from the reactions that Marineford arc has received - thus he started using it a lot of times to give Luffy and Ace' fans some emotional scenes - it was effective at first, but he did it too much to the point that it has lost it's effect. 
 
Overly huge size boobs - Most female characters suddenly have those overly huge boobs (especially Nami and Robin) it was used too much for fan service so the attention for the characters were often divided between their bouncing boobs and what they were doing. 
 
Another thing that I didn't like is the way that SH crew members were separated. What I really love in One Piece, is the relationship between SH crew members - that strong friendship that they built during their journey - that family like  bond that they have. They cry and laugh together, face different problems together and solve them all together - I really miss that part of this series. 
 
 
Art: 6/10 
One Piece had that unique animation and art style but after that time skip, it changed drastically. The characters are no longer as good looking as before. 
 
Sound: 5/10 
The opening and ending songs weren't really my type so I often skipped them after listening to it once. Although the sound effects and musical scores that they use during emotional and intense fights scenes are really good. 
 
Character: 9/10 
The main characters are still the same. They grew up and changed a lot, compared to how they were when they were introduced the first time - although they are still as hilarious as ever. 
There are some new characters that were introduced...they were interesting at first but they didn't left a strong impression on me...they are not the type that I will miss once they are gone. 
 
Overall: 6/10

    I don't know how to start writing this review because I don't know how to type what emotions I go through while watching this anime (and often days after). But the biggest feeling I get is awe. Awe with jaw drops and goosebumps. One top of that there's hilarious comedy, some tearful moments and conveyed anger. That is a part of what makes up my favourite anime of all time, One Piece. 
 
Even though I would think most know the basics of One Piece, I'll go through it again. 
There once lived a man named Gol D. Roger who was given the title The Pirate King. At his moment of execution, he announced that his greatest treasure, One Piece, is hidden away in 'that place' and invited anyone to find it. This brought The Great Age of the Pirates and many men set out to the sea to find One Piece and become Pirate King. 
The story follows Luffy, probably the most lovable hero you'll ever come across. He aims to become Pirate King and sets out on a journey through the seas to wholeheartedly follow his goal. He first plans to gather his crew members and a ship to then journey through the greatest and toughest seas, The Grand Line. 
 
Story 10/10 - The story One Piece follows is very unique, not just in comparison to other animes but also Hollywood. You might say, 'Pirates, big whoop, it's been done before' but I have no words to express how wrong you'd be. I wasn't a fan of the pirate genre (unless it had Johnny Depp in it) but One Piece opened my eyes.  
The plot is solid and I have to say that Oda knows how to tie everything together perfectly. There's nothing that doesn't happen for a reason in this anime. There aren't many useless fillers or completely pointless arcs. As the story moves further, you'll find yourself getting more and more attached.  
 
Sound 10/10 - The sound is brilliant. The music gets you leaning forward in your seat, eyes wide, grips hardened (hmm, sounds too much like a H-anime but you get what I mean). Without the music to braze together everything, I doubt One Piece would be worth half its value. The moods are set perfectly and I yet have to pick out a moment where a sound theme has even been a second too late or early. I get so hyped up when hearing certain music themes. Every character also has their own theme song which is just done perfectly to suit the character. Another thing that suits the characters is the laugh each character is given with their persona, each unique. 
 
Art 10/10 - I do admit I was one of those people who put off One Piece for a long time because I didn't like the art. I don't know if my vision was lacking because now that I can finally see, it is truly spectacular art. I thought the character design seemed half done but it couldn't suit each person more. The background art has always been beyond standards with certains scenes where you just want to pause and stare at.  
After the time skip, the art becomes more modern (by that I mean crisp). The characters have a new added gloss but they still have the style unique to One Piece.  
The main thing which I love about the animation is that there are regular costume changes for the characters. So you never sit through it and wonder if they actually are stinky pirates with scurvy. 
 
Characters 10/10 - Probably the strongest point of One Piece, as it should be for any anime (unfortunately this is too much to ask for in most cases). Luffy is an unwavering character who will always do what he thinks is right. He is childish and a bit spoilt but this makes him the person who everyone is drawn to. He doesn't chase any unnecessary romances, his mind is set to his one goal to become Pirate King. I have never heard (and doubt I ever will hear) anyone mention anything along the lines of 'I dislike Luffy'. The other main characters are also just as worthy. 
Zoro's determination makes him one of my favourite characters, also because he's just boss with his santoryu. 
Nami is a theif whose main interest is money and navigating but isn't that a true pirate? Her cunning ways make her the awesome character she is. 
Usopp is well Usopp. He's a liar and a coward just as his name states but he brings about the greatest character development because I have to say that I absolutely hated him at the start. 
Sanji is just kickass (it's a pun because he kicks to fight). His overly love towards women does become occasionally annoying but he is an amusing and strong character.  
Chopper, is a cotton candy loving reindeer often mistakened as a tanuki (racoon). He is a cute, lovable, funny character who can become something else when pushed. 
Robin is a smart character whose wit always has you thinking how cool she is.  
Franky is a suuppeerr character. He's strong and really funny. 
Brook is a very unique person. He's a hentai whose jokes always make you crack up laughing.  
 
All of these characters come with unique back stories and a purpose which I just love.  
The supporting characters of One Piece have been given so much of thought. Many characters grow to become your favourites. Characters such as Ace, Whitebeard, Mihawk, Shanks, Hancock, even though they don't play the main role, it feels as though a lot of thought has been poured into them. 
There have also been characters who were purposely created to hate, like the tenryuubito.  
 
All in all, the character section makes up the main traits of One Piece. 
 
Overall 10/10, I don't think I can give this any other score. It is an anime for all ages and I promise you that you will never regret watching it. One Piece isn't just something for entertainmemt, it's become a part of my life.

    Story: 7 
 
Art: 8 
 
Sound: 5 
 
One piece gets so much praise, I wanted to know why so I decided to watch the anime, 90 episodes in, and I'm so disappointed. Music has little to no impact on the show. 
 
Art is pretty good from a show that started 16 years ago. 
 
When Luffy beats the main baddies, it just doesn't feel satisfying, his finishers and knockouts are so underwhelming. Luffy doesn't go through any real struggle or hardships to win, he just ""simply"" had the power all along to beat anyone. He's the most OP anime main character starting from episode 1 that I've ever seen. He'll take a few punches, but he'll save the day regardless and his crew members rely on him to do so.  
 
It's the same drill over and over, Luffy comes up with new moves with no backstory as to how he does so, he simply comes up with them on the fly like gomu gomu gatling, he's on par with a world class fighter.  
 
If I had to choose what show to recommend to other people, I'd choose Naruto instead. I'm listening to Man of the World from Naruto right now, and the journey, pain and sadness all the characters went through, makes me so appreciative of effective music.. 
 
I started with the anime of One Piece, so that I could remember Luffy's journey with it's music and get the full experience with VA's, sound effects, and OPs/EDs but it's been a unmemorable disaster. Naruto is simply better and more memorable in all aspects besides Art.  
 
One piece anime just doesn't compare.

    One piece, one of the best shounen Manga out there. If you want a good shounen story, with a deep lore and good character, you will need to read the One piece manga. But, why READ? because the anime is an utter failure! Yeah there's some good scene but that will never justify how bad the rest of animation is. There's an episode where the recapping is 10 minutes long, and then nothing happen! Some of the animation even just is a still image with bad background voice acting. Maybe this is justified with so many episode out there and how they try to matching-up with the manga, but then, it just better to stop the show air then get back later with an actual good quality show.  
 
Story : 10/10 (read the manga) 
art : 1/10 (oh please the animation make my eyes bleed) 
Sound : 7.5/10 (redeemable, its good) 
Character : 8/10 (it's same as the manga so it's good) 
Enjoyment : 2/10 (The bad quality animation is greatly destroying the  
                          enjoyment) 
Overall : 3 (ban Toei please)

    *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS* 
 
Right now the show is 694 episodes in and, looking back, I have no idea how I caught up to all of it. 
Honestly I think most of the reviews of what's wrong with this show are pretty accurate.  I love it to death but damn it has some major flaws.  A few good things though.  I personally like the art but I know a lot of people don't.  The world is imaginative and very creative especially when it comes to Devil Fruits and the creative ways people have been able to use their abilities.  Read the other reviews if you want a complete run through of the show but I'm gonna name a few things that personally bugged me/ pissed me off. 
 
Things that bug me: 
1. This anime has become DREADFULLY SLOW.  Nothing gets accomplished in the episodes because its mostly based on the opening and recaps of past episodes.  For example, right now Zoro is STILL fighting Pica.  WHY?!!! Pica was no match for Zoro from the get so why are they still fighting?  That fight could've been wrapped up in one episode but its been going on for like 5-6 episodes now.  I feel like sometimes I can skip certain episodes because nothing is happening. 
 
2. The wacky ass looking villains.  Every single villain thus far besides the marine officials look like complete and utter retards.  I'm not saying they don't have cool powers but by god they just look ridiculous. 
 
3.  No one dies in this anime.  Well, correction, people only die in flashback.  Ace and Whitebeard died but that was just to further the plot.  Whenever a character has a backstory you can always assume that someone close to them is going to die.  Other than that, everyone seems to be fucking immortal.  You remember that bird guy in the Alabasta Arc who took an atomic bomb to the fucking face? HE WALKED THAT SHIT OFF IN A COUPLE DAYS!!  How about that old man in the skypiea arc who got hit with Eneru/Enel's huge ass lightning beam AND SURVIVED?!!!!  But the biggest anomaly has to be Zoro and the amount of blood this guy has lost.  I don't care if you want to say ""his determination drives him to live"" or ""this is an anime so things get exaggerated"" this guy loses 99.9% of his blood all the time but always recovers in a few days.   
 
4.  Too many characters.  You remember when it was only Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Nami, and Sanji on the ship?  Everyone got equal attention and we fully understood what each character was thinking and feeling.  Now its a complete wreck.  There are so many  characters on the team and off that no one has time for any character development.  All the straw hats are pushed aside and are mainly only around for comedy purposes that aren't really that funny.  All the side characters in each arc do most of the work in helping the crew since they are ALWAYS divided.  I'm not saying I hate these other characters since most of them are pretty badass.  I'm saying that theres just way too many. 
 
5. This isn't really a problem but its definitely one of the biggest things that bug me about this show.  So in this world there are pirates, sea monsters, sky people, fish people, and special fruits that give special powers.  Thats all perfectly fine I don't have a problem with that.  However, the way One Piece's logic supposedly goes, only people with devil fruits should be powerful and every regular person in the islands that they travel to should just be normal people.  If thats the case then how come people without devil fruits are so fucking powerful?.  Luffy ate the gum gum fruit so he can stretch, but that doesn't explain why  he's so goddamn strong enough to break a fucking ship with his foot.  I wouldn't mind this but people without devil fruits, whether they be regular pirates or citizens, are portrayed as people with normal human limitations.  Therefore, it makes no sense that Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, or anyone else could be that strong just because they ""trained for a long time"".

    One piece is a classic anime, brilliantly done with an amazing creative flare for imagination by the author. It is set in a fictional world that is divided into 4 major oceans (East, West, North, South) which meet in the centre in a place called the ""grand line"". This is supposedly a legendary place where very powerful pirates live and constantly search for the great treasure of the deceased pirate king, ""one piece"". 
 
The story follows the life of a teenager, ""Monkey D. Luffy"", who has the ability to stretch his body in any way and holds the properties of rubber. He is an extrovert character who is both stupid in personality, eats way too much food and is completely unreasonable when he wants something. His personality is almost equal to that of Goku from Dragonball, Naruto and Natsu from fairy tail. This criticism exists that one piece is another shounen anime with the same stereotypical protagonists. This is true, however, it is still the great original shounen anime and if you enjoyed any of the above you will love this one too. 
 
The anime is quite old and currently has over 650 episodes, this makes starting the anime for some people non viable due to the old graphics not being in tip top condition. YOU GET USED TO IT; and the graphics improve over time. There are tonnes of mysteries in this anime that are still being debated (which i will not spoil). 
 
Character wise there is great versatility and for some of you anime lovers there are parts where the ecchiness and comedy gets off the charts, but because Luffy is a character who doesn't understand the concept of ""mature relations"" (*cough...sex) they do not develop. 
 
If you want to watch a great anime with incredibly interesting fights and imaginative powers (called devil fruit powers in their world. E.g. control of the elements, alter your body, create earthquakes, control shadows etc...) then one piece is right for you.

    Since the last review I wrote was a little overwhelmed by my fan-boying crap, well it was the first one I ever wrote tho, and I decided to be a little more objective about writing a review about One Piece. I, myself, really adore this one, but people mostly underrate it because it has many episodes, or is a little bit old. Anyways, let's begin. 
 
Story - 8/10 - The story is focused about Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who lived in the era known as ""The Great Age of Pirates"", which was encouraged by the great Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Altho the anime is really old(began airing in 1999), the story is very well writen, by my opinion. It currently has 683 episodes and is still ongoing and like every anime that has a lot of episodes, it does have quite much fillers indeed, and they can be really annoying I admit that. It also has somekind of a unique story, and that pirate theme is really awesome in some ways. You don't see much animes that have the pirate-theme in them. As I was saying, the story is really unique. Now, that were mostly pros of One Piece, but it has a few cons aswell. Like, the plots aren't such good ones, they're mostly predictable. This wasn't a spoiler, it was just a fact. Altho i watched every single arc from the beggining till the end, some of them aren't really needed there, they're fillers put in that way. 
 
Art - 6/10 - I rate the animation of this anime on a 6. I've taken into account that this anime dates from 1999, but even now the animation isn't such high-quality. Even if it is available in 1080p HD, it isn't very admirable, so I rated it a 6. 
 
Sound - 7/10 - Aswell as the animation, the sound in some point in the anime is really bad, and at some points it's really good. If we take OST's and openings into the account for sound, I say that they add quite a bit to the total experience of One Piece. 
 
Characters - 8/10 - I think that the characters were really made up well, and that he added just what it was needed to make them compatible with eachother by making them all share the same horrific past. Some people may think it's a little bit of exaggerating, and I think so too, it isn't very realistic for them all to have traumas from their childhood, or to bear scars, but that's what he did so the characters could've bonded through the anime by experiencing ""hell and heaven"" with eachother. I approve of this in my own way. 
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 - I give it a total enjoyment of 8. It is a little bit different from a regular Shounen anime, but what made me give it a 9 is just because I enjoyed watching every second of it so, so, so much, even if it were fillers. It had a lot of emotional scenes aswell that I still like rewatching from time to time. If I was more objective about this, and if I considered other people opinions about this, I would've said it's a 6 or a 5. But I simply don't think that way, and I may have fan-boyed it a bit on the end, but hey, I really liked this anime tho. 
 
Overall - 7/10 - I'd give it a total of a 7. It's a very objective view about it, if it was myself I'd give it a 10, but honestly, it doesn't deserve it. If you look through the grades I've been giving all over, it has to be a 7 overall. If you're gonna watch this anime you should be prepared for the bad animations for about 300 first episodes, then it sharpens up a bit i think, and gets at about 720p, but it all comes down the the personal opinions of people, if you like this type of anime I don't think you'll mind the animation much. Also, I forgot to mention, it has quite a few movies(12 or 13, can't remember straight now) and a couple of specials. 
 
I think I've written a better review than my last one, and thanks if you read it to the end.

    Let me start by saying that i also though that an anime about a guy made of rubber with a hat made of straw seemed pretty dumb. 
 
One Piece is about Luffy whose ambition is to find a treasure, One Piece, and become the King of Pirates. To achieve that, he assembles several friends along his journey and has to face many strong opponents. This anime is VERY addicting and after watching a dozen of episodes you will want to watch all of them for sure. 
 
Normally, its quite a comical anime and with lots of fights. Nevertheless, it has some more serious parts that make it an outstanding anime and gives it more intensity.

    At first you think that One Piece is a typical Shonen with ridiculous fights and shitty drawing. In fact, these two never improve. But there are things that make One Piece soooooo... much better than Bleach, Naruto and even Hunter x Hunter. And these things are the story, characters, foreshadowing and the unique One Piece universe. There are also nice concepts about will inheritance, man's dreams and giving up personal goals for the sake of close friends/relatives. 
 
Ok. So here are my scores: 
 
Art: 0/10 
Music: 0/10 
Fights: 0/10 
World design: 0/10 
Characters: 10/10 
Story: 50/10 
 
So Overall: 60/60. Deal with it. 
 
The problem with One Piece is that you need to understand all these foreshadowings, concepts and not complain about PIS's (Plot Induced Stupidities) which can be quiet difficult. So there will be a problem if you are mature enough to see all the stupid and ridiculous things but not mature enough to enjoy the good things. 
 
P.S. 
Sorry for the bad english.

    Oda Eiichiro is a genius! The story of One Piece is outstanding great: 
The East Blue arc: 
The Buggy arc make you laugh into a K.O. 
In the Kuro and Don Kreig arc you understand: this is just the begining. 
The Arlong arc make you crying on Nami's past. 
In the Log Town arc you know: it's time for new, epic adventure on the Grand Line. 
 
The Barock Works arc: 
Adventures on the ""Little Garden"" crash you, you know: there will be more and more exiting adventures! 
Chopper's history make you heart full of tears, you cry and cry. 
The episodes with Arabasts make you remember the desert, you know that's isn't all! 
 
The Skypia arc blow you away in the sky and make the story much better and exiting! 
 
The Water 7 arc: 
The begining is very nice! The battle with Aokiji make you understand: Luffy isn't the strongest! The island ""Water 7"" give you so much beauty and you now know: One Piece has not problem in technologie!The intrigue with Robin, Iceberg, Franky and CP9 make the anime such exiting! 
The brave act on the tower of juctice made you more brave, you are not scary of the government. 
Robin's past made you crying even more, than Chopper's, you are taken in the drama, full of sorrow. 
The battles are so exiting!  
In the end of the arc you cfn understand: Oda IS a genius!!!! 
The Thriller Bark arc make you laugh with Luffy at the comic horror! 
The Sabaody make you cry at the last day of the Mugiwara team, but then it's going the Impel Down arc, with more funny actions and old friends, like Buggy, MR2 and MR3! 
The Marine Ford arc make so crying at the Ace's past, at Luffy, when Ace die, he has lost 2 of precious brothers! 
So overall the story is outstanding! 
 
The problem of the art is Hencok! Animators are mock the art of Oda's Hencock doing her very ugly! Overall it's great, it could be outstanding, but Hencok... 
 
The sounds are very good! The good of the sounds are Gomu-Gomu attacks! The sound where his arms are stretching in the sky  is outstanding! The openings and endings are great! So, overall 8.5 
 
Characters are amazing! Hencock, Jango, Moria, Luffy, Usopp, Buggy, Garp and others are so amazing!!!! They're really great! Outstanding! 
 
I love so much One Piece because he is so enjoyble! That's great adventure from East Blue to the end of the Grand Line, searching One Piece is outstanding! Oda made the main theme of the anime so cool! Luffy traveling many diffrent islands! It IS amazing! He is doing all islands so diffrent, and so diffrent characters! Amazing! 
So, overall it IS the best anime, so 10.999999!

    In short One piece has been beating a dead horse for about a decade now I see quite a bit of overhyped fans on here, I'm afraid it's just anywhere close to the hype anymore. Lets start with the story.  
 
Story. 1/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. Ridiculous Pirates go on Ridiculous adventures is how I would sum it up, add in a couple of cheap laughs and cheap emotional segments and you have summed one piece up.  
  
Art. 2/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. 
 
Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. 
 
Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. 
 
Enjoyment. 3/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... 
 
overall this series has been dragged on way too long, and for me personally has lost it's appeal long ago, I just had to drop it. However every now and then I will watch it on Toonami for a few cheap laughs other than that i highly recommend you stay away from this anime it just is way to over hyped and they are just beating a dead horse at this point.

    One Piece is one of the Greatest! Anime series out there in my opinion..with cool, loveable, funny and especially strong main characters, in more ways than one. 
 
Friendship is one of the most important values in this show, and this anime has always managed to make a smile on my face and at times inspired me in many ways. Which are a couple of reasons why i like this Anime. 
 
I really love this anime, and i am very grateful to Eiichiro Oda-sensei for creating this wonderfull masterpiece of his. 
 
If you haven't started watching this anime yet, i strongly reccomand it to you. 
 
(And i'm talking about the original Japanese version. I do not recommend the 4Kids English Dub version. The 4Kids English Dub version will only give a bad impression of the anime, and doesn't make much sense.)

    omg, you have to watch this!!!! but not the dub. o god pleze do not watch the dub. and if you have seen the dub, then you're probaly thinking , o, this show is probably too chldish to enjoy, but believe me, it's not! i mean, one of the great things about one piece is that it is always watchable and exciting. it has serious moments and emotional ones, but it never becomes too much of a drag. the main tone of the show, even in a fight scene, is light and humourous, with just the right amount of seriousness needed. and the characters are fabulous!

    Ok, since there are so many reviews for One Piece, so I'll try not to rehash the usual stuff. This review will more like why you should watch one piece. 
 
Story: 
If there is one word to describe One Piece's story, I'd pick ""GRAND"". 500+ episodes and it's only 1/2 to 2/3 of the way there. The story is about Luffy who wants to be the Pirate King, so he set sail to Raftel which holds the treasure called One Piece. In his journey there, he picked up nakama (comrades) and meet new people along the way. 
 
Some of the islands that they stopped by are: 
Desert kingdom 
Winter island 
Prehistoric island  
Venice style waterworld 
Sky islands 
Haunted island 
Amazon style women only island 
Fishman island deep under the sea 
 
The formula is somewhat standard, where you will discover the past of the island, and Luffy will fight the strongest enemy to help the islands. However, each island's story and characters are unique so it's a new adventure every time they set foot on an island.  
 
Mysteries: 
Besides the main plot, there are also some side mysteries that keep viewers guessing and spawned hundreds of forum posts. Luffy's father, ancient weapons, void century, what is One Piece etc. These are unraveled slowly and tastefully along the way. 
 
Characters: 
This is where One Piece shine the most. The characters are some of the most unique and wacky of all the anime/manga I've watched. You will laugh, cry, and feel for them. The main characters will grow, but their personality is consistent throughout the anime. 
Some characters who ate the Devil Fruit are given unique abilities. Like Luffy's rubber ability which allow him to stretch his body, or Ace's flame ability to allow him to turn into flame. 
 
Final words: 
If you have not watched One Piece, you might be overwhelmed by the sheer number of episodes. However, it's a blessing that you can watch One Piece non-stop while those who have caught up are waiting agonizingly for 1 episodes per week. Give One Piece a try and you might discover why One Piece is the most popular manga series in Japan.

    One Piece is the best shounen anime ever made. Hands down. No contest. Bleach, Naruto, Gintama, and all those others have nothing on One Piece.  
 
What you got is an EPIC story. 
What you have are AMAZING characters. 
What you see is COOL art and animation. 
What you experience are AWESOME levels of entertainment. 
 
You can't even say it's a competition about which is the best anime. This is it. One Piece is IT.

    This is one of my first reviews and I'm going to try to be as least biased as I possibly can. 
 
One Piece, without a doubt, is a very close contender for my favorite anime. I gave it an overall 8, and the only definite 10 I will ever give out is Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. 
 
Story: 
 
I gave One Piece an 8 in the story for many reasons. One Piece has some amazing arcs and sagas. The background, foreshadowing, and character development is amazing, and can leave you in awe. Some arcs however, are very long and drawn out, and can leave you with arc fatigue.  
 
I felt like the Skypiea arc was too long for its own good. It didn't have that rich character development you usually get from One Piece. By the end of it, I just wanted to move on to the next arc as quickly as possible.  
 
Thriller Bark was not as long as Skypiea, but it was very bland until the very end.  
 
Arcs like Arlong, Marineford, and Summit War stand out because they are the best points in the whole story. These arcs are well written and have lots of character development. These arcs have a lot of flashbacks which help create the characters. 
 
Another major point in One Piece is that the story is not always serious and edgy. The characters have their own gags and a fight that normally is serious could have some funny spins on it. The beginning of arcs and end of arcs are usually more funny, but their is always room for comedy in the middle. 
 
Art: 6 
 
One Piece has a problem that a lot of shonen anime have. The art style is very sloppy and are drawn in very different ways. The unique thing about One Piece's art style is that you rarely get the same type of body on every character. Dynamic characters are usually drawn differently from the basic characters which make them stand out. 
 
Crab walking. It happens A LOT. One Piece characters aren't always shown doing this, but it really hits a nerve when it happens. Sometimes, a character will be drawn walking with his knees bent in different directions. Some people say its just a part of his Oda's art style, but it still isn't appealing.  
 
Something that is not terrible are the way he draws the heads. Some characters have lemon heads, some have normal heads, and some characters have bowling pins for heads. It really isn't that big of a deal, but if you are REALLY picky about art style, this could be a big turn off.  
 
Sound: 10 
 
One Piece is the only anime that I've watched where i felt like the soundtrack is very fitting. It can be very light at times and also very serious. It's also unique because most of the soundtrack is orchestra and piano. You don't often get a lot of guitar like Bleach or Naruto. 
 
The overall sounds during fight sequences are very well done. The punches are not to fake sounding, and the Devil Fruit sounds are pretty spot on too. The Japanese voice actors are fitting, and if you watch shonen you will probably recognize some of the voices.  
 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
Like I said before, One Piece is well written and at times the arcs can go very fast and sometimes they can go very slow. I believe that if you make it through the slow parts, you will get to good story lines. It is a very rewarding anime to watch IF you are willing to put the time in.  
 
Overall: 8 
 
A lot of people are turned off by the high episode count. The one thing I say about anime is that you can't judge by how long it is. One Piece doesn't have one major plot, the anime is mostly about Luffy's adventure as a pirate. Each arc has its own plot that sometimes tie into other arcs and become saga. Until this day we don't know if there is going to be an end game opponent.

    ok where to start hmmm.... 
 
the first anime i saw was naruto and after watching all the eps i thought that naruto was the best anime. But by the time i was watching 1 ep a week i started watching bleach. The same thing happened again because i was watching 1 ep a week of bleach and naruto. So, i then started watching one piece (thank god there was enough episodes to keep me going for a while) and to this day i realised that out of those 3 anime one piece was the best and my favourite. 
 
What makes One Piece so great? 
The storyline is good and keeps you guessing to what ""One Piece"" is but then you realise it doesn't matter because the journey is what matters the most. 
It has a great balance of happy and sad. There are alot of times where i have shed tears but also times of tears of joy - this rarely happens in other anime. 
The characters aren't overpowered. This is essential because it adds a sense of realism. Roronoa Zoro is my fave character but he has no devil fruit which makes it more awesome. 
EPIC. It is the most EPIC anime i have seen so far. 
Oda (mangaka for one piece) doesn't overuse death to create emotional scenes. I think this is much harder but it makes it feel more authentic and not cheap. 
Nakama/Friendship. This is probably the best quality of One Piece. Even though Luffy and co are pirates, they will help people because they are good people and value friendship. The Strawhat team pwn. 
Comedy. Yes there are some funny gags :) 
 
What makes One Piece suck? 
The 4kids dub or whatever. stay away from dubbed and stick to subbed. 
That's about it i really can't fault anything else. 
 
P.S read the manga it's really good too

    One Piece was the second anime show i stared watching(the first one being Death Note) and ever since i started i have been a huge fan of both the storyline and some specific characters. 
 
Story: The story of the series unveils around the main protagonist's main ambition to become the King of Pirates, in a world that is ruled by a mysterious government that has five elders at the top. The world of One Piece is unique. It bears no similarity to any other world i've seen in other anime shows, as it is mostly comprised of 5 oceans (along with the Grand Line, in which the treasure is said to be hidden). The man said to have the most freedom in the world is the pirate king because he is not bound by the militaristic government led by the organization of the Marines. And so Luffy sets sail in order to find new nakama for his crew and eventually become the King, with many adventures lying ahead of them. 
 
Art-Sound: The animation techniques could be improved but are quite nice nontheless. The OST's released for each season are quite amusing in my opinion and also quite famous in Youtube. 
 
Character: Probably the most astonishing domain in One Piece is the variety and complexity of the developed charactes. Since the beginning of the storyline many different and unique characters have been shown making it easy for any person to match themselves with one of them and become obsessed. The protagonist  as well as hin nakama illustrate many moral issues and relationships such as friendship, protection of beloved one's, loyalty, trust etc. Also many difficult situations develop such as betrayal. However the combination of different and at all times strong-willed characters makes all of them wasy to like. 
 
Enjoyment: In my opinion anyone watching One Piece has a great time enjoying both the battles and the relationships developed between the characters. Many different abilities are shown via the Devil Fruits,which grant each person an ability. One can be eaten by each person. Until now over 100 different devil fruits ave been shown making the battles interesting and mysterious as one is eager to know the other;s fruit abilities and weaknesses. 
 
I would give the overall score of 10 to One Piece. It is probably my favourite anime  due to its characteristics and the fact that i am obsessed with Luffy. I hope i helped with my review. Thanks for reading, please do comment on your thoughts about this review!!

    This is my first review ever. :) One Piece is one of the best animes I've ever seen because it includes a great plot, amazingly funny characters(especially the main characters), and it has many episodes. 
Throughout the anime, Luffy, the main character meets different people who eventually became his crew mates to go on a journey to find a treasure called One Piece, but as you watch more and more, the plot gets more exciting, complicated, and you'll begin to become a bit anxious for the characters because stronger characters, that are stronger than Luffy, will appear. Overall, this anime has everything: strong & smart characters, A LOT OF COMEDY

    First of all, let me start off by saying that One Piece ! is one of my favourite animes and manga of all time, and before you decide to not watch it, read the reviews ! 
 
One Piece is by far the most outrageous, amazing, tear jerking, hilarious, life changing animes.  It seriously makes me want to drop out of school and become a pirate. 
 
If you think that this is extremely shounen and that girls will not like it; you're extremely right for the first bit.  I'm a teenage girl, and I swear, I would choose One Piece over every other shojo anime out there. Sometimes shonen animes are the best. 
 
[STORY] 
 
The story is intriguing from the very start.  We see this little skinny kid who looks like nothing special, but then *BAM* he shows you what he can do.  If you've read the summary, you'll get the jist, except that the summary leaves out one VERY important detail. 
 
DEVIL FRUIT ! 
 
These are basically fruit that give the consumer powers, and as you watch the series, you will see the most stupid sounding devil fruit, turning out to be the most powerful creation ever ! 
 
The story is funny, but is sserious at times.  There are times when I cried my eyes out, and there are times when I died laughing.  This anime is non-stop hilarity and can not be described any other way. 
 
 
[ART] 
 
The art for the first 200 episodes or so is not the best quality, but is still equally enjoyable.  DO NOT COMPARE THE DUB ART TO THE ORIGINAL.  It has been modified for children etc. and looks absolutely stupid. 
 
Eiichiro Oda's art is often compared to 'Fairy Tail' another shonen anime, but they are both amazing. 
 
The design of the characters is both funny and amazing.  They are so unique and I know I would never be able to compare them to anything else. 
 
[SOUND] 
 
please note, this is for the SUB. 
 
SONGS are amazing, lyrics are truly heartfelt and funny.  They set the story very well using songs and openings etc. 
 
Characters voices are magical, whenever I was reading the manga I had a clear idea of what the voices would sound like, and I'm happy to saw my expectations have been met. 
 
[CHARACTERS] 
 
BEST part of One Piece is how unique and special the characters are.  They are not all 'my mother/father died when I was young and now I wander the seas', no, they are all truly heartfelt, sad stories that are only similar in how heart wrenching they are. 
 
Every back story, every flash back I had truly felt sad at, and it took an extra 3 episodes to un-break my heart ! 
 
[ENJOYMENT] 
 
If you haven't read any of my review, here's a basic shortened version of it; 
 
BEST. ANIME. EVER. 
 
[OVERALL] 
 
Simply the best.  Couldn't ask for a better anime.

    I think the question as to whether you love or hate One Piece has already been answered for most people, myself included. So in this review I don't really want to focus on One Piece as a whole, but rather the half of One Piece that I like to call ""Toei Timeskip."" Whether you love or hate One Piece, it's really hard to deny that its current state is a fucking travesty right now. Damn I'm pretty sure I'd even give pre-Toei timeskip an 8 if I could, but I can't because everything afterward goes down the drain. I was tolerating it for awhile, but they really went full Toei on the Dressrosa arc so my patience has run thin on this anime. 
 
The most glaring issue to me is the pacing. Regardless of whether or not you care for the quality of the show, I'm sure you still want to at least watch some damn anime at the end of the day. Yet you have to go through roughly 5 minutes of the Toei logo, long ass theme song, and the narrator recapping the last episode. Then when you get to the actual show, it's just another 4 minutes of the same shit you saw last episode until it finally gets to the actual content in One Piece. And even then, the actual content might just be a flashback episode or a bunch of unnecessarily drawn out talking/running scenes. I can't tell if this was a ploy from Toei so they wouldn't catch up to the manga as fast or if it was just a way to fill up the 22 minute segment but either way it's infuriating as hell. I just want to watch some goddamn anime, not ""One Piece: Recap Central.""  
 
Another issue is the animation. I have no idea how it got this way. I'm not gonna speculate on whether or not it's because of Toei's big work load on other anime or if they stopped caring, but either way it looks awful. There's so many reused stiff animations that look like super floaty, almost as if the characters all have a devil fruit that lets them fly. It's clear that Toei can do better as their opening themes and movies have good/great animation (second gear in the movies looks orgasmic), but for some reason we are stuck with this animation for now and it looks like it isn't getting any better. To top the animation off, the cheap sound effects make it even more unbelievable. So many sounds are reused that you'll notice it even if you aren't trying to listen for it. Most sounds have this weird static effect attached to it for some reason even if the attack does not call for it. It takes all the impact out of the attacks, the only thing that gives the attacks any impact at all is the VAs which arguably is the only thing carrying One Piece right now.  
 
It's a shame that One Piece is in this state cause it's one of the Shounens I have the most passion about. In its current state it is just a solid 4. I'd recommend reading the manga if you care about seeing the story without any of the bullshit that Toei puts in between. One Piece is really awful right now and I hope it improves in the future.

    Just to get this out right away before this review. This writing will not consist of anime or manga differences, rather you choose to immerse your self into this epic journey by reading the manga or watching the anime is your preferential decision. Personally I am more of a fan of anime then manga, but the manga is a fantastic read if your a manga fan and only like following the main plot points. Also this review will not explore dry details and things that most people should probably already know like the premise of the story or characters at this point since its been running for 20+ years. I will focus instead on outlining the major strengths of this series and reasons why you should jump in.  
 
Good with that being said, lets get onto the review shall we..... :) 
 
 
One piece is another well respected and ambitious shonen series especially in Japan. It is currently the leading crown jewel of shonen in its home country and the most popular manga in the world. Believe me if there is any shonen series out there that deserves this recognition, it is one piece. The series has some of the most incredible cast of characters you'll ever see and witness and some of the most groundbreaking and dramatic backstories along with a very deeply crafted and Imaginative expansive world just full of beauty. There is even a level of poetic heroism that you won’t see in any other shonen that is so unique to oda’s style of immersing you into the experience and helps to establish your connection to these characters and the story presented. 
 
Helmed by Eiichiro Oda himself, the author of one piece has a level of commitment and confidence to his manga that you don’t often see in many mangaka’s careers. One by one Naruto, bleach, fairy tail, hitman reborn, magi. They all fell apart at some point, usually towards the often unplanned or convoluted climax of a story. (Naruto’s 4th world war as an example, Bleach thousand-year blood war arc that kind of materialized out of nowhere and tried to connect events up to the present narrative, hitman reborn’s often un-executed final battle royal tournament arc, Magi’s ridiculous over the top philosophical ending) I have seen enough shonen in my day to truly judge the quality of these series and one thing all large ongoing shonen have in common is they are plagued by inconsistency both in the writing and themes and elements presented. This is a growing trend that is predominant in this genre. This is where one piece greatly differs in this regard. In terms of so many cliché and contrived stories seen throughout shonen or series that end-up derailing into unknown territory. This series really opened my eyes on the same level as like Hunter X hunter did.  
 
 Never does it ever feel like its derailing off track or contradicting its moral code, that is the mechanics and rules written that dictate the structure of the series and its universal principles outlined by the author. This sets the foundation of the many hundreds of episodes and continues along consistently with those established elements. 
 
 Naruto was once a series about Shinobi, kishimoto (the author of Naruto) developed and created his world to be a ninja world with various ninja tools, strategical warfare with many dynamic battles and even a certain degree of physics. Many elements of ninja were still a huge ongoing theme with a more personalized tale in the original Naruto series that conveyed a more humanized reflection in the presentation of the story. However, eventually that ceased to be as many characters became so godly powerful, that many of the traditional mechanics were just forgotten and characters lacked development and never ended up becoming the larger focus. I would have loved to see how kishi developed the weapons expert tenten, or the kind of creative techniques that shino could have used or even Lee becoming a more prominent character in the story. Tamari with her Wind techniques and blades. No instead many characters were reduced to mediocre persona’s living in the shadow of Sasuke and Naruto which are clearly the focal point of the character development and story. The power scaling in other words just felt a bit unorthodox or just uneven as many characters and elements of the series became obsolete.  
 
This is something that does NOT happen with one piece. Characters do grow more powerful as the series progresses, but its confined with-in the rules established and never breaks that barrier feeling like a deconstruction towards a different series. Each individual character be it main, secondary or even villains will go through lots of emotional and physical development.  
 
One of the largest reasons why I have such hope that the ending of one piece will be great, because this man has mapped out and has drawn the final arc of the story from literally a decade ago and has since dropped the bread crumbs often hinting or leaving subtle clues that tie and connect seamlessly to some of the deepest mysteries of the plot. In short you can feel that the show is building towards something with many lingering questions and answers that will eventually come to the forefront of this epic saga. I swear I have seen this show a lot and I am still picking up on certain foreshadowing that was conveyed literally hundreds of episodes ago which later became a huge plot point. This man plans so meticulously, that it literally boggles your mind.  
 
An example “said character will mention something just on the spur of the moment and you don’t think there is no significance to it, only to find out that later on, it is incorporated in the story in a major way with great development for that character and is also hinted subtly a few times throughout the story. Another example. “During a massive incident that shakes the world, you see many people discuss their viewpoints of the government or how the atrocities that took place in the world and their ideological viewpoints of the events. Some characters who you don’t think are very important merely have a few lines of dialogue, only to find out later that said character was a “LEGEND” and a very important historical figure in the one-piece world. Much like Madara or hashirama in Naruto. Oda loves to tease like this and with such subtly, it feels like this man knows exactly what is on the horizon and loves to throw in such amazing Easter eggs to see if viewers are really paying attention. This is also another reason why this series has a huge following of theorists and analytical reviewers.  
 
In terms of the art and style. The diverse and rich universe that oda creates with some of the most impressive world building and the ability to establish each new locale with different laws, cultures, morals, rules, etc. The often exaggerated display of facial expressions and abnormal designs can turn some people off but if you look above that exterior you will notice a unique style that is not used in any other anime with such a wide range of variety that is often hard to interpret just from mere words. Objects and characters represented in the one piece world are often large in scale and tower over the main protagonist in a way that makes you feel their dominance and control that the one piece world is full of such monsters and incredibly powerful adversaries. The significance to this design choice by oda is amazing and really exemplifies the massive threat level conveyed in this world. The anime actually makes this element of the series more prevalent. Also The type of scale the one-piece world has is unprecedented. You will never see a world with such rich lore and world building and oda gets a lot of his ideas from so many other novels, movies, historical references, etc. So, there is bound to be something that you will recognize from other iconic anime or films. Things like Alice in wonderland, The god father, Dragonball, Moby dick, to name a few. 
 
Don't be put off by the often classic style of animation if your watching the anime, because it will evolve over time. Obviously with a show that has started in the early 1990's and is continuing into 2019 will have some changes (sarcasm). Seeing the transition to 16:9 is where you can really see the massive difference.  
 
The Music definitely deserves a mention in this series. Without it, it would not be the same. The music suits the scenes of battle marvelously, it gives the people who's watching seeking for more and more action. The orchestrated trumpets and trombones, mixed with the drums fit the action scenes very nicely and the piano themes that you hear during some of the drama, really creates a powerful scene that is trying to bring out your emotion and just tingles your heart and soul. You really do feel for these characters as almost living in there world. Believe me, you will cry, you will laugh, and you will even get angry during some of the more intense dramatic moments in this show. The background music is also very capable of strengthening suspenseful or triumphant moments. There is just something about it that fits the story of pirates sailing to sea so well. 
 
 
With that all being said, I just want to say that one piece is not an episodic type of series, it is a massive serialization with an overarching narrative, but the core of the series is structured differently than Naruto for example. The series is a more of a character driven narrative and the mystery and lore take kind of a back seat for a while. There is a common misconception where people perceive this series as being very slow paced for that reason and the story does not move to the end goal any time soon but as i said, the driving force of the story is the characters them self's well the mystery and lore are conveyed throughout the journey. Eventually It will come full circle and you will just be in awe at how carefully planned out the plot really was by the ending. You can witness the many clues and hints outlined throughout the plot and details early on that have a ground breaking significance later in the story.  
 
In closing i want to say I know most people are turned off by it because of how intimidating it can be with its nearly 900 episodes and 900+ chapters of content and still on going. But rest assured this is not pokemon, it is a deeply well developed and expansive story with rich lore and world building and it’s about journeys, adventure and mystery that will sure to intrigue you to no end. Check this one out if you’re a fan of anything shonen.

    This is a new review; I found out after watching 29 episodes of One Piece, I realized I made the original review too early.  
Okay first off;  
Story: The story of One Piece is so much different to everything else I've watched, I like One Piece and gave the story an 8 because it's something I myself haven't seen something as planned out and consistent as this, although it has major flaws, for example the fillers... I'm kind of happy I haven't waited week-by-week to watch the 319 episodes I have currently watched,  I would of been disappointed to of been given 3 months worth of filler... Although; some of the filler episodes are very interesting and actually make you want to watch them, namely during the Enies Lobby Arc, I will not mention anything that can be classed as spoilers so I'll leave the story section of this review here.  
 
The art, On my first review I found the art to be very poor; not realizing that One Piece was released in 1999(The Anime) so I gave this a very low rating the first time, but as I have gotten further on with the story I have noticed many changes to the art and fighting styles all of the characters use and how much it has improved, and I'm not even up-to-date with One Piece, I literally can't wait to see the complete development of this series, although waiting every week for this show will be a killer.I rated the new art style an 8. 
 
The sound; I found the opening theme tunes well fitted for this series and a lot of work was put in, Usopp's songs and so-on so forth. The Opening theme tune is very catchy for every arc and makes you enjoy watching them from start to finish, it kinda makes you feel like watching more and more every time you hear it. The sound was rated an 8. 
 
Well, not on to the second most vital point of any anime I watch and write my reviews on... The Characters, I find the character development for One Piece amazing, you learn about every one of Luffy's Nakama's past and how they ended up where and how they are, wanting to achieve their goals and will stop at nothing to do so, and with Luffy as the captain, who says that's impossible?! This section I rated 9, as I have thoroughly enjoyed watching every character develop and seeing what they turn out like and how they can overcome the impossible on a daily basis.  
 
It's finally time, this is the most vital point in any type of anime you can watch - Enjoyment, with this whole series, the first 50 or so episodes, I thought about stopping; reaching a certain landmark and just carrying on when I can be bothered, I'm glad I didn't do that. This has instantly become a favorite of mine, making me WANT to watch more and I just enjoy watching almost every episode, I rated the enjoyment factor for One Piece a 9. 
 
Overall: 9 
I have given the overall summary of One Piece a 9 in my opinion, it's so amazing that I didn't think I would like this show; I took it on with a whim and I don't regret that one bit, One Piece teaches you so many life rules, abiding by your own justice and doing what you feel is right and not what the world thinks of it, if you think it's right, go at it whole-heartedly and you won't be disappointed with yourself, Luffy believes in his friends and Nakama to the bitter end knowing they are capable of overcoming everything and I find that the deepest bond between them all, it just sets everything in motion. I have enjoyed re-writing this review; I will leave my old review below for comparison for people wishing to judge One Piece too early, like what I done.  
 
-This review was wrote on Nov 7th 2013- 
""With this show, I've found that the art-work isn't as what I personally expected, I find that other long running shows have much better artwork, for example Bleach, or Naruto... Although I've only just started to watch this series, I can't see the artwork changing too much.  
 
I find that the story plot is quite impressive, looking for the most valuable treasure in the land on a huge journey, gathering members, and as of what I've watched, it's a decent pace for a long running, as it has been going since 1999, which is impressive in itself, 14 years?! That is a a standard in itself.  
 
I found the characters very interesting, like I said, I'm a new watcher so getting to know the characters very early is a good thing, the way Luffy obtained his most precious treasure and Zoro started to learn his three sword technique and their goals. I found that to catch my attention, and a lot of thought was put into these episodes explaining their pasts.  
 
I used to dislike the thought of watching One Piece, but I have eagerly changed my mind, last year I watched 3 episodes, got bored and switched it off, I have came back (Was looking for some new stuff to watch) and I don't regret it, I have enjoyed this show - Only on episode 29, but started 3 days ago(4th Nov 2013). 
 
I have rated the show an overall 9. I am enjoying it, but the thing I am most let down by is the art work, I understand that for a 1999 production, this is probably a lot more advanced, and brings me back to the times I watched Tenchi Kyo-Ryo-Ohki or, a personal favorite of mine; Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, they were, and still are excellent shows, even with their artwork, and I hope this turns out to be the same. 
 
Thank you for reading, I hope this is helpful to anyone looking to watch this anime.""

    OK this is my first review so here it goes, 
 
One Piece(OP) is a fantastic story about friendship, hard work, determination, and chasing your dreams. This show was one of the first animes that i ever watched and inspired me to continue watching anime. If you like idiotic humor, kick-ass action, and a touching story with very lovable characters, One Piece is the show for you. 
 
Story 10/10 
This story is all about the voyage of Monkey D. Luffy as he gathers up crew members and they experience many trials that will test their friendship and ultimately deepen their bond as they sail across the Grand Line. I love how this story develops early on as the original members are acquired. Not only are they accompanying Luffy and aiding him on his journey, but they are also chasing their own dreams as well.  
Now, about the oh so familiar fillers, compared to the other long running animes OP isn't jammed packed with fillers. In the beginning it moves pretty fast but as it catches up to the manga the story definitely slows in pace. Although there are less fillers, they are present but i found them to be very enjoyable. There are multiple filler arcs that last for multiple episodes but they fit in perfectly with the story. The reason these arcs are so enjoyable are because of the characters. 
 
Characters 10/10 
The main characters of OP are definitely my favorite part about the show. They all have great personalities that compliment each other. There are the idiot comic relief members,the voice of reason members, the bad-ass members, and the weak/support type characters of the crew. I'm not going to sit here and say that i love every character every episode; i've had my fair share of times were each has angered me in the way. But it's that exact feeling that makes you fall in love with the crew. Just like our own friends we have all had times when we hated our friends and its times like those that help friendships grow to be even stronger then before. The ups and downs of the crew as they grow to be closer nakama (a term VERY often used in the show) will have you yearning for more as you begin to hope for their dreams as much as they do. 
 
Sound 10/10 
Music is also a huge part of OP and adds a lot to the overall feel of the show. First off the opening songs for the show never disappoint and i find the opening to set the mood and can get you pumped each episode in a season. Not only are the opening songs fantastic, but each character has his own theme music. Each character has his or her own BGM that play when its his/her time to shine. 
 
Art 9/10 
OP's art is good and unique, that being said i still think it is a step down from other popular series (like Naruto or Bleach). By no means is it bad, i find its subtle uniqueness to be very appealing if you're looking for something a little bit different. I enjoy watching and couldn't imagine the characters portray any other way. 
 
Overall 10/10 
I love this show and it is definitely one of my favorites. It is a great shounen battle and i highly recommend it to anyone willing to take the 500+ episode leap. As someone who watched 415 episodes basically nonstop and has been watching it weekly ever since. It is never too soon, and never too late, to take the journey with Luffy and his crew across the Grand Line on a rollercoaster of emotion for the ultimate treasure ONE PIECE.

    Maybe it's a bit late, but this year I decided to catch up with One Piece. I have seen 296 episodes so I think (and hope) I am eligible of writing a review. My native language is not English so bear with me if I make mistakes of any kind. Also this is my first review. If someone would ask me to review this show in one sentence I would tell him the following: ""This show is a masterpiece"". I have to note that this review is solely based on my opinion and everyone has the right to have an opinion should that be bad or good. I am not saying that other people are wrong. So, let's start the review... 
 
Story 
 
The story is the greatest I have seen in a anime. It has a bit of everything: drama, comedy, action. At first it may seem that this is a comedy anime, but the more you watch it the more surprised you will be, because of the seriousness this show can deliver when it is needed. It has a perfect balance between comedy and drama. The story can be so deep that at some point you may even shed a tear. 
 
Art 
 
Despite of all the negative things people said about the art, I, personally really enjoy it. I can say that from the first episode the art was great in my opinion, but it keeps getting better and better after each episode. After I saw  some flashbacks of the first episodes I was really surprised of how much the art developed since then.  
 
Sound 
 
The sound of this show is really good. The OST (original soundtrack) really adds a good feel to the story. At the very dramatic moments it makes it even more dramatic, which is a really nice thing. 
 
Character 
 
One of the best thing in this show are the characters. The makers of this anime really made a good job bringing you close to the characters. I feel like I am on their ship, sailing with them and when they got some problems I can really feel their pain and suffering. The voice actors do a really great job (I watch it in Japanese version, I don't know about the English version, because I haven't seen it) and every character is unique in its own way. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
The enjoyment of this anime is outstanding. I could never get bored of it, because it keeps getting better every episode. Eiichiro Oda, the mangaka, does a great job in writing awesome stories with nice plot twists. 
 
Overall 
 
Overall this anime is a masterpiece. As I said earlier, I didn't write any review before this, but I felt this anime really deserved one and I wanted to express my feelings about it.

    I stressed enough as this anime is only ranked 58 on the list(LETS GET ONE PIECE TO THE TOP GUYS) 
ive either gotten several negative responses when i mention One Piece  
1- Its too long 
2- (usually mentioned by fan-girls) Death Note FTW!(which i dont think it derserves to have such a high rating) 
3- Ewww that anime is ugly 
4- naruto/bleach is better 
5- Ive seen the dub it sucks bawls 
Ill try not to write any spoilers and make it brilliant as possible 
Story 10/10 
Luffy a young 17 year old, who has eaten the Gomu Gomu Devil Fruit making him a rubber man, aspires to be the Pirate King, his carefree personality makes him the main character of the story and we follow him and his crew on his path to being the Pirate King, the great arcs one ive loved much was the Enies Lobby arc which was quite amazing 
Unlike certain Animes which have no ability kill anyone off One Piece has plenty of such things making the Anime an emotional one. 
I remember when i was 9 the dubbed version by 4kids was absolutely horrid i remembered no blood or anything to being with  One piece should get a a different dubbers infact without looking at the art to much or the voice acting i thought the story sounded quite great here i am watching it again 6 years later but this time on the subbed version, please don't watch the dubs,  
Art 10/10 
So what if the art is funny looking it fits like a glove onto the type of this anime one piece is funny its meant to be funny it should be denied because of art style i mean its more then 10 years old as we progress in the story my current time is 2011 the art get clearer  
Sound 10/10 
Every sound and background in one piece as id liked to imagine it fits perfect with the scene or current arc to make a scene sound badass or completely stupid 
Characters 10/10 
every character in One piece has a back story a childhood not one character is left out its deeply thought about and very deep, in most flashbacks which every different character usually has all the stories connect, every backstory ive seen so far is very touching and emotional thus making make score a 10/10 
Enjoyment 10/10 
Every battle scene in One Piece is Badass they always somehow try to beat there opponent no matter what its a common theme but no matter how much stronger the opponent they always have a resolve. 
Overall 10/10 
overall this Anime is really great i recommend it MAKE ITS NUMBER ONE ON RANK GUYS its really tempting i watch the entire series well i caught up to it in under a month. But one of my favorite arcs was Enies Lobby and if you cant wait once you caught up go read the anime

    A short reivew for the reader without much time: 
Story (7/10): The story is typical of a shonen anime, a team of friends going on a mission to find something they want. Each of the arcs are a battle against another pirate gang. 
Art (8/10): The art is what one first notices about One Piece. It is unusual and makes the series unique. However, people judge the anime for its art, and this doesn't do it justice. Just watch the anime, and you will notice the art works well with the anime. 
Sound (6/10): The music is interesting, and doesn't exactly match the anime, but is still a pretty good choice. 
Character (9/10): The characters are what make this anime. They are all unique in their personality and design. Their fighting techniques are all interesting in their own way, and all add to the comedy of the anime. 
Enjoyment (8/10): Highly enjoyable, very funny and entertaining. 
Overall (8/10)

    One Piece is one of those unique animes that stand out among thousands of others.Oda the creator, is one of the best of the best. 
 
 
 
PROS: 
-story and characters are well defined, as the story develops so does the characters. 
- each character is unique in different ways and each of them have different goals. 
-one piece is ""shounen"" it has a lot of action, comedy and emotional at times. never fails to disappoint. 
- sound is superb, creates an atmosphere which other animes fail accomplish. 
- ""Pirates"" one piece is one of the few animes who like to explore other cultures and isnt very traditional to the Japanese anime. 
 
CONS: 
- the only downside of one piece, is that the artworks are different than what most animes are use to. but it does not matter because its about pirates, not ninjas.

    i've been a fan of this  serie since  a lot  of years ago. I dropped the anime when it started the previous saga to the actual one (punk Hazard, i guess), that means that i hav not seen a single chapter in three years. 
 
This series could be a very huge one, but it has some negative things. 
 
- the development of the plot lacks completely  of  fluency. The narrative of the chapters got worse, more or less since... Fisherman Island. Oda is obsesed about telling what is doing every strawhat, and that it's quite tiring. If you substract the op, the ending, and the resume, the chapter will get reduced to 10 minutes. Surprise! It won't happen anything in that time. The thing that names the chapter will happen at the  last moment, so you'll have to wait another delicious week. 
 
-The obsesion of oda, of being always telling the past of the characters, olds and news. I found this aspect disgusting and pityful. Would not it be better, if you'd insinuate things about the character instead of let out all the information?  It's horrible being in the middle of a great saga, and  realize we have got involved in a 10-chapters flashback. I can understand it with the  main characters, but Oda NEEDS TO DO IT WITH EVERY ONE. I DO NOT CARE ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THEIR LIVES. 
 
Those two aspects, made me take a little..... 3 years break. I don't know if i will see it again. 
 
The art has become poorer and poorer. Neves have been an important thing, but some of the last chapters i saw weren't very well animated. And the Tits of Namy and Robin looks like an universe in continue expansión. Those two used to be, 2 sexy chicks. 
 
That's only my humble opinion. It's still a nice series, but i can't follow it week by week. Or my pity and disgust will overpass me and i'll became a monster. Probably. 
 
However, in general is fine. Music can be very surprising, there are very epic moments (and there will be) and each time i listen ''we are'' i only can say..... that crap was good (in the good sense)

    This anime is really the greatest i've watched so far. 
The way it has been drawn is very unique and simple and everything is very detailed. 
The story is great, imo better than Naruto &amp; Bleach.

    Story: One Piece plot follows a standard shonen formula; Monkey D Luffy, main protagonist, is a young boy who is chasing a dream of becoming a Pirate King. On a road to his dream, he encounters many different characters, some of which become his crew mates, enemies, allies and so on. To become a Pirate King, one has to be stronger than any other pirate and to get to the island called Raftel, where lies the biggest mystery of the anime, which is called ""One Piece"". Only thing we know about ""One Piece"", is that it is some kind of a treasure that last Pirate King, Gold D Roger left on Raftel, and for a vast majority of an anime, it was in question if it really exists. Anything more than this would be major spoiler, so this is as much as I can say about plot. Concept of an anime is fairly simple. Straw Hat Pirates are traveling from island to island in search for Raftel and One Piece, and every island has its own story, problems and characters, which sums into one arc. Pacing is pretty good, with arcs being long from 5 to 30 episode, depending on impact it has on the whole saga , with small fillers between major arcs. In general, anime starts off in a great way, with Luffy collecting his crew in first 5 to 6 arcs, and after establishing a full pirate gang, anime sets off to encounter some of the greatest enemies I have seen. It all builds up to Paramount War Arc, which is one of the greatest shonen arcs in my opinion. After that, anime goes into 2 year time skip, where we can see a great example of character, art and story progression, and its only getting better. Time skip brought us new standard of quality, with every post time skip arc is in one league higher than its pre time skip predecessors. Sagas have bigger number of episodes, all the arcs are really connected, which can be reflected in how taking down one enemy (as Doflamingo) has a big impact in things to come. So, for the story part, it would be a jeopardy to give it anything less than 10. 
 
Art/Animation: One Piece started at the end of 1999, so animation was somewhat sketchy and it was a turn off point for many of my friends whom I recommended it. It was not easy for me either, but as I was watching only Naruto at time, I had to watch something else while waiting for new episode. So, I dug in deep without looking back, and it paid off after an arc of two. Although it was not the most beautiful animation, it was unique. After some time, I did not even matter about it, because the story was so good. After few years in, anime was starting to look more and more good. Fights were looking better, world building was nice, water animation became good (which you imagine is important, because a big portion of an anime is set on water). And then the time skip came. Prior to time skip, animation was evidently on a good level, just watch paramount war, and you will see what I mean. But when the time skip hit, it was like a brand new anime. It must be said that after 500+ episodes, characters and anime as a whole need some refreshment. And boy, it was so good. After the paramount war, it was a bit calm, story needed little rest, and everything just went quiet. Time skip was a shaker in every aspect, and from then on, watching from just animation and art perspective, I have not seen a single flaw. One Piece is that cannot slack of with animation, as it has a lot of characters with many different powers, from fluid arm extending, over the sharp blade cutting and gun shooting, so variety of animation is a must. At this moment in time, Wano arc is few episodes in, and new comic-like art is just phenomenal, maybe the best One Piece had to this date. So, I will conclude the story of animation with a strong 9, because it will really reward you if you can survive first couple of arcs. 
 
Sound: Lets start with openings. One Piece openings are usually spoiler free, with just a glimpse of main event and enemies of the arc, with action filled sounds, right suited for a shonen. What catches my ear is that they all sound simmilar and are not that impressive,and as arcs can last for many episodes, so can opening, which can annoy from time to time. On the other hand, soundtrack variety that anime has is really great. Silly and casual soundtracks are pretty funny, which is great, but real deal comes with battle sounds. Every sound is really able to capture the moment, so on just hearing the soundtrack, you have flashbacks on some of the more significant moments, for example, moment when Luffy strikes a celestial dragon is jaw dropping and well rounded with awesome soundtrack (its called Luffy's Fierce Attack I think). Just because OPs are not that good (do not get me wrong, they are not bat, just not my cup of tea), I will give sound a 9. 
 
Characters: This is probably, besides story, where One Piece shines the most. It would be a horror if, in now almost 900 episodes, characters do not have proper back stories or progressions. Oda took his time and made every character different from others, which is really well exploited in pirate crew idea, where you need different people for different tasks. Luffy is clumsy captain, not very intelligent, but very warm hearted, strong and stubborn. While his looks do not tell much, just wait until battle starts, to see his abilities exploited at their maximum. He is that character that can understand everyone's feelings and can be there to help when you have a hard time. He is also that lawful good  guy, who does not have a problem with sparing enemies life or even teaming up with enemy, he is not a killer after all,  just a kid chasing his dreams. On the other hand you have Zoro, the Swordsman, Luffy's right hand and the first crew member Luffy has recruited. He was pirate hunter, but became a pirate himself after Luffy stubbornly persuaded him. He is that cold hearted, power-seeking guy, somewhat of a polar opposite to Luffy, and on the other hand, has moral laws that cannot be run over. He has does not care about women (at least that is what he is showing on the surface), has no sense of direction and other silly traits which need to be there to balance his cool personality, it certainly would not be cool to have a guy that is eponymous of awesome without any weight on his legs to hold him down on earth. Sanji, the cook, Zoro's arch enemy (metaphorically), is that pervy guy every good shonen needs, and oh boy, isn't he lucky with those chicks onboard his ship? Although being horny 24/7, do not dare to touch a woman in his surroundings, or you will experience the black leg style, Sanji's martial arts ability. Every other crew member is equally interesting, but lets sum this all up by saying that Oda really had done a great job with all those characters. Because every saga is pretty long, there is enough time and exposure for many side characters to be well covered as well, so they are pretty memorable as well. That might just be the case because of Luffy's befriending abilities, so in every arc Straw Hats makenew friend, who are often important helpers in later dangers that our protagonist find them self into. So, without a doubt, characters are getting a big 10. 
 
Enjoyment: I think it can be seen that I am quite moved by this anime, which is a case indeed, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. It may be long, but believe me, you wont be sorry about a single minute spent on watching One Piece. I was a bit reserved to begin with, but as time went on, and arc after arc was good, building up to paramount war and time skip, following only great arcs after that tend to be better than the ones before, I can say that enjoyment is guaranteed. Shortened versions I would not recommend, simply because you will lack in experience, because One Piece is not purely fighting anime, it has a pretty back stories and character dialogues that tend to be cut out in those shortened versions.So, without further ado, it is a big 10 for personal enjoyment. 
 
Overall: To conclude it, with arithmetic mean of 9,67 and a favourite bonus, I cannot give this anime any less than 10. Also, I cannot see this score falling down with things to come, as manga material looks promising, and new animation of Wano arc really brings something special in it, so I am really looking forward episodes to come.

This is my first review and i hope that most of you wil find it helpful.One piece is one of the best animes ive seen so far.I started off with naruto and bleach, and then later One piece after my friend told me about it.He was like&quot;Man there's this amazinggg anime called one piece that you should start watching, im alredy on episode 57,im hooked on to it,i cant stop watching ....BlahBlahBlah&quot;.So,when i got home i watched the first episode of OP and said&quot;wat the @#$%^&quot;.(at the beginning of the anime)The effects and quality( art )of the anime were horrible and the main character looked like a complete retard(to me).And i knew that there was no way i was gona get hooked on to this anime.I called up my friend and told him about it, and he said that thats what he also thought at first ,but after watchin a few episodes he completely changed his mind.So i decided to watch a few more episodes. Without even realizing it i was drawn into the anime(by the time you get to episodes 20-30 it gets intresting).The story got way better as i progressed through the anime and i enjoyed every single episode i watched. The characters also got way better. The main caracter (whom i thought was a retard at first) became my favorite anime character. He's cool (although he doesnt look it) and funny and will make you laugh so hard till you cry( this also applies to the other characters). Some fighting scenes(main ones)in the anime are INSANE, the music is beautiful,and the sad scenes in the anime will bring you soo close to tears( many people actually cried. i wsnt one of them....BELIEVE ME, I WASNT!!. but i got close to crying). The art and sound in the anime also get a lot better later on but you  wouldnt really care about them bcz youd be soo hooked on to the anime by the that time.I dont wanna write so much so ill just end this by saying that for those of you who havent started watchin this anime..START NOW!!! ,cause ull regret it if you dont.SAYONARA!!!

    One Piece - The ""Shonen Jump"" King 
 
I like One Piece. I like One Piece quite a lot in fact, but the issue comes from how insanely long the series is currently residing at 873 chapters and the staggering extent of its world which according to the OPW (One Piece Wikipedia) has named 870 characters.  
 
What I'm going to do is to explain what I consider some of the fundamental aspects of the series and so it comes the appeal of One Piece. I first encountered One Piece in 2015 on an anime event called Iberanime, in Portugal and unbeknownst to me at the time, what I was looking for was a mass success. I really came to enjoy the adventures of Nami, Zoro and of course Luffy as the first Straw Hat Pirates to appear (technically). The series had a unique place illness to it that made it stand out from other more shonen series I'd seen up to this point like Naruto or Dragon Ball and even the show's more dramatic moments there was a tremendous amount of fun to be had. Of course, as I read the imaginative pirate adventures within the first volumes, what I was completely unaware of was what a world shattering phenomenon I was actually dealing with and that revelation would only appear to me two years later when I find out what a massive deal One Piece really is inside Japan. 
 
The main appeal of this series is the simple premise of adventure and I know that's also the concept of countless other shounen series but nothing really captures the same sense of exploration and scale as the world of piracy, in the series. The hero on this voyage is a young pirate named Monkey D. Luffy, a basic character with a simple purpose to find the mysterious treasure named One Piece and with that, becoming the King of the Pirates. This is Luffy's primary motivator from Chapter 1 and remain until the latest chapter, and this keeps Luffy's journey along the one distinct path which is something unique to One Piece which is the same journey along the same path to the point that you can charge Luffy's route on a physical map (in which the crew encounters various island and territory) and this makes the story very easy to understand since allows to a massive amount of variety in the series sub-arcs like Baroque Works or Dressrosa in which the crew must untangle a web of political intrigue and take down a tyrannical false king, for example. The type of stories are unlimited since it started off fairly with a basic villain or villains but as we move on, people see the Straw Hats embroiled in government conspiracies or haunted ghost ships, jailbreaks and even being at the center of a large scale war like Marineford and this is what makes it the show. 
 
I really don't like some major plot incidents that are separate from the Straw Hats but when they occur, they reverberate throughout the world on such a scale that it drastically affects the lives of every character in it, such as my favorite character, Portgas D. Ace or the Yonko ""WhiteBeard"" (Shirohige) even though One Piece (as series) succeeds on a large scale. There are also a lot of very strong characterizations in the series, but one of the things that are a bit strange for anime and manga connoisseurs is the difference between the two versions where the 'x factor' of each person enters. For each person, the information they have so far is incipient phase what still remains to be known why everything is called into question. Because there is a lack of known and unknown information from the series, concrete examples can not be given with arguments, but it is a difficult problem to argue. The viewer is aware of what he sees, how the characters react (what is later compared to real personalities), and how everything that exists in the shape of the characters actually comes into being. From now, just trust me when I say that nobody writes a story like Eiichiro Oda and with that, you need to see to believe (that's an old Portuguese saying).

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~SPOILER FREE REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
This review is for those who think ""one piece is shit and think one piece is too long, so who's gonna watch it""..  
anyways, i have given episode guide in the last. :-)  
PLOT: 10/10 
among all the animes i have seen, One piece has the biggest plot among them all, the vastness of one piece plot is beyond measure as compare to other animes. 
Character Development: 
9/10 
(TO EACH TO THEIR OWN) 
Character development of one piece character is Dope. It's like when they are visiting new places, they are learning new things and understanding new people's feeling and learning about the truth of world government and crimes and injustice in this world. 
One thing i like the most about the theme of one piece is ""They don't follow the rules, they make their own rule"". 
+ one piece contains upto 500 characters and each one have their own character development. It's not just about hero being punching everyone in his way, they all have their own character development. 
Characters information: 
Monkey.D Luffy: (8/10) (Main character) 
Well.. About Luffy.. He's an idiot (no doubt :D ) but there are times when he made decisions which totally describes that why he's the captain in his crew and why others are not, despite the fact that each member of his crew have more intellectual level than luffy. 
""Sure.. He's an idiot, but that's why he's our captain."" ~Zoro 
Roronoa Zoro: (10/10) 
A badass three sword-style user swordsman and right hand of luffy. Though he have a bad sense of direction (almost too bad) but his morale value are way too much ! He is one of those character which will make you hooked to the one piece and loyal to it. (not gonna say much about him to avoid spoilers) 
Nami: (8/10) 
Navagator of the crew who has lust and greed for money. Probably the heroin of one piece (not luffy's fiance though, not even close). 
Usopp: (7/10): 
Usopp the sharp shooter (LOL exaggerated,) or should i say , ""Usopp the Lier"". 
Sanji (10/10): 
Cook of the straw hat pirates, who only uses legs in fight. (pretty badass ain't it?) 
(not including other characters to avoid spoilers). 
OST: 7/10 
Ost are decent , not gonna say they are awesome but some ost will make goosebumps .. <3 
Opening/Ending song: 7/10 
they are decent. For example: you can listen to ""oh we share the music"". 
Pacing: 6/10 
Now this is the major weak point of one piece. The pacing of one piece is quite slow. 
Animation: 6/10 
the reason why people say that one piece sucks is not because 
of the story, or the plot , or the character, it's the animation studio a.k.a toei animation that sucks. well the animation .... well to be precise: 
animation isn't on par with the dope plot and character development of one piece.  
(Well it keeps getting better and better though) 
It's still better than naruto though :3 
Gore: 6/10 
blood is quite shown in this anime but not like ""cutting in half, ripping head off"" etc 
Fights: 9/10 
THEY ARE DOPE. 
Overall enjoyment: 10/10 
believe me, once you are hooked to one piece, you can't stop watching. I'm not a one piece fan boy , I just state the facts. I was the same as you guys who didn't watch one piece but said it's shit .. but ! after watching it my review completely changed! 
Episode guide: 
So , what scares people the most is the amount of episodes of one piece which is 783 up to date (quite long though). 
and when people start watching early episodes they say "" this anime is not that good the way it is hyped""  
well How can you judge an anime which has 700+ episode by watching 10 to 20 episode? it's not even it's 10% episode ! 
so I'm gonna rate one piece episodes so that you can understand and make up your mind while watching it. 
Episode List: 
1 to 50: (6/10) 
50 to 220: (7/10) 
226 to 370: (8/10) 
382 to 491: (10/10) (yes! it's a 10/10) 
493 to upto date: (9/10) 
Keep these ratings in mind while watching one piece.

    I'm writing this review in the year of 2017. I will not bore you with a summary of One Piece There are three major setbacks that I find with One Piece and I'm sure many will agree with me. 
 
First, the pacing of this anime is slow. The OP is 2:30 minutes compared to the standard 1:30 minute most are used to. The recap of the current arc takes 3:00. Then there is a 2:00  
minute preview for the next episode. That only leaves 15 minutes for actual story.  
 
Second, the character designs is ugly. The villains have cartoonish appearances which eliminates any feeling of threat. The marines are basically fodder just like hollows is in Bleach. The only marines that could possible pose a threat to Luffy and his crew are the admirals. Whenever there are emotional moments it's totally destroyed by the silly facial expressions. Snot dripping, eyes bulging, mouth gaping, this is just unrealistic and hideous. 
 
Third, there isn't enough deaths in One Piece and when there is a death it's just used at a plot tool. I'm no saying I want everyone to die, but I'm saying that having people die due to the heinous methods of a villain will add more suspense.  
 
Also there are some things that need to be said about Luffy and his crew. I will first name the person and give my thoughts on that person.  
 
We all now Luffy is the captain, but he never acts like one instead he just eats, jokes around, and acts like an idiot. It's Nami that takes responsibility and acts more like a captain then anyone else. Personally Nami would be a better captain in terms of directing the crew through a thunderstorm or battle. She is the third smartest person in One Piece and clearly has expertise in navigation and weather.  
 
Ussop there isn't much to say about him since his character doesn't change one bit. He still lies and acts cowardly in the face of danger. He serves no role on the ship, except to make some gadgets and fix the ship if need be. Ussop isn't necessary for the crew, even though his compassion for others and loyalty is something to be admired. But let's face it, he couldn't save his friends despite him wanting to.  
 
Sanji well there isn't a doubt that he is a good chef and awesome fighter, but Sanji has this annoying quirk (Which you should know already). It's just a poor excuse for comedy relief. If Sanji was to get rid of that side of him then I would be content to have him on the crew. 
 
Zorro is awesome. I have nothing against him except for the fact that he is directionally challenged and has green hair. Zorro is essential to the crew as he serves as vice captain and is a master of the three sword style which cuts down fodder like a god. If it wasn't for Zorro then this show would be over. Love you bro. 
 
Nico Robin; she has a very tragic past (Like all the others only more tragic.) and it's easy to sympathize with her. I find her comments in the face of danger hilarious. Sadly Nico really doesn't do anything for Luffy's crew except dump exposition about ""lost history"" and snap people's necks. If anything though she is powerful due to her advantage of instantly killing people once she sees them. She would make a great assassin. I love you Nico but you don't really need to be on a pirate crew. 
 
Chopper; This lil' ol' fella is a mascot and nothing more. Yes, he serves as a doctor, but that's all. Besides he is a reindeer which just makes him look irresponsible for a doctor. Doctors are supposed to look professional and clean. Chopper is tiny and goofy. I wouldn't trust my life in his hands or hooves I guess.  
 
Brook; Again he has a tragic story and maybe on par with Nico Robin. Regardless Brook doesn't need to be on the crew for his only purpose is to tell cheesy jokes and play music. His jokes are funny at first, but gets old real fast until you just wanna rot in a cell and turn into a skeleton.  
 
Franky; I just wanna say this guy looks ugly! I'm gonna barf if I don't move on to the next character.  
 
One Piece; One Piece is a cool dude with amazing abilities. He has mastered all of the haki types, and can consume as many devil fruits as he wants. With just a stroke of his hand he can make berries turn into pure gold. One Piece is serious when it comes to fighting and he doesn't like to joke around much either. In my opinion One Piece is my favorite character.

    One Piece will be the kind of show that you are thankful to have continued watching. Like starting Madoka Magica, or Clannad or heck even Game of Thrones, it's something that only gets better and better. Unlike Bleach or Fairy Tail and Naruto, the first few episode doesn't immediately show-off an epic fight or get your pity--OP is pretty chill in the beginning. 
Take Anohana for example: in Anohana, the first 11 episodes were slow, but they were buildup for that last episode--the awesome last ep that squeezed your heart and tear-ducts dry. For One Piece, the story really starts rolling until they get five crew members, which is like 50 eps in. After that, 700 episodes of awesomeness awaits you. 
The core of the show is about wonder--Luffy wants to be the Pirate King because he believes that the Pirate King is the freest person in the World. He is a Pirate by his own standards, not killing or pillaging, and instead helping people with his life on the life cuz he freaking wants to. But there is so much more to this show--it's silly, it's light-hearted, it's dumb fun to watch all the adventures he and his crew go through. But still, some scenes are packed with much more meaning and personal stakes that makes it difficult to turn away.  
As much as I love One Piece, I recommend to stop watching the anime and switch to the manga when you get to the Dressrosa Arc. This is where the anime suffered due to stretching out the anime to converting one chapter per episode--diluting the tension of the show to zero. (Golden rule of anime is to convert two chapters of manga per animated episode). (You know, so the show wouldn't catch up to where the manga currently is and suffer the same problem as AOT/SNK and have to stop for 4 years). The Manga has fantastic pacing, it's only any of the adaptations, be it dub or sub, 4Kids or Toei that change the story. 
Become part of the OP fam. 
You're welcome.

    TO PEOPLE WHO CRIES OVER THE NUMBER OF EPISODES: GO READ THE MANGA. It's faster, addictive, beautiful background and still with funny jokes, and you waste less time with unnecessary frames of a character's face of suspense. Disadvantage: You'll loss the amazing and memorable seiyuu actors of each character, beautiful fighting scenes, and the amazing openings/endings they have. 
 
My introduction: I love One Piece since it aired on TV (Brazil) with few episodes. Besides the brazilian dubbing were extremely awful, it's story got stuck in my head: ""Did he already found One Piece? What it was?"". And then I found the sequel at Skypiea saga. 
 
OK LET'S GO 
 
Story (9): Every Island, and every character got deep story/past. the winning and funny moments gets repetitive to you give all your heart in it and then Eiichiro Oda can smash your heart and your soul with his hands. Some societies, government, objects also have deep story.  
   The thing really irritates me is the filler. Everytime they want to put a new monster/friend/enemy with unique powers and want strawhat's crew to solve it in a few episodes. Dude, to the story gets OK they have to kick enemy's asses, clarify mysteries, and let some message to spectators. YOU CAN'T DO ALL THIS IN FEW EPISODES IT GETS MESSY, that's why Oda's work last a lot of chapters. If they need to do a filler, make something off-story, nothing too deeper, just an episode for fun. 
 
Art (9): This part is where I'm really annoying. Look, I don't care about it's traces since they've changing a lot each arc, improving and getting better. But seriously, why is it getting so colorful? The tons of colors are getting annoying in background, and side characters that don't need it. Seems like the TV series are trying to convince children's audience to keep watching by adding a lot of vibrant colors. The only need to put a vibrant color was to a character with a significant meaning to the plot, and now it's in everywhere. It's cute but makes a unnecessary mess. This is one of the (dumbest) reasons I recommend people to read manga. That's my -1 for Colors. But +5 for improving traces, +2 improving attack effects, +3 Gorgeous backgrounds. 
 
Sound (9): The soundtrack are gorgeous, I would really love it if they use more of the old ones. Some sound effects seems already used from another series (like dragonball) and I don't have any reference of a remarkable original sound effect from this series that make me jump OH I KNOW WHERE THIS CAME FROM, only for OST. 
 
Character (10): GURARARARA. oh damn, characters. That's masterpiece seriously. Each one have a memorable lore, or habit, or laugh, even the shape of the body. Well, I can't say that for most female characters tho. Their costumes, clothes are unique. And oh my Lord, the seiyuu they choose for each character are REALLY accurate.  
 
Enjoyment (9): If you're watching few episodes, this is your gold moment to laugh, find those videos of funny moments strawhats and give them a like, but the jokes overeactions from characters are getting too repetitive in anime, but manga is still good. 
 
Overall (10): I know I rate mostly 9 in each type, but I'm giving it a 10 since there're few works that could achieve 5 types and combine very well together with few failures.

    A very good anime, with one of the best character constructions, AWESOME fights and bringing cool messages. 
The soundtrack combines well with the atmosphere of freedom of the anime, the ""abstract"" art makes the anime express itself better, very funny, character INCREDIBLY well worked and with sad/exciting moments that do u never stop crying... 
After the *** S *** (I censored to haven't spoilers ) it changed a little, but it was purposely. Oda give a shock of reality in the characters and, mainly, in the fans that... is not spoilers, right? 
""It's too big for me"" but, if you give a time of your day for watch, you will see all the episodes in a little time and, when you do it, you will say: ""fuck, i want more"" 
And that's all fellas, well played...

    I honestly dont know why this anime is so popular lets begin the review lets begin with the story I will say seems really interesting has a lot of potential but the story is about Luffy who wants to be king of the pirates and trys to make that dream come true with his growing crew. next the characters the characters seem very plain to be fair I really did not get to far into this anime the characters seem interesting with a cool back story if i could actual keep watching it which brings me into my next point is the filler/pacing of this show and this is where it so horrible I watch 23 episodes almost nothing really has happen to progress the story and doesn't really cover any back stories. the one thing I really like about this anime is the action and fighting scenes in this anime the sound and art are ok. Overall I really think I would enjoy this anime if there wasn't so many episodes and the pacing wasn't bad people say to read the manga instead it has almost no filler and the pacing is a lot better. I will try the manga out and review but as for the anime it seems to have a lot of potential but to much filler and pacing is god awful.

    This is going to be my first review. I wanted to do a review on One Piece to convince people that they should watch it. This anime will bring you joy and tears. You will be crying of laughter now and then. After you watched this anime you will have a different view on the world. One piece is a lot of comedy but it has a lot of dark and deep moments. 
_________________________________________________________________ 
 
So, before I am going to start this review I have got to say 3 things: 
1. Do not be intimidated by the amount of episodes, at first I was intimidated aswell. But when I started watching the time went by and before I knew it I was already on episode 300.  
 
2. There are some long arcs, the episodes feel slow and you want to stop watching. But, you got to keep watching. Do not skip any episode or you will miss some important details. You can never know what an episode has in store for you before you watch it. You can skip fillers, I recommend not doing so because there are not a lot of fillers in One Piece and most of the fillers are enjoyable.  
 
3. Stay away from the 4kids version. Do not go near it. 
 
_________________________________________________________________ 
I will try to avoid as many spoilers as possible in this review. Aight, I will type this review in 6 categories. Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment, Overall. I will start with Story. 
 
[10] Story: 
 
So, the reason I gave the story a 10 is because it is unique. Let me explain it a bit more detailed. As you may have seen on YouTube or on other social media platforms, there are a lot of theories on One Piece. The reason is because One Piece is such a big world with so much questions. Oda is really good in making the watcher wonder and think about the story.  
 
The story is about a boy named Monkey D. Luffy who wants to become King of the Pirates. Well, that sounds pretty cliche. That maybe true but you get my point after you watch it for yourself. Luffy's goal is different in it's own way. Let me give you an exampe, Naruto wants to become Hokage. That is that he becomes Hokage and than he is the Hokage. We already know what will happen. But for being the Pirate King we do not know anything. 
 
This was what I was talking about earlier. What is the One Piece? What is the secret behind the World Goverment? What is the ''Pirate King''. What is D.? What Devil Fruit has this (Character) So many questions but no answers.  
 
The serie is going for almost 20 years and a lot has been explained but the further we get into the story the more questions. We still do not know shit. After every arc we get another view on the world of One Piece and the characters. This is the reason I love One Piece so much. The mysteries, the hype, the characters, the deep scenes, the agony, the joy. Everything about it. 
 
The backstory's and flashbacks are amazing aswell. You are really curious about the past of most characters. The bounty system is amazing aswell! You are really happy when the character you like gets a new bounty. 
 
I do not really think there is any more to say. You really need to see for yourself without me spoiling anything.  
 
[9] Art: 
 
The art is really unique, this is one of the reasons I love One Piece so much. The characters and scenery is amazing. Most people who just start One Piece were not sure about the art including myself. But after a while you will get used to it. 
 
I myself love drawing One Piece characters. There is something appealing about the style it is hard to explain. It is just your taste who decides if you like it or not. 
 
[10] Sound: 
 
The soundtracks are amazing! The voice acting is supreme. So much emotion behind the voices. When the characters are sad you can feel and hear it trough there voices. 
 
The openings are really good too. My favourites are Opening 1 We are, Opening 13 One day, Opening 15 We Go, Opening 19 We can. This does not mean I do not have the other openings in my playlist because they are amazing as well and give you this adventerous and happy feeling. 
 
About the background soundtracks and characters themes, well they are amazing espacially Luffy's theme. It starts as a happy tune but it ends really dark. This says a lot about Luffy's personality. The other crewmembers have amazing theme songs as well. The background soundtracks are amazing aswell, the background music makes it more emotional or more exciting.  
 
[9] Character: 
 
Characters well I would give it a 10 if there were'nt so much annoying chacters. Not only enemies but some friends of the straw hats are just irritating. But, this does not change the fact that 90% of the characters are amazing and interesting and unique in there own way. 
 
So much characters are introduced in the story and Oda can still think of more intersting Characters with different abilities and personalities. Amazing! 
 
Well, the character development is amazing! I have never seen better character development in another anime than One Piece. I will explain later on why. 
 
As you can tell by my profile picture is Monkey D. Luffy Aka. Mugiwara no Luffy my favourite character. But besides Luffy I have got atleast 20 characters I love. 
As I said earlier the backstory's of the straw hats are really interesting and emotional. Not ony the backstory's of the straw hats but there are a lot of characters with amazing backstory's. 
 
The amazing thing about One Piece is Luffy recruiting new members for the Straw Hat pirates. It is really amazing and you are curious about who joins next. Again, this is something you need to experience yourself and I can not really tell much about this without spoiling anything. 
 
I really want to write more detailed about the main characters. But I do not want to ruin the story for you a spoil stuff about the characters. The reason for not writing any name besides Luffy's is because I want to keep it a secret for the people who do not know who will join the Straw Hats in the future.  
 
Even though you probably seen it on covers or images or on My Anime List under the secton ''Characters''. 
 
[10] Enjoyment: 
 
If you read my review you would have probably seen that I love One Piece and that I enjoyed every bit of it. I actually binged the serie and movies in a really short time.  
 
I love the myserie, the happy moments, the sad moments, the exciting moments and everything besides that. This anime brought me so much tears to my eyes. Not only because of laughter but because of sadness and excitement aswell. 
 
[10] Overall: 
 
There is not really much more to say. I hope I convinced you to try watching One Piece for yourself. I have seen a lot of Shonen anime as you can see on my profile, but One Piece remains number one for me. I think I am going to end this review here. 
_________________________________________________________________ 
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this, I really did my best to avoid spoilers. One Piece is an anime that is hard to explain and you really need to experience it for yourself as I said earlier.  
 
I am sorry if I made some mistakes in grammer and spelling. English is not my first language but I am trying my best.

    SPOILER ALERT 
This is my first review, but let me say this first. This is my personal favorite anime of all times and I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a fun time filled with adventures, action, fantasy and comedy! 
 
Story: 10/10. The story is about Monkey D. Luffy who sets of into the pirat world to look for the one piece. The one piece is a treasure that contains everything that Gold D. Roger (a.k.a. The First And Only Pirat King) left behind after his death. To start of Luffy begins to gather people in his pirat crew: Straw Hat Pirates to set of in the Grand Line where adventures and challenges awaites them at every turn. His goal is to get nakamas in his crew and become the Pirat King.  
 
Art: 9/10. Although the art may not seem good at first, it really fits the story and characters to the show. Remember that this anime started in 1999 and ofcourse the art changes over time and becomes different. Weather you like it or not. Peronaly I think the art is just fine and they should change it the way they want it to. Because I belive the producers know what is best for the show, as we have seen in all the episode so far. (damn good and I can't complain).  
 
Sound: 10/10. The sound in this Anime has to be one of the best things about the series. Every sound fits perfectly and you really can't seem to find any bad fits for it. The music is also great where they have over 60 songs. The voice actors for the characters fits amazingly and I feel like that is how the character would sound in the real world. The sounds is definitely one of the things that does this anime to the best one so far. 
 
Characters: 9/10. The main thing about the characters is that it is really important to separate characters the second you lay eyes on them. Therefore I think the special designs on some of the characters is good and should be like that. For example Usopp with his long nose. Each character has their own uniqe element to their characters so that we can both see their personality and their characters. The main thing about the way one piece does this story is that the focuse on each individual which takes a huge amount of episodes and time. Which is not a bad thing btw. We can really feel the characters and get to know them. One example of this was when they were getting rid of the Going Merry, Usopp was devastated. We knew that because the boat was a gift from Kaya and Usopp had a special relationship with the Going Merry. All in all, love the characters.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10. This anime is perfect to watch if you just want to relax and have a good time watching Luffy beat up everyone. There is not much to say other than when you start watching the show, you can't stop untill you have watched every episode and movie of the series. I think I completed all 800+ episodes in under a month where I could not do anything else than watch this amazing anime. 
 
Overall: 10/10. This anime is my favorite anime and I can't wait for each new episode that comes out. And I want the anime to continue well past 1000 episodes so that I can watch it long into the future. I recommend this so much to everyone who loves a good adventure, action and fantasy anime with some good laugh in the as well.

    A MASTERPIECE.  
 
The plot, the characters, the action scenes, the concept, even the fillers are nice!!! I love how vast its world is and almost all types of people, powers and places are here! It  
 
It will never fail to make you laugh and cry. Unlike other Shonen animes that solves the problem by mere willpower and guts, this one's different. Lots of unexpected twists and revelations. It doesn't focus only on a one character instead its the whole crew of the Straw Hat Pirates. Every one of them gets to grab the spotlight but of course Luffy is still the has the max airtime. 
 
I guess its only flaw is that it is a BIT long but despite the number of its episodes it is definitely worth watching. I will see this anime til the end no matter how long it takes. Kudos to Oda!

    ""What? You still haven't seen One Piece?"" 
 
That's the response I always get when meeting fellow anime fans once they ask me about One Piece. And then after that, they'd proceed and tell me reasons why I should watch it now.  
 
I know that it's good. I heard a lot of positive reviews about it after all. But what discouraged me from picking it up (which I'm sure might also the reason those who still haven't seen One Piece have no plans to do so) is the number of episodes. It's A LOT and unless you're really dedicated and patient, that won't sit well with you.  
 
Well, guess what? The reason why I didn't want to watch it in the first place became the main reason why I love it. I'm so glad I didn't let it discourage me from trying it out! 
 
And so, after three months and one week of marathoning this anime, I finally caught up with the latest episode when this review was written which was episode 831. Wow, what a ride. One Piece has everything I love about anime--enthralling world, captivating plot, mind-blowing twists, fascinating and relatable characters, heart-stopping actions, heartbreaking deaths, and more. That's why in no time, One Piece became one of my most favorite anime of all time. 
 
Thanks to the huge number of episodes, you can really get attached to the SH crew and other notable characters to the point where you can't imagine life without them. From the first episode, I immediately knew my life was about to change now that I discovered this treasure. 
 
The world it offers is really beautiful. The parallels that are compared to real life are just simply brilliant.  
 
Don't even get me started with the plot. This plus the plot twists are strengths of One Piece. Every arc will surely get you hooked and after watching an episode, it'll make you want for more.  
 
Great characters too. The backstories are relatable and you can really sympathize with them. You'll get attached to them that's why the deaths are really heartbreaking. There was a character's death where it took me three weeks before I had the strength to continue watching the series! That's how in love I am with this anime and not everyone can do that so good job Oda! 
 
The actions are great too. There are times when I felt like my heart would stop in suspense. I just wish they'd shorten it though. There were a lot of times where I skipped some scenes because it felt like the animators were just dragging it (which is probably the real case).  
 
As for the soundtracks, well it's good but most of the opening and ending songs are forgettable for me. It's not enough to catch my attention and convince me not to skip it. However, there are notable opening songs as well that I didn't skip at all.  
 
Overall, One Piece is one of the best anime of all time for me. It deserves all the success and praise it receives! A true classic, indeed. So don't hesitate and just jump right in! You're in for a ride of a lifetime. ;)

    Personally I have tried 4 times to get into this series (reading and watching). Each time something different has been a turn off for me but I know there are a lot of people on the other side of the fence. So I guess give it a try. My big 3 reasons for not liking this series 
 
1.) I am not gonna rag on it to much but like some of the other comments mention the art style is not for everyone, I can't deal with it for very long myself. 
 
2.) The characters. This is somewhat of a nitpick and I have heard now since they are on episode like 800+ and some crazy amount of manga chapters some of this has been remedied but outside of Luffy,Zoro,Nami, and Sanji the other characters for the main cast are flat out annoying.  
 
3.) The length. I understand that for some people this doesn't bother them cause they have been reading since day 1. I don't have 3 lifetimes to spend trying to get caught up with this. If you are someone who has limited time due to life this is not for you if you want to have any idea what is currently going on. While I am not trying to give much away but with all the strange adventures that this series covers I was informed after so many episodes they made it to the grand line where they were trying to go for so long just to sail right back away from it? At this point can't tell if they are just trying to drag it out for every penny its worth or if there is story they couldn't continue in a spin off.

INTRO: 
 
I started One Piece because I noticed it was placed pretty high on the TOP anime list here (#38 at the time). And I was just thinking ""WHY? Looks shitty"". Anyway I felt like trying out another long running series at the time cause I was starting to get real bored with the other big shounens, and perhaps the genre itself. ""WTH I'll give it a go"". 
 
6 years later. I don't regret. ONE PIECE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE!!! 
 
It does not fall short compared to other battle shounens. I guarantee you. Looks kiddy in regards to the art, and the silliness it dishes out often, but it's no way a show just for kids like pokemon or Yu-gi-oh. Aight?  
 
 
STORY: 
 
Our main cast are pirates! They're actually the supposed bad guys here. They are not do-gooders. They just do whatever the hell they want, and sometimes that includes helping people, and kicking the other evil guys' butt. Their enemies and conflicts will arise from other pirates, the marines, and the world Government.  
 
The core element is adventure. It's adventure-plot driven. It's starts off with them island hopping, getting entangled in new stories, cultures, kicking the bad guy's ass, but the island hopping isn't all that random. They pertain to the main overarching plot, and to get to the final destination, well they gotta go to some places. In each arc, you'll obtain some piece of information that is relevant to the main story. The further you go in, you'll notice it becomes more and more connected to the overall arching plot.  
 
I wanna talk a little bit about the world of One Piece. In terms of world building, OP does more of it and better than most. ODA gave himself lots of leg room to work with yo. OP has this 'don't take me too seriously vibe' which helps us not to criticize it too much for some of the weirder things, yet it still manages to make it quite believable. A few minor things might not make sense, but overall it works. 
 
The plot is more complex than what it appears. The plot will grow, conflicts will arise, so many many awesome people you will meet, and even see again. Oda does a great job at seeding things in early on and tying them together later. And there are still many intriguing mysteries that are still yet to be solved even after 700 episodes. The world of One Piece is big, but the best thing is that it all feels connected.  
 
 
 
ART:  
 
Old, weird, fugly art at the beginning. Overtime style evolves a bit, and looks a lot better. I've come to personally love the style, especially the manga art. Gotta let it grow on you. Animation is acceptable-ish overall, later on before time skip it seems to get pretty good! Then after time skip it kinda goes to shit again. 
 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
This is the place where OP shines.  
 
THE CHARACTERS MAN. MANY ARE UNIQUE (some more than others), WEIRD, QUIRKY, BADASS, AND JUST PLAIN AWESOME. The characters are really something. I end up liking a lot of them, even ones where I initially thought wouldn't amount to anything worthy of attention. Oda gives his little imaginary people, character that you just can't help but end up liking despite how utterly bizarre they look sometimes. And in this grand OP world, you are going to be running into many different people. The OP cast is huge, some are one-dimensional, but many leave an impression on you.  
 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
PROS: Before I knew it, I end up loving the characters and their interactions with one another. Strong feels. I laugh, shed some manly tears, can really feel the anger of the characters. This show makes me feel lots during their adventures, but mostly this show puts a smile on my face. Good mix of comedy and serious business. Some of my favorite moments are just when the crew's hanging out on their ship, relaxing. Not a lot of fillers compared to other shounens either, and even when there are fillers, it's short, there for comedy sake, and fun to watch. I think the story & writing is really good, not cliche, and keeps me hooked. Unpredictable often, and I'm just sitting back and enjoying the ride.  
 
CONS: Might be a rough start for some, slow-paced as fuck at times/drawn out scenes in order to not catch up to the manga, seldom boring ass fodder villains (mostly during the start), excessive booby fan-service recently, can get repetitive, post time skip is starting to feel like your typical boring shounen. There are so many episodes, so of course there will be some boring ones. 
 
 
OVERALL:  
 
After all that praising, there will still be people who won't like it at all. It's because we're all fucking different and value different things.  
 
There are those who ONLY like watching mature, seinen, deep, intellectual, realistic animes who will find One Piece childish, and just not their thing.  
Then there are those who are more flexible and can enjoy the above listed and all kinds of other animes, and can appreciate humor, etc etc, AND WOULD STILL assume One Piece to be a trashy children's show just based on first impressions. 
 
I'm here to help the latter group of people, (who are able to enjoy a wide variety of anime like cowboy bebop, FMA, DBZ, Naruto, etc all at the same time) to understand that One Piece isn't as childish/retarded as they might initially think, and that they might enjoy it. 
 
It's not a kiddy or lame as Pokemon, Yugioh (no hate for these guys btw). One piece has comedy, but also has a serious story, and based on the numbers/facts, many do indeed, find it interesting. So give it a chance if you are on the fence about it. DROP IT if you absolutely HATE the first 150 episodes, BUT STILL BE AWARE that the story does get better and deeper the further you go in. (Isn't it like that for all big shounens?) 
 
It's not perfect. Why is it so popular then? Because it's just so damn enjoyable to watch despite some of its' flaws. For whatever reason, it clicked in the right way for a lot of us, and we just can't get enough of it. To be able to enjoy and be entertained. Isn't that all we want from a show? 
 
Another thing. I don't know about you guys, but OP feels more badass and less corny(?) to me than most of the other battle shounens. Can't explain it too well. 
 
 
TL;DR // RECOMMENDED FOR: 
 
So finally, if you love shounen such as DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, bleach, Gintama, HxH, and/or Hitman Reborn, and haven't tried One Piece, please do come see what the fuss is about. There's a good chance you might enjoy One Piece too. OP is sometimes sillier than some of these other titles and some people really don't have tolerance for that, and would prefer darker vibes like HxH, BUT if you're FLEXIBLE (you like all kinds of anime), give it a chance. TRUST ME, OP DOES NOT FALL SHORT IN TERMS OF STORY & SERIOUSNESS. Please, don't judge a book by its' cover. It is my favorite of the long battle shounens, and the only one of its' kind to have kept me interested this long. This is coming from someone who isn't a big fan of long battle shounens in the first place. 
 
If I were to grade the anime a little more fairly, I would give it a 7 or 8 because sometimes the animation quality drops, and also sometimes Toei adds useless scenes, or drags out certain boring scenes, and there are those boring episodes with boring badguys once in awhile. And also some little plot flaws like how a character never dies, etc. But if I were to grade it based on how much I fucking enjoy One Piece, it's story and characters overall, I give it a 10. 
 
So overall, anime One Piece gets 9/10 from me. 
 
 
 
Advice:  
 
For the love of God, don't go skipping around arcs. You're not gonna get that build up feel, and connection to the characters, which is important here. If you're gonna dedicate yourself to understanding OP, if you wanna understand why the fans love OP, it's best to watch all the arcs, (minus foxy arc unless you don't mind more comedy). Or better yet, just read the damn manga instead. The manga is perfect, the anime can sometimes be a little horrendous with the dragging and the unnecessary scenes.  And again, if you find the first 100 or so episodes TERRIBLY unbearable, it probably isn't your thing.

    After considering other anime as my favorite I've decided one thing ""one piece"". 
Unlike other animes, you can just watch one piece and it won't stop! 
A big pro about this anime is it's length.  
As long as you have the time, you can watch a lot of it without worrying that it'll end soon. 
Another great thing is the storyline. There isn't one big storyline like other animes,  this comes with arcs, an island with it's History and story, with the little storyline of what happends in the world of one piece. 
I've said to myself ""Okay I'm gonna watch this island again for sure!"" But after seeing the next one which is better ""No way! This is even better!"" And this is how it goes. 
The soundtrack- an awesome one, many themes for many situations. 
One piece started about 15 years ago, when the art was pretty ""bad"" but as the episodes pass the art is getting better. 
For those who watched Naruto and those with fillers, One Piece doesn't have many fillers and most of it are flashbacks. 
 
Movies! I've seen some of the sidestory movies which were good as well, like the real One Piece. 
 
Then, ""One Piece"" is THE anime of all times and can be considered a masterpiece.

    PLEASE READ FIRST: I have not yet caught up on One Piece so my review is only for the first 141 episodes. Think of it as a first impression if you want. I'll rewrite my review every 150 episodes or so. Please don't get anal on me if you don't agree with this review, like i said, it's only for the first 141 episodes. I have not written many reviews so constructive criticism is always more than welcome.   
 
Lemme just start off by saying if you have not yet started watching One Piece because you're intimidated by its size i would highly recommend starting it just to get a feel for it. It has definitely earned it's right to popularity. Plus you can always take it slow, there's no need to rush an anime if you don't have the time or ability to rush it. As for me i'm taking it pretty slowly, it took me three weeks to get to episode 141 and i've been taking a break from it for the past month but i will start watching again soon.  
 
Story 8/10 
One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy who is a some what dumb witty pirate on a quest to find the greatest treasure in the world, the One Piece, and become the Pirate King. You get to watch how Luffy gathers his own crew (nakama), gets his own ship and fight for nakama power. That pretty much sums up the amount of story i've seen so far. I gave the story an 8/10 because i did feel that it was very good and it gives the anime huge possibilities. Especially since this is a long time running shounen, the amount of arcs and character development they can do is almost endless. Thankfully there actually has been a decent amount of character development. I really can't wait to catch up to the series and honestly i've always loved pirates as a kid so when i heard there was an anime about pirates that was over 600 episodes i was like ""oh hell yea!!""  Only reason i took a break was because the pacing of the anime was just too god damn slow. Like the fight between luffy and Mr. 3 in the alabasta pre arc... omg no. too slow so no thx you. This is my main problem i have for the story, Oda Eiichiro is a genius but his pacing can be almost unbearable at times. My second problem is all the arcs so far have been extremely predictable. It basically goes like this; Luffy and his crew would go fight the bad guy and the bad guy's crew, they would beat up all the unimportant grunts of the crew and then there would be a few enemies that were actual threats and they would have to fight  with Luffy's crew. Then when it was time to fight the main bad guy, everyone would wait for Luffy to come and kick his ass. That pretty much explains every arc so far. :/ 
 
Art and Sound 8/8 
The art was pretty good for being as old as it was, i can't really complain to much because as One Piece progresses you'll begin to notice the art also progresses with the series. Nothing too impressive yet but i'm sure as i catch up i'll start to see the higher quality of the art and animation. The sound was pretty good, not too many memorable songs so far but there are one or two in there. That does not mean they don't have good songs! One Piece has songs that fit the situations they're placed in but unlike Fairy Tail or Magi the sound track doesn't really stick to me.  
 
Character 10/10 
Yes, 10/10 for the characters, Luffy is hilarious, he's honest and even though he's some what dumb, he has a true love for his nakama. Most people don't like nakama power in anime but i for one love nakama power, if it's a shounen and it doesn't have nakama power than it just doesn't feel right when i watch it. Obviously that's just my opinion, i know a lot of people hate nakama power with the passion but as a kid till now i've always believed in the powers of nakama. I like Zoro's character too because he's a total bad ass. He has three swords and he tears up every body with them. Nami is cool because even though sh'es useless in a fight, she's useful in like everything else from navigating to operating the ship. Usopp can go to hell. Chopper is amazing and i actually haven't got to the character development for nico robin yet so i really don't know too much about her so i can't say anything about her yet. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 
I really really enjoyed this anime. It's funny and has a good feel to it when i watch it. It has a lot of nakama power and a good amount of action in it. The situations The Straw Hat Pirates find themselves in are hilarious. If only it wasn't for the pacing of this anime i would have rated it a 10 for my enjoyment. Cause honestly i can tolerate the predictability of the anime but slow pacing is a no go! Especially for longer series.  
 
Overall 8/10 
This is an anime that should definitely be watched by everyone. For the most part it's very good, the story is very original, and like i said before Oda is a genius. One Piece has a snowballing effect  so the more you go the more it builds up and it will eventually turn to this giant masterpiece of snow and amazement.. that is very predictable with terrible pacing haha. No seriously though, i'm glad i started it.

    When it comes to One Piece, there are two kinds of people. The first ones, obviously, are the people who hate the guts of this anime. Second ones are who love it to the core. There's virtually nothing in between. 
Let me tell you. For the ones who watch the first few episodes and go on telling stories like ""Oh it's not even worth it. I watched 5 episodes and I'm done"". You missed out on an amazing journey. It's like the saying ""Never judge a book by its cover"" (Even when the book has 800+ chapters!). The first few episodes can only be expressed as part of the cover. Shit gets real once you get a hang of the later episodes, like during Arlong Park Arc. After that, you're put on an amazing journey, with lots of enjoyment, character development, feels and much more. And if you ask me, One Piece actually has one  of the best character development plots I've seen. I do admit though, scrolling through some other reviews, I saw the criticism on how almost all characters never really die, no matter how hard they get hit. I do agree with that. But at the same time, this element isn't of too much importance if you ask me ._. 
So for those of you who give One Piece a bad review at first sight, I advice you. Give it a try, and you'll love it. You heard it from me.

    Soooo um this is my first review and just to get this out of the way I don't hate One Piece it just wasn't my cup of tea so I dropped it I might go back to it though and if I do I'll review it again 
 
I watched this anime Dubbed (The   
 FUNimation Dub not the 4Kids one by the way) 
 
Story - 7 
Ok the story is that the character Luffy wants to find a legendary treasure known as the ""One Piece"" and become the Pirate King only theirs one problem he doesn't have a ship or a crew or any idea what he's doing ok so maybe theirs a few problems 
I see know problem with this story only it takes a long while to get going which makes sense when you hear from fans that it takes 30 episodes to get off the ground which in my opinion is not a good thing to me an anime should get 
you hooked on first epiosde or maybe the first few but not 30 thats just not right so One Piece does not have a bad story it just has a really REALLY slow (At the begenning at lesat) one which makes it kinda boring to me just saying 
 
Art - 8 
The art is good I guess I never care about the art or animation so lets move on 
 
Sound - 8 
I guess the sound is good I don't really get why I have to talk about sound so again lets move on 
 
Charater - 7 
Fainlly something to talk about so the charaters their good I like them I guess I'll talk about each of them well the ones I know about 
 
Luffy - He's this animes MAIN main protagonist of One Piece he's well he's werid but not in a bad way he's goofy and funny but can be really serious when mad 
he's a good charater in my book 
 
Zoro - He's cool and intersting I like the fact that he has 3 swords he's got a sad backstory that I won't spoil 
so yeah 
 
Nami - She's clever and funny and she also has a sad backstory which I can't spoil becase I don't know what it is 
 
Usopp - He's funny and a lair he's also is a cowrd but brave when tries he's backstory is sad too and again I won't spoil it 
 
I'd make one on Sanji but I know almost nothing about him so moveing on 
 
Enjoyment - 7 
I had a good time watching it but like I said with the story it was knida boring from what I watched 
still it made me laugh from time to time but it also made me sit a my screen for a few mintes doing nothing deosn't mean it didn't make happy or sad it did I promiose it was just like I said kinda boring 
 
Overall - 6 
To me One Piece has its ups and downs its ups being its humor the charaters and the fights its downs are that the beginning is slow and takes to many episodes to get off the ground 
Maybe your opinion will be diffrent when you watch it well if you watch it sorry if this review was lacking it is my first one after all I also didn't watch much of One Piece so I don't have much to go off of

    This is the first review I have ever written, or even plan to write, so give me a break. 
 
 To sum up ""One Piece"" in a single word, I would have to say AMAZING. Everything about it represents why I love watching anime. The fact that I am still watching it now after 550 episodes, and still wanting more is enough to show just how great it is. The only negative aspect about the show is also a good thing. There a simply a TON of episodes. In order to start one piece you need to be willing to dedicate days of time towards it. But if you love One Piece, like I do, then the fact that there are so many episodes is actually the best part about it! 
  
Im not the type of person to go in depth about things, so I will keep this brief. One Piece offers a simple, yet genius story. Has an amazing cast of characters. Has a variety of different elements, including comedy, action, adventures, tear-jerking scenes, and even a little romance. AND WHO DOESN""T LOVE PIRATES? COME ON! Combine all these things and then some, and you get my favorite anime of all time. For those of you who are willing to spend a lot of time on an anime, WATCH ONE PIECE! You wont regret it.

    Lets start with One Piece is a long show. it took me half a year to arrive to ep 600 and even then not the latest ep. ( I watch it during most weekend and holidays) You might feel discourage so if you do i suggest you watch a small spoiler. Since thats 1 of the other reason i did not drop the anime. 
 
When i first watch the first episode i showed no interest in this anime. Half way through the first ep i fell asleep . It took me another year or 2 before i start getting serious and began watching One Piece. 
 
The animation before the time slip or whatever it call was not into my liking. But after getting use to it i began to really love one piece. Luffy and his crew is a hilarious bunch that i love to hang out with. There will be a hot character appearing randomly and sometimes an ugly one . Occasionally the animation will show unnecessary and unwanted episode  disrupting the show. 
 
One piece however is a loyal anime. A character that appear during the first few episode might appear at episode 300+.  So i hope if you are planning to watch this you have to remember the sort of i-dont-think-i-see-this-character-again character. If not you might be lost. 
 
The fun part of One piece is when you reach 300+ episode. Thats where you could see the plot moving into a different direction. So wait until you reach that episode before thinking badly of the animation.  
 
Reaching the 400+ you might have already experience sadness and laughter is you did not then you are inhuman. (I cried continuously for episodes). Im sure around this chapter there will be a hangover. A random episode will appear at the crucial part. I would have skip it if i havent had that this-episode-might-not-be-important feeling. 
 
The skip year happened. (yesh) better animation. Better looks. tearful meeting. and LAW!! He is my sexy bitch. The appearance of LAW, Makes the animation more hilarious than it already is. Well this is as far as i already watch. 
 
WATCH IT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. IF YOU THINK ITS BORING . JUDGE IT AFTER WATCHING EP 300+. YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DONT, THERE ARE MANY TIMES I'LL FEEL LIKE SQUEEZING MY HEART. SO WATCH IT.

    This review can contain spolliers(I'll try my best to not to give any) and spelling mistakes(My native language isn't english). 
 
I've dropped this anime 3 times in its beginning, and today it's one of my favorites, so I decided to do this review so people can have patience and take advantage of this great work. 
 
 
 
Let's started with the story (10/10) - The story it's simple by the began, but having the novelty of the main character isn't but the traditional hero always, telling the story of an outlaw pirate(Luffy) and the pursuit of his dream of becoming the king of pirates. 
In this anime Luffy has a goal, different from many other anime, several times you will hear the main character scream '' I'm gonna become King Of the Pirates'' like Naruto scream ''I will become Hokage''. This is not something negative since with a goal already in mind the anime doesn't create much content that hasn't connection with the main objective, this making the anime more ''fast'', I just remember of 4 episodes fillers in +700. 
But of course nothing is perfect and certain episodes try to delay the story a lot, especially in the saga Dressrosa, in which there are many repeated scenes, such as scenes where people show often running in the same episode. 
This anime takes a while to get interesting, to get an idea I dropped it about 3 times at its beginning, where the fights can't get my attention and I was surprising very the different traits, mainly in the eyes of the characters. It took me until episode 70 to start really taking advantage of.  
But after that Eiichiro Oda manages to create a whole new world(literally, lol), with a very well made plot and organizations that have their secrets or their particular goals and all this can have connection with the main characters, becoming more and more an unforeseeable anime. 
 
Art (9/10)  - As I had said, the art and ''lines, dashes'' of the characters is very different from ordinary. At first I thought it was horrible, but I easily got used to it and many of the characters I consider to be one of the most creative and beautiful to see. 
But it really took me a while to get used to Usopp, being one of the most different characters in appearance. And to think that today he is considered ''God Usoop''... (not spolier, I swear). 
It is also good to say that throughout the anime the art improves a lot in all aspects, only I not liking the change in Robin. 
 
Sound (10/10) - Great music, especially in action scenes. My favorite is ''The very, very, very strongest''. I don't know much what to comment more here, so let's go to the next one. 
 
Character (10/10) - All characters are unique, both in design and in personality. Luffy looks a bit ''baka'' too much, but that makes it all very funny, and when he gets angry the only thing you think is: ''woohaaa Luffy will get him''. 
My favorite one is Zoro, he's the best... He's like Vegeta but even better... lol, but it's truth. 
This anime hasn't only 1 main, throughout the story more and more characters are highlighting and catching our attention, but of course that focuses more on Luffy...  
Also has a great prominence for main characters, several times you will get totally annoyed with them. Even villains who don't possess grandiose powers are able to make us angry with their very exentric personalities. 
There are so many great characters in this anime that if I were to quote everyone I would write for 3 days and I could tell spoliers unintentionally 
, so I'll just say that and go to the next one. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10) - You will enjoy every moment watching this anime, but it's important to have patience especially at the beginning of it, but it will be worth every second that you spend watching.  
Honestly I delayed to start this anime because of the large number of episodes that it has, but before long I watched so many episodes that I easily reached the current episodes and still hoping that this incredible anime takes a long time to finish. 
 
Overall (10/10) - This anime is incredible, is it Master Piece in all aspects, mainly in story... So the only thing I say to you that has read all this review is: please be patient with the beginning of the anime that in the end you will be inspired by this great work of Eiichiro Oda.

    Great anime to watch if you have nothing to do. Sure it's long and it's still ongoing, but don't be hesitated to watch. The story is great, everything is great. The only problem is time. I caught up with the anime in 2 years and I'm waiting for new episodes to come out. In terms of action, it is also good like Naruto.  
 
After you have finished the Skypea arc, trust me, the real story will begin. It will lead them to a new threat, THE WORLD! It will have our heroes a hard time in overcoming this threat until today.  
 
Read the manga if you caught up to the episodes. The author is a genius for giving us this anime and manga.

    This review will be undeniably biased! ""I believe that no matter how old we grow and mature we get, we will always have that child inside us"" and ONE PIECE is the that woke mine.  Of course, just like other anime, this one is probably not for everyone as we have our own different taste of genre. This anime requires time and commitment to be able to understand the whole story. 
 
First with the brilliant Author, I myself is a huge fan of Fairy Tail (Mashima Hiro)  and Naruto (Kishimoto Masashi) they are my top three! but I still believe that Eiichiro Oda is the best among all of them because until now I can't still figure out how he does such amazing plot twist throughout the story and the fact that the ENDING has already been laid out and so much has already happened yet the ending remains unchanging is just too brilliant.  
 
Second, Toei production! This anime has been following the manga and there has to be a gap between the latest chapter and episode. Therefore, the time comes when one anime has to make a filler but when one piece has to make one they are still able to connect it with the flow of the series and that's what makes them amazing. The first episode has an old animation since technology has not been developed at that time but now they create this amazing design and animation.  
 
Thrid, Characters 9 members! namely, LUFFY, ZORO, NAMI, USOPP, SANJI, CHOPPER, ROBIN, FRANKY, and BROOK! these nine characters are the one that brings joy in the series the bond and loyalty of these people are truly remarkable. All of them have gone through painful childhood and LUFFY the captain of the crew has made a huge impact in their life and made them capable of changing to reach their individual dreams. Luffy's faith to the crew is one of the most amazing things for me, ""betrayal"" may come but he himself  (instinct basically) knows that there is a reason why one member can act that way and of course he is right. Every saga introduced a new character and all of them comes with a sad story which touches the viewer's life and can truly bring you learnings! 
 
 
Fourth, STORY! as I said ODA truthfully is one brilliant mangaka/author. The whole series is full of plot twists and emotions. as I mentioned every saga and arc introduce a new character and all of them comes with a shocking plot twist. There will be times when something is mentioned in the beginning of the episode but we will only get the explanation in the middle of the story.  
OVERALL THERE'S SO MUCH PLOT TWISTS AND EXPLANATION ODA NEEDS TO LAY OUT TO HIS READERS! SO MUCH ENJOYMENT, EXCITEMENT, AND THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO! A NEVER BORING ANIME! 
 
This anime is a roller coaster and of course, this is beyond 10 for me in comes of ratings! I recommend this manga/anime to people who can truly commit and can give time since it has currently 867 chapters and 791 episodes (I am following both manga and anime)!

    ""The beautiful depth of the story itself compensates for the drag of this anime..."" 
 
okay Im not going to write a review on every little aspect and detail. Rather I do want to highlight the negative side of this anime because there is only few that bugs me. If dealt with then I believe it could be the most amazing anime of all time.  
 
My biggest pet peeves with this anime are mainly two things.  
1) the DRAG. Seriously the last anime that I thought was a drag was Dragonball Z. Seriously One Piece takes 1/4 of your entire episode on the starting theme song and the ""previously on One Piece"". THus I always fast forward to the 4-5mn mark to start watching. Also they spend another good 1/4 of the anime on slow walking characters, slow reactions, to slow opening doors, to replayed movements. Its hilariously dragged out.  
HOWEVER i get it! they are pumping out episodes non stop since 1999 on top of movie specials, and special eps. I get it, its probably how the people in the studio cope with it. But still, it drives me insane. THats why I always binge watch One Piece. Once a year during Christmas holidays I watch around 50 episodes. BUT F*CK ME! even with a year worth of episodes its only like 1 week into the actual story line.  
 
2) Another pet peeve is the character of Luffy. YEs you heard me, the main character, the indestructible, loved by all, Monkey f*cking D Luffy. Dont get me wrong, do i like the character? absolutely. But he pisses me off because of his character and personality. YEs at first i enjoyed his irrational, free spirited, careless fearless personality, but that goes into some extent. With every crisis that arrises because of Luffys immaturity alot of ppl suffer. But ofcourse its an anime so it all works out in the end, so i dont mind it. However what I do mind is the fact that he just doesnt grow up nor learn from his mistakes. Hes the same luffy from ep 1. Sure he learnt new skills, and broaden his boundaries. But his major maturity level, of dealing with situation hasnt changed. If he knows his rash decisions or irrational behaviours have caused many people to stumble then like any other human being he should be able to learn from it. Thus I find him selfish in that sense. But the irony is he is portrayed as the most selfless character who is willing to die for his friends, which is the cause of his vast popularity. But my major argument is simply, hes selfish in the sense of not having the self control in his lack of maturity. like any other decent human they should be able to grow and mature. But I think he hasnt. But I understand without this side of him the anime wouldnt be as adventurist as it is, which we all known to love.   
 
Overall its still an amazing anime, but this is just my honest opinion.

    Ok guys I'm gonna make this short, One Piece is the best that's it! I watch it for the Epicness and badassery unlike most anime and manga One Piece relates to the outer world as you have an evil World Government trying to tarnish and control people's ideals and actions with discrimination and brutality, so relate this to the outer world and what do you get? 
 
Another reason are the AWESOME characters like Shanks, Monkey D Dragon, Sabo, Akainu, Kizaru, Aokiji, Ace, Whitebeard, Dracule Mihawk, Kaidou, Big Mom etc. All which have their own unique personalities and ones we haven't seen yet  
( Don't get close to Shanks, he's got Conqueriors Haki and you might die from epicness! ). To be honest I watch it for the fights and the characters so...... yeah... and once people who want to get into One Piece but when they see the number of episodes find it impossible so I tell them its worth the effort!. Get into it, One Piece By far has one of the best STORYLINES IN ALL OF ANIME!.  
 
Hope you find this review helpful, Have a good day

    You can't Really fully Appreciate one piece without a decent Brain and Vast General knowledge.  
 
Kids will like the adventures, ""chase your dream"" motto, friends and all the action. 
 
But it takes a Teen and older to Truly Pick up on the Deeper Plot meanings and underlying point in the storyline.  
 
One piece touches on modern day problems such as racism, corruption, abuse of power, information manipulation, history cover-up, Slavery, Drug addiction and terrorists. 
 
Racism: Evident with the Fishmen and human relationship where humans which regard Fishmen as nothing more than Beasts capture and sold Fishmen off as slaves causing Hatred among fishmen towards humans. 
 
Corruption, where some Navy soliders deal with the black market and sells items off to criminals and pirates. 
 
Abuse of Power, Certain Navy personal can destroy islands if they feel like it without any valid reasons, Tenryubito can summon Admirals when they feel like it and capture/kill/maim anyone they deem fit. 
 
information manipulation: When the Navy covered up crocodile's Defeat to SHs by crediting it to smoker and of course the hidden secret of Ace's bloodline, Garp's Bloodline, Robin's Past and of course the burning of books regarding the poneglyphs. 
 
history cover-up: of course the banning of anyone learning to read poneglyphs, burning of books regarding poneglyphs, destruction of any material regarding the blank century and of course hunting and killing anyone who knows anything and implementing the vague story of how kings of many countries came together and created the World government. 
 
Slavery:  Tenryubitos or any other people in the one piece world can buy slaves, the world government has been using slaves to build a useless world bridge to link the world in tortuous conditions without any regard to the human rights and tenryubitos torture and ""play"" with their slaves. 
 
Drug Addiction: Fishmen Island ARC Had hordy jones and his new fishmen pirates eating tons of steroids and many people can argue that chopper does steroids too but chopper is a doctor he knows what he's doing. And seeing how this is a review for the Anime I shall not include anything from the manga. but trust me drug addiction is a thing in one piece Sheshesheshesh   
 
Terrorists: Actually it really depends on what you define is a terrorist, if you define a terrorist as someone/some group which attacks a country not representing any other country then every pirate that attacks any island is a terrorist but what if the country being attacked is a bad country does that make the terrorist a good guy/group?  
 
And that's why even though one piece is so long, it remains interesting, it makes you think about issues that are very relevant to the real world. 
 
of course one Piece also has a interesting world with weird weather, cool technology (COLA = OIL), and Super Natural Stuff such as HAKI, DEVIL Fruits, weird places such as: only every freaking island! 
 
And of course great fight scenes with cool DF powers and awesome soundtracks.

    One Piece is an anime frequently classified with Bleach and Naruto as one of the ""Big 3"" in anime and manga. These 3 have ruled at the top in terms of popularity for over a decade, and their popularity is still high as ever, if not higher. I personally find it really hard to get into long-running animes (+100) but surprisingly, One Piece was an exception, a rare one at that.  
 
One Piece was one of my first anime I've watched. (first being pokemon ofc) It was the anime that got me into anime, especially when there was a time where I thought anime was boring and a waste of time. I literally thought that they didn't have anything special about it. However, after getting a recommendation from my brother, One Piece really changed my views on anime. Since I barely knew about anime at that time, I was really intrigued by the aspect of pirates and adventure. I watched one episode, then another, and another... and I was hooked to the show in no time at all. Because I was impressed by One Piece, I started watching other shows, mostly of the similar genre. From then, my love for anime has grew and grew, and is still growing to this day and it's all thanks to one great piece of anime. 
 
One Piece takes place during the Great Age of Pirates, which started when the King of Pirates, Gol D. Roger announced to the world shortly before his death that he had hidden his greatest treasure, the ""One Piece"" somewhere, and told others to find it. About 20 years later, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy, who ate the Gomu Gomu no mi devil fruit, also interested in finding the One Piece and exploring the world, sets out on a journey full of exciting adventures, dangerous pirates and marines, and meeting new friends. From there, he makes many new comrades to support his journey. 
 
The story itself seems nothing special, but it evolves as the time goes on. At the time of writing this review, One Piece is at 670 episodes, which might tell you that it is rather drawn out. However, during those 670 episodes, they slowly build the world and characters into something unique and huge, enhancing the story bit by bit. The story arcs are fantastic and well thought out, sometimes leaving you in awe. In the story arcs, you are usually introduced to other minor characters, some who are equally interesting to watch just as the main characters. And the fights as a whole, are really well paced and entertaining, mixing blends of action, humor, and drama to keep you hooked. 
Also, like most other long running anime, One Piece does have its share of fillers. BUT, they have nowhere near an overwhelming amount of fillers and some fillers can even be enjoyable as well. The fillers also introduce you to new characters, who although non-canon, are still pretty likable as well.  
 
Like many other animes, One Piece also has a system of supernatural powers. In the world of One Piece, there are things known as Devil Fruits, which essentially take the shape of real-life fruits, but taste horrible and give consumers a unique power. Depending on the user and how they use it, the Devil Fruit can become something very powerful. The concept of the Devil Fruit is one of the most impressive aspects of One Piece. There are three types of known Devil Fruit: Paramecia, which gives you the ability of superhuman ability or traits, Zoan which lets you transform into an animal, and finally Logia, which can transform your body into an element like fire or ice.  
 The idea of eating something and getting superpowers is nothing new, but the fact that One Piece has shown an immense amount of Devil Fruits already, and that no two fruits are ever the same, is quite impressive. Oda really exercised his creativity level on this part, as while some abilities might come off as goofy, you cannot deny the creativity and work Oda put into some of the fruits and their users. 
 
For the Art... now this is the section I've heard the MOST complaints about. To be honest, I was bit skeptical myself when I first saw the art style. It can come off as cartoonish, childish drawing for the most parts, possibly turning off viewers. However, as I watched on and on, I forgot about it. After a couple of episodes, I honestly didn't CARE for how the art looked, as I was just immensely enjoying the hell out of the show. It's really a hit or miss however, as it can turn many people off completely, while others might not be bothered by it so much. 
Also, nowadays, the art in One Piece has improved dramatically. It is much more pleasing to the eye than it ever was. The artwork is fresh and clean. The character designs are also outstanding as well. Some might be drawn rather silly, but the uniqueness in some of the character art is very fun to look at. 
 
Now, I've heard some people say that the soundtracks are rather silly and lame. This really depends on your tastes in music, but I personally found most of the soundtracks amazing. While some of them do come off as silly, the osts all fit the scene and atmosphere very well. The voice acting is also equally impressive, with each of the voice actors fitting their characters perfectly, and also being able to deliver emotion, or intensity depending on the scene. 
 
The characters in the Straw Hat Pirates are special. Not really because they will be the most unique characters you'll ever see, but because of the bond they share with each other. The characters are very well developed, have interesting/fun personalities, and most importantly, they are easy to love. They all have interesting backgrounds, some which are tragic, and are striving to achieve their dreams as they adventure together. As they travel along, they start to care for each other so deeply to the point where they would do anything to protect each other, creating extremely powerful and emotional episodes or arcs at some point. 
The Straw Hat crew members are exceptionally great, but the supporting characters themselves are no slouch either. Most of them are designed well and have unique, interesting personalities. Unlike many anime, they aren't just pushed to the side, no. Most of them have interesting, yet traguc backgrounds and goals,  and you can't help but cheer for them as they try to achieve their own goals. Some even are just as lovable as the main characters themselves! Hell, I even cheered for some of the antagonists at one point as well, as they were just too likable and unique.  
 
One Piece is an amazing anime. Although not perfect, it still is one of the most fun and entertaining experience I've ever had. I know many people who won't even give One Piece a chance for couple of reasons. Most are turned away by the art, some are discouraged because of the episode count, and some are even victims of the infamous 4kids dub (which was HORRIBLE btw). Well, I can't force people to watch it, but I really think everyone should give One Piece at least a chance. In one anime, you'll be taken through a journey full of adventure, good action, comedy, and drama. Who knows? You could enjoy the hell out of this show, and possibly forget about every downsides I mentioned above.  
 
I sure did, and maybe you could as well, if you just give it a try.

    As of writing this review, One Piece has just reached 700 episodes. 
 
After seeing every episode I feel like I can write a pretty accurate review of One Piece so far. It took me 1 year to catch up to the current episode. I started in April 2014 and caught up April-May 2015 and I have to say I am glad I took my time compared to most people. 
 
The story starts off relatively slow as they introduce the base characters of the crew but it picks up once they've all been established properly. For an anime like this it gets incredibly dark which is what most non-watchers would expect. 
 
The soundtrack is pure 10/10. 90% of the songs are orchestrated beautifully and match the scene perfectly. Not much else to say. 
 
The artwork/animation is top notch with only a few scenes being a bit rushed. People tend to use these scenes as ""Toei ruinin muh anime"" but it's fine. People should stop complaining about it. 
 
All the Straw Hats are fleshed out well and you know why they're in the crew and how they got there. Many feels to be had. 
 
People usually wonder about the dub of this anime. I have watched both subbed and dubbed of it and I have to say overall that subbed is better purely because the Luffy voice actress in Japanese nails it. All the other voices in the dub (apart from Robin) are equal to the sub version if not better. However the JP voice actress nailed the role perfectly and it can't be competed with. 
 
Overall I have to give it a 10. While it has a few bumpy arcs, the overall story is something you rarely get to experience. Take your time if you do watch it. I know people who powered through it in a month and regretted it. Once you catch up, don't forget to read the manga!

    Plot. 
The last words spoken by the Pirate King before his execution, have inspired many: «My treasure? Take them if you can! Now you know where I left them!». The legendary phrase Gold D. Roger marked the start the Great Age Pirates — thousands of people in the pursuit of their dreams went to the Grand Line, the most dangerous place in the world, wanting to become owners of a mythical treasure... 
But every year the romantics became less their gradually squeezed pragmatic pirates-robbers who loot was much closer than some «worthless dreams». But then, one fine day, a seventeen year old Luffy cherished dream has executed childhood — went to sea. His goal — neither more nor less than become the new Pirate King. Over the short enough term the young captain manages to put together a team consisting of not less ambitious adventure seekers. 
And let by them driven by completely different aspirations, most importantly, these guys are not as important money and fame, how much much more valuable — the principles and loyalty to friends. And yet — the service of a dream. 
Well, while on the Grand Line swim such people, the Great Age Pirates will always be with us! 
 
Brief introduction. 
The story itself, though quite simple at first glance, but it quickly evolved into something huge. Most of the very first episode focuses on team building and meet new characters. Although this is certainly not enough more action. But as soon as they catch up with the Grand Line, adventure go for adventure, and you can see a lot of fantastic-story arcs. Battles and fights well developed; fight the final boss is always completely full of epic. The episodes are full of lots of funny moments, not too much and not too little. There's always a delicate balance of action and humor. 
 
Design. 
At the expense of design. It is true, it is completely different from all the anime I've seen. But even so, you'll love it. Style change over time... still would! After a few years will pass and «One Piece» we will see in «new light». Cinematography (4:3) change in the anamorphic image (16:9). As a result, there will be more clear, bright, clean and colorful image. 
But despite these changes, the schedule 1999 has not lost its uniqueness and I love her still. )) 
 
Review. 
Some few years ago, «One Piece» promptly rushed into my life by becoming an integral part of it, decorate her own, unprecedented up to this point, paints. This anime was the ray of light, which I did not have all the time... a ray that shines to this day and will shine for me a very long time, if not forever. In fact, «One Piece» became my way of life, without exaggeration. In it there are so thin «highlight» that if the catches, then so thoroughly and deeply that permeates through the soul, and forget it ever anime, but rather that track that has left more than 350+ episodes of view, which looked at one go in record time, it is impossible. Of course, this is purely my personal opinion and experience. 
«One Piece» — is a constant drive that runs through you from head to toe. It's so crazy adventure, colorful characters, and a great atmosphere, I believe that «One Piece» One of the few things that can be considered perfect. At the moment, more than 678 episodes drawn, and it's not a terrible figure to show, on the contrary, each episode is so interesting and fascinating that when viewing exactly half of the episodes, you begin to frighten the thought that there is still the same, and in fact looks at one go and episodes of flying is not noticeable. 
«One Piece» — is one big pirate adventure story, with the supervision of that, you become a witness, unimaginable adventure through the red tape that goes the theme of dreams. This is another huge plus for the whole idea of ​​«One Piece», for this many thanks Ode Eiichiro. Dream - it's an incentive to go forward, to make progress, as well as live. This motif is thoroughly imbued with the entire anime series and its protagonists, who are each his dream, but they are making it all together. 
To sum up the above logic, although I believe that I could write at length on several pages of this wonderful anime, the conclusion suggests itself: «One Piece» — a bright pearl among all the anime genre shounen and adventure anime-series. He remains in my heart for ever, and do not forget while watching another anime. Those who did not look — look, those who viewed themselves soon want to reconsider. Of course this is again my personal opinion, but, hell, «One Piece» — a masterpiece! 
 
Soundtrack. 
I want to give due attention to the soundtrack. He is a great! Not only OST's but OP&ED. 
 
General impressions. 
Best Anime and best Shounen who saw and probably ever will see. Anime rest on his background seems boring and predictable set of fillers...  
 
Finally. 
The most beautiful and noble of all the anime I've ever seen. I think that «One Piece» in Russian — a world of the soul. 
 
Verdict. 
Masterpiece! 10/10.

    ""i have decided to be the king of pirates, so if i die fighting for that, that is fine with me"" this single line was so heart touching that made me a huge fan of one piece. The plot is very good, each and every arcs are really amazing the fights the humor everything went well except for one this sometimes the pace gets a bit slow. One thing fascinates me is the suspense,especially one piece the treasure except for the author no one have any clues 
 
Art 
The art work is pretty bad at the beginning i know at that time there wasn't any good animation but the developer tried their best to do and the art work is getting day by day. 
 
 
sound 
Oh! the music is superb, luffy's battle theme song always rings in my head, the opening and ending songs were great, the ost music is very good 
 
Character 
It is quite rare to see this kind of development of the characters like luffy and all of them had to work hard to get strong its not like they got powers from the beginning like other series, ihave to say the author did a pretty good job about the characters as if they were meant to be perfect from the beginning. The bond between the crew is inseparable, they would gladly risk their life to save their friends without out thinking twice. This gave me some feel to the series. 
 
 
Enjoyment 
i enjoyed it from top to bottom, i haven't experience a single moment that i was feeling bored, i watched 600 episodes non stop, i knew that i had to catch up to the recent episodes and thats why i stopped watching other shows for it and i am happy that i took the right decision. Normally i watch 5 to 7 episode a day but when i was watching one piece i use to watch 20 to 25 episodes a day that was a lot for me as well. i liked most of the part more like 98% of the show but i think the pace in which it is going is a bit slow not that much so 2% dislike for it other than that its amazing people should give it a try once

    When I first learned about One Piece, when i was a one track Narutard, i always said ""The art is weird"" or ""The voices suck"". And then i watched the original japanese version. The voices were amazing. Over time, i truly came to repsect Oda for making a unique style, and i love it now. The story is enthralling, and will take you for many spins. It truly makes you emotional at moments, and I adore the character development. Watch one piece. Its truly a thrill to watch and read.

the serie can get you laugh, cry and hype you up 
 
should you watch One piece? YES

    The overall premise of One Piece isa that the world is divided between pirates and Marines!  
Constently at each others necks resulting in grand battles, exhilarting fights, tear- worthy moments, meaning a whole lot of snot! 
Such moving story lines, that truly make you fall in love with the characters, and become invested in their dreams and aspirations. 
If during this anime you don't get emotionally moved, then your most likely dead inside.  
As we watch our heros battle their harships and as we fanboy/fangirl over their sheer badassness moments that not even the biggest narutards can object to! 
If this review will get at least one person to watch One Piece than I'd write it a thousand times.  
The voice acting is fantastic, especially when emotional moments are demanding more. 
Themes such true companionship, following your dreams no matter the hardship, and truly putting your life on the line for what you believe in, are played out truly beautifully. 
Almost changing part of the person experiencing the world of One Piece! Hands down this is truly a wonderful adventure. 
If i had one wish is that One Piece's grand existence never disappears, because this anime/manga is importilised in the heart of it's viewers. 
By the first episode this 'Monkey . D. Luffy' will have an impression on you whether you like it or not, and One Piece will simply never end from there.

    Life changing experience 
One piece is a very enjoyable adventure story with some really good characters and cool fights. Most people like one piece mainly because of this and because it has been good since it started. It never leaves you bored or disappointed. Even only for this it is good enough to call it one of the best anime of all time. But if you are looking for more than just that, if you need something more, i am sure you will find even more than you would expect. I am not saying that meaning is only good thing in things and thing can't be good if they don't have meaning in them, i believe art can have 0 meaning and still be amazing or can be ugly but have so much meaning that it still makes great art. I think One Piece is in perfect balance of how it looks and what meanings it has behind those looks. It kinda reminds me of The Matrix with that (great action movie and great meaning and philosophy behind it). 
 
I also want to write about main complains people have against One Piece. First would be animation. When i started watching One Piece i didn't like animation either, but than i got used to it. Not only that animation got much better after years and now i actually like it. I think the type of animation One Piece has may not be the best but its use to showcase character emotions is perfectly used (feeling can be exaggerated but it makes you feel it which is great use of animation in my opinion). Second main complaint people have would be that it is too long. It is too long but as I said before One piece will not make you feel bored. There are not much fillers in One Piece and when there are they are pretty enjoyable too. The last complaint would be that its story is repetitive. Most people who say that have watched like first few arcs when they were kids and they think that all there is to it is: they go to an island, fight, win, repeat. Well i understand why they say that but that's not really true if you watch it you will understand its not. Also people say it has too simple goal, Main hero wants to find the great treasure One Piece and become pirate king. It's not that much simple, in reality he doesn't really care about treasure or becoming a king, in his mind pirate king is a man who is most free, who can do anything he wants and that's his goal to be the most free person in the world. People who have a feeling in their life that people are trying to pull you down, trying to close your mind, trying to make you the same way they are will understand how much that means and that it is much more than just a treasure or a name of a king. 
 
The story of One Piece may be the best part of it. IT's long but not really drawn out. Eiichiro Oda created a whole world to explore together with great characters. And there are some things Oda obviously planed and wrote years before we saw it on anime and when we did it left mind-blown. And there are more thing waiting to be revealed in future too. It's a story about everything. Story about birth, death, being a parent, about brotherhood, about sacrifice, about loss, about friendship, about war, about peace, about freedom, about dreams, about life and existence itself and SO MUCH MORE there is no way you can count a all of it down. And it never get too annoying with one thing. It never gives you too much of anything that can make you bored. The story writing is so good that some 1 episode flashbacks can be as good and even better than whole great movies. For example one of flashback stories really reminded me of a great movie Life is beautiful and i even felt like this was better written. 
 
One piece changes your life. It changes you but it never gives you straight teaching how you should be or not be. There are just so many kinds of great characters and they just do their things and you relate to it. It never is like marines are good and pirates are bad, or pirates are good and marines are bad, there are good and bad people on both sides. Yes our main heroes are pirates but they never say pirates are all good, we see some pirates killing innocent people and marines who don't care about people. Characters never stand there and say something like: ""oh i am a good person and you should be too"". What you learn from One Piece comes itself. You watch characters, they go through something, that changes them and One Piece makes you feel like you are going through the same thing with them and it comes to you more like experience than as a lesson. You feel it and you get it. It never tells you what is right and what is wrong or what is good and what is bad. One Piece just makes you feel what characters feels and after that its up to you, its your own decision if you want to or what you will learn something from that feeling. 
 
In conclusion i would like to say that One Piece is not one of the best anime but also one of the best masterpieces of art ever created (and it's not even near finishing yet and i can already say so). One Piece won't make you disappointed. It may not mean as much to most of the other people out there but i can assure you at least this much that it will be enjoyable to watch for everyone. 
 
P.S. Don't watch English dub.

    One Piece is one of those anime that really pull you into its world. It had me hooked from episode 1 and before I knew it 8 months had passed and I had caught up on its many episodes, movies, specials, and any other content I could see. Now every Sunday when the new episode comes out I'm like a kid on Christmas morning. I know I'll be sailing with Monkey D. Luffy until the show's conclusion.  
Story: 10  
I gave the story a 10 because of how imaginative it truly is. Revelations and new developments in this story are constantly coming at you. This means the story never gets repetitive or boring. Additionally the story will have you asking yourself many interesting philosophical questions. Here are just a few of the questions this show may have you thinking about: 
What is Justice? 
What is good and evil?  
What is really important in life?  
What does it mean to be free?  
Better yet it does this without ever feeling preachy.  
The story also has great themes of friendship (friendships as strong as familial ties) and amazing adventure!  
Art: 10  
The art-style in this show is really unique. It is instantly recognizable and fits the show perfectly. All the color really brings the expansive One Piece world to life. Character designs are all very distinct and some of the most eye catching in anime. The fights and all the special attacks are breathtaking.  
Sound: 10  
The soundtrack in this show is extremely versatile and varied. It has pieces that fit every mood. The openings and endings all sound great. These tracks really provoke emotion. Songs that will make you smile ear to ear, songs that will make you sob, songs that make you feel tense and excited - It has it all!  
Characters: 10  
One Piece really shines in this category. Every character has a distinct personality, motives, beliefs, and their chance to shine in the story. The cast of characters are extremely lovable and quirky. Monkey D. Luffy and his crew all have hearts of gold.  
Enjoyment 10:  
I find One Piece extremely enjoyable. It has everything I am looking for in an anime. It keeps me excited, invested, and completely enamored with the characters and plot. It pulls you into its adventure so well!  
Overall: 10  
I would strongly advise watching this show. It is a time investment to watch all the way up to date, but I did it and it was well worth it to me. It is the kind of show that has something for everyone and so can be enjoyed by nearly anyone! Happy sailing!

    One piece is one of the best anime i've ever watched. I really had a great time watcing. I have nothing negative to say about it. The story is great..the art is good and the characters are just awesome!! I found myself fangirling so many times! Well, i'll have to admit that at first it wasn't that exciting and the art wasn't that good but now is so exciting that i find it very hard to wait every week for the new episode to be released and the art has improved too..Another thing that i liked was how nicely were the fillers put in the story. They weren't too long and they were put so cleverly in the story that i didn't even realize it was fillers. I also liked the comedy very much. It made me laugh so much so many times..!!!

    One Piece is honestly the best show I’ve ever watched in my entire life. What Oda, the creator of OP, gave us, was more than just a story - he gave us an entire world, filled with unique people with their own backstories. It takes the time to tell us about the different characters Luffy meets along the way, and all of their stories are somehow interconnected, whether it’s tragic or happy or strange or mysterious.  It really puts everything in perspective, y’know? That everyone on planet earth has their own story and there’s no end to it. 
 
It takes the time to show how its multidimensional characters grow, change, and how it affects the world. Or how it doesn’t affect the world. Like that dog back in Orange Town, who was just trying to protect his late master’s house… tons of instances like that is why I love One Piece. It’ll make you cry, laugh, smile, squeal in excitement, and just be in awe of how well put-together the world of One Piece is. 
 
It’s not just all about the characters, though. The overarching plot of One Piece is amazing, as well. In the world ruled by a corrupt government and pirates constantly battling for power, there’s always something new to see, and always something else to affect the plot. The essence of a plot is that it’s formed by hundred and hundreds of character decisions, and you begin to understand the story as you see said decisions being made. You’re shown all of the main character’s goals, and why. You’re shown why villains do what they do, and sometimes you even feel bad for them - like Arlong or Hody Jones, who grew up in hatred of humans from what they’d done to Fishman Island. You’re shown all of the evil of the world, and how it’s always going to be there, and that makes the world of OP that more realistic. You’re shown all of the good of the world, and how some even die in the name of justice, and how some even used to be villains. Everything you see in One Piece just… makes sense. It’s all interwoven - the characters, the backstories, the plot, everything.  
 
The wonderful world building, the incredible cast of rich, relatable characters, and the plot that makes you just ache to see the next episode makes watching One Piece through all the way worth it.  
 
I will say, this show wasn’t even in my top ten until around episode 100, and not in the top three until around three hundred. The first 20 or so episodes felt like a drag. Many are turned off by One Piece’s art, and others dislike the slow pace. I wasn’t too fond of either at first. Now, I believe One Piece is the best show - no, the best story in general to ever exist. 
 
If you haven’t watched One Piece, watch it. Now.  
 
 
Story: 10 - amazing, well-thought out plot 
Art: 7 - after the timeskip the art gets worse 
Sound: 8 - Music is awesome and catchy, & sound effects are shared w/ DBZ 
Character: 10 - great development and emotional moments 
Enjoyment: 10 - from squealing in excitement to being on the edge of my seat, damn have I enjoyed this anime

    One piece is my favorite anime of all time.  
I started watching it when i was around 8-10 years old, it was on the morning tv shows i would wake up early just to watch it. Later that day i would meet with my friends, we would chose one of the characters and play, i was Zoro so i had to go around looking for sticks to pretend they d be my all mighty swords. After it stopped airing i grew up and i forgot about it. At the age of 15 i don't even remember how or why i started re-watching it and since that day i ve been hooked up to the story line. 
 
For those who don't like long anime, why are you even here? One piece is known to be the longest anime airing, please don't belittle the show because of that, there are plenty of other shorter anime to watch. 
 
So here starts my review! (took me long enough huh) 
The story is about a boy who aims find the legendary treasure One piece and become the pirate King. Why you may ask? For wealth, fame, power? NO! because he wants to be the freest man in the world. Personally, i don't want him to find it, because when that happens it will mean one piece has ended and am gonna cry my self to sleep that night. (pretty mature ain't i huh) The show starts a bit slow with the main character recruiting friends but for me i didn't even realize how the time (episodes) passed. The anime offers you both great comedy and action at the exact amount you d want it, with great jokes and funny faces as well as amazing fights that aren't only about getting stronger just from yelling that you love your friends. Furthermore, as the story progress, it becomes a bit more serious but without ever lacking of comical moments. What i love about it is, that the protagonist doesn't always win, making your adrenaline pump because you don't expect the same result every single time. To conclude, the plot surprised me many times, a minor detail you saw at around episode 60 ends up being very important at for example episode 300 and you stand watching it and wander ""was the author always planning to do this? how can he think so far ahead"" 
The characters, every character is unique they have their own goals and aren't simple side kicks for the plots sake. Every character has a deep background, it makes you feel that you know them better, you end up laughing with them, crying with them, feeling their agony (am i getting to cliche? ) And that doesn't only apply to the main crew but foes and allies alike. Off course there will be characters you like more and characters you wish they die but never actually do but that happens because of the big character variety it has i think it s normal one or two are not that likable (for example whiny princesses that need help) Also, the characters progress through the story even the air head protagonist gets more serious by the time you ve reached half of the series. 
So, i ve blabbered enough, if you like long series, amazing action, comedy, character development i think you should give One piece a try. 
 
P.S. Does anyone actually scroll down to the last page to even see this ?

    It's a giant part of my life, I said I started watching this on 2009, and I did from the beginning, but on 2006 I started doing AMVs (Anime Music Videos) and I would listen to the 6th opening everyday, I love it. All in it. All characters, all their behaviour, I am so much like Luffy in terms of personality (and apethite, believe me, I know :3)  
 
This is better than Dragon Ball. Even if dragon ball was awesome, this is WAY more ""mature"" and it gives you tears and an unlimited number of lessons of life. 
 
One piece is the way to go! You might find voring first episodes, but after you watch 100 You only think: LUFFY LUFFY LUFFY LUFFY! ;D

    The most riveting story board I've come across. The characters show great dept in effort put forth in creating the tone of this show which changes accordingly. One piece is truly the most unique anime I know of. Though it has a bit a rough start (and was giving a bad rep due to 4kids tv's censorship+editing) it sets it a fire in the heart that only ever grows.

    This is gonna be short review that might seem like I'm about to commit seppuku. By the way it might contain a massive spoiler so that i might get my point across  
 
I like One Piece it's an awesome anime with lovable characters and a great story line.  The fights are good and the progression is at a steady pace but it really isn't for everyone, doesn't mater when you started watching it or at what age but it might not be for everyone and the reason I feel like such is its conflict/fights in it.  This has time and time again got me frustrated to a point where i put off the show and get on a self put hiatus.  People might say I'm being petty but it is really annoying, it feels like every fight they either have to stop and talk about their feelings or the good or bad guys trying and convince  
the either side that their way is best.  I know most shounen shows do this but how one piece does it is to a frustrating level.   
 
Where my spoiler comes in is in the fight between Luffy and Doflamingo.  Since this is after the time skip and a lot of episodes into the show you could say why is it that this particular fight is the reason I'm writing this review, well I always had a slight prick in the back of my mind when i watch the show and never really knew what it was about until i watching this sequence of episodes.  The fight just drags on and on and never really reaches a point till luffy unleashes his bouncy man move.   
 
The reason this fight is so draggy are those that i previously mention and why i wrote the review is when i re-watched Naruto Shippuden and watched the pain fight. It blew my mind and i got chills, the exact same ones i got when i was in grade 9 watching it for the first time and then it hit me the way this fight is portrayed and done is so good.   It give you the time for breathers and then throws you back in the action and if one piece could do this it might be skyrocket up my favourite anime list!

    if you watch it from the beginning you will notice how fun and great the show is and by the time you reach near episode 300 the show starts to show signs of BS like prolonging episodes to make so its an episode per chapter when the show is catching up to the manga and in later episode by the makers of Narutos anime and one piece having more money than any company  they still lower the quality from time to time even during easily animated scenes but other than that the show in all is fun for me it might be for you if you like the first 3 episodes

    One Piece has it's issues, and I am not going to deny that. The main issue I have, with the show, is the amount of episodes spent on a particular fight. To allow for more chapters of the manga to be written, a fight was stretched out to fill time. A normal episode of an anime is equivalent two chapters of the manga, the anime now only covers one chapter of material each episode.  
 
Continued signs, and evidence, are still in episodes every once in a while. To compensate for this, each manga chapter now has more content. Even with more manga content, some scenes will be mad longer than necessary. This someone comes off as satirical, and self aware, since the anime has so many episodes; the scenes come across as somewhat comedic. 
 
With all these issues in mind, I give One Piece a 10/10 (masterpiece).

    I will do overall review for One Piece again. Cause many things changed for the good and some for the bad. Im going to talk about the story, the Art, the sound, the characters and the enjoyment. Be warned cause spoilers can be contained. 
 
 
Story 
 
A lot of people would say that the story is the best. I would agree partially because  there are aspects that makes the story a bit too much repetetive. Its the concept of the story. For example the travel to every Island where the strawhats save the people from a villain or the sad backstories of every character. It gets really boring every time. What Oda can do really good is to describe problems with the world or islands. That is different every time. I like how deep it gets. We saw drugs, criminality, corruption, unfairness, wrong justice and so on. I love it in One Piece. 
In my opinion the concept of haki ruined a lot of things in One Piece. THe devil fruits have no more importance to win a fight, Especially armament haki and observation haki lets you dominate you in a fight. 
The story is toooooo much streched. OP should have ended long ago.  
 
Art 
 
Because of the fact that One Piece is a weekly anime the art suffered a lot of times. it was never consistent. Before timeskip it was a ride from different sheets and after time skip it stayed more consistent. In my opinion the wano art is the best. After that thriller Bark and then Enies Lobby. Yeah the wano art is now my favourite. It changed since Fukusawa stepped aside. He was was the one who was responsible for the Whole cake island arc. He did a wonderful job. I loved the last episode that he directed directly. Soul Pocus will be my favourite song of One Piece.  
Now lets beginn talking about Nagamine the director after Fukusawa. The character designer Hisada stepped aside too. I love that he stopped, because his sheets became worse after timeskip. After Matsuda took over the characters look more fresh than ever. Im interested how much Nagamines direction will be in Wano. Cause the arc is still going on and I dont want to talk so soon about this arcs art. 
 
 
Sound 
 
One Piece ha one of the best soundtracks but most of the times they use the same soundtracks over and over again. It gets really boring. THey use some sound from the film but not every time. 
In WCI i loved how they made a lot of tracks and musicials. Im excited about more Wano Soundtracks. I hope we will hear a lot of good tracks! 
 
Characters 
 
The characters that are introduced have a deep backstory and a lot of funny behavior. But I want to really say that it gets really boring by the time. The panty joke of Brook and the hit from nami after that  for example gets old.. What I really hate is that the Strawhats are not all strong. We have Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and JInbei who are really strong. The others like Robin, Usopp, Nami, Chopper and Brook are not that strong and can not keep up with the other strawhats.  
 
Enjoyment 
 
Here we come to a topic that has a real issue. The enjoyment. The problem with the anime since Thriller Bark arc is the unbearable pacing. We had Luffy running in marineford endlessly, a 6 months of Katakuri fighting Luffy, 3 months of shouting wedding cake by big mom etc. The manga adaptation is really like 10-13 chapters an episode. Yeah I understand that Toei is bounded to Stakehoulders like Shueisha and Fuji TV but It gets really problematic for me as a viewer to enjoy a series...

    One Piece is, magic. No show like this on earth. Able to consistently create extremely unique and imaginative aspects without being nonsensical. The PLOT, art style, characters, the backstories, the antagonists, the plot twists. Just absolutely incredible. As early as Nami’s Arc was when I saw One Piece for how truly amazing it was. That was the first of many of other arcs were I was moved to tears, ball in my throat level stuff. The Author of One Piece is incredible. Period. As for the characters; Samurai Champloo dub, Yu Yu Hakusho dub levels of chemistry. 
 
Despite semi-popular believe, One Piece did in fact kept it's momentum and magic after the time-skip. The most note-worthy, unmagical thing that's been added to One piece is this really really bad habit of stretching out arcs. There are 3 arcs in mind that were just insane. But yes, still amazing stories that tug your heart and great action scenes, animation, but when One Piece decides to put the story in syrup and take 15 episodes to progress something, they will do it with ease. Not my thing. As a non-manga guy, I've been told the newest arc airing and onwards is suppose to be a real treat and  departure from the inconsistencies. (Wano Arc is indeed rising to the occasion).  
 
Luffy is also an idiot but you are rewarded with Luffy going HAM at some point. Through the history of One Piece, the fights rarely ever disappoint. The OPs are always super sick as well. 
 
Additionally to the stretched out arcs comment, there are fillers in One Piece and some of them are in post time skip as well. To not making things any harder, I did check the fillers lists and it's really important to make sure you know exactly what you're skipping because few of them episodes advance the story/character develop. The cast is so awesome so of course I’d like to indulge in some fillers but a lot of the time they seriously come at VERY INOPPORTUNE times so naturally I want to skip them or at least the “true fillers”. I will watch them all real soon since I'm all caught up to the actual show.  
 
Objectively, One Piece is certainly a very high quality show in all aspects and one I think everybody should witness it first hand. I was very intimidated by the episodes count (as past first-timers usually were) so I put it off for a long time but once you suck it up and run though a few episodes, it's one of those shows you will not put down once you start. I'm here to stay. Sanji will find that All Blue!

    Plot(7/10): 
One piece starts off with a typical shounen plot but actually gets you hooked as it goes on with the story. It started with Luffy announcing his dream of being the pirate king and finding a crew that would help him sail through the seas to find the legendary treasure ""one piece"". The series is a great series for entertainment. The longer you watch it the more you get attached to the characters and the more it becomes fun to watch. I like how it foreshadows the future events in the story and how in each arc we learn more and more about the vast world of one piece and how the things that we learn makes us eager to learn more about the world of one piece. I also appreciate how connected the arcs are with each other and none of the arcs feel like a waste of time watching since for every arc we would get something that would greatly contribute to the development of the story. Even some filler arcs are fun to watch and it sometimes feels like you’re actually watching canon episodes. Since it is a well-known fact that Oda himself gives ideas on what should be included in the filler arcs and he sometimes adds stuff that aren’t in the manga to the anime. I highly recommend watching G-8 filler arc even though it is a filler arc since it fits well with the original story. 
 
While it is a fun show to watch there are some things that needs to be improved. The lack of deaths in the series makes the show annoying. There are a lot of characters that we are almost sure are dead that somehow manages to survive their inescapable deaths. This is more seen among allies of luffy. There are also a lot of inconsistencies in the plot yet that is to be expected from a big series like one piece. Some of the stuff are left unexplained leave the viewers clueless on how it happened. The pacing starting from thriller bark (around ep 300) gets slow yet picks up again in impel down arc (around ep 400). 
 
Art/animation (4/10) 
I personally don’t like the art of one piece that much. However one piece is an anime that has been going on since 2000 so it’s understandable that the animation would be poor in quality. The animation even in the fight scenes doesn’t look that good and sometimes makes climactic battles less exciting. 
Sound Effects (9/10) 
The sound effects for one piece is amazing. It blends well with the themes of the story. The sound effects hypes me up every time and makes scenes more exciting. The opening themes of the anime sounds great. The voice acting in the anime is great and voices of the characters fits them well and doesn’t get too annoying unlike some other shows. 
Characters (9/10) 
One of the things I like most about one piece is the characters. Each and every character that are introduced contributes to the development of the story. Some will help the crew, some will be an obstacle for the crew and some will actually join the crew. I like how each member of the straw hat grows as the story goes on and how each doesn't only follow Luffy blindly but each of them has their own goal that they must achieve. We can clearly see that oda gives emphasis to every member of the straw hat and not only on luffy since each of them are given obstacles that would make them grow individually. 
What I don’t like about the characters is Luffy himself. I don’t like how he is just the typical shounen main character who is dumb and just rushes in without thinking and somehow still manages to survive. However in the recent episodes Luffy’s character improves as he faces challenges that are too big for him forcing him to grow stronger in all aspects.

    This is a good show that asks too much of the average fan. 
 
I read the manga back in the Shounen Jump days and really like the art direction and stylization. It is a very fun and easy to follow show, with simple character motivations that all make pretty straightforward sense, except maybe for Nami. The arcs blend together and propel the characters onward, I ALWAYS felt like they were on the correct path and didn't feel like they were just twiddling their thumbs, waiting for the plot to happen. I stopped around episode 100 and don't really care to finish it, I feel like there would be a good plot waiting for me but I could never find a character I connected with on a personal level. The powers all seemed pretty logical and nothing ever seemed to contradict a rule that was established earlier, or if they did, it didn't bother me, as that wasn't the main focus of the story nor did it ever seem to impact whether or not the difficulty spiked for the main characters. 
 
Unfortunately all the characters kind of have the same basic facial structure, with all of them tending to blend together in my mind, so remembering who is who was difficult, which also turned me off and alienated the cast from me, I hated the reindeer, the idea of the setting being a pirate-filled ocean was cool at first but it seemed like most of the story took place on land and they never really ""pirated""... Kind just seemed like the word ""pirate"" meant ""warrior"" or ""fighter"" in this world. Not a huge flaw, but a flaw nonetheless.  
 
It's a good anime and a great manga, but it suffers from too many tropes and lack of individuality to be considered a truly great work of art, to me.

    I love One Piece. I love its story, the way they set a goal and deliver to their audience, the character developement, background... you get it. The thing is, I can not recommend this anime to anybody. All the things mentioned above are found in the manga and in the anime, but the latter absolutely destroys the hype, the pacing, and the viewer's eyeballs. So I just recommend reading the manga. 
 
The reasons I cant recommend it are the following: 
- As of right now, one chapter of manga equals one episode of anime, meaning that every anime episode is extremely slow paced and with excessively long and frequent freeze frames. 
- The animation is just dreadful... at the beginning it was fine, but around episode 400 the animation has gone downhill non-stop. And yes, I am aware that the animation gets better on the latest arc, but still, it's a good 500 episodes of thrash animation. 
 
It is really hard to watch something that you love get mistreated. That is why I decided to stop watching one piece and started reading it, the experience has been amazing so far, living each moment again, with proper pacing this time, and not feeling like I am wasting my time. If you want an amazing story with great, lovable characters and have a lot of time to spare, then prepare to embark in the amazing experience that is One Piece, but please, don't watch, just read.

    One Piece is the best anime there is. I have watched quite a lot of animes so far and at first I was a bit sceptical about One Piece. When I started watching the shonen, it seemed childish and boring. Art work is different and takes time getting used to. So after going through the first episodes I seriosly thought about dropping the whole thing. Soooo glad I didn't!!!!  
 
After a while I realised how unique One Piece is. The story is so well thought, like no other anime.  It can make you cry with the characters, laugh with them. Fights are epic! You really get hooked on the story, awlays wondering what's gonna happen next, what mystery is gonna be revelaed next.  
  
If you haven't seen it yet. DO IT!!!

    one piece is one of most unique shouen series in history bcoz of certain elements like : 
1.focus on each crew member showing why they are the way they are 
apart from main protagonist luffy every other crew mate has a proper back story,character,skill ,fighting style and a propose on the ship 
2.natural flow of story : another grt thing about it .Oda sensei's way of story telling unlike other shounen manga like dragonballz and naruto charcter dont just power up arc by arc as the story progress they grow stronger with time 
3.even if the show is 700+ episodes you don't get bored coz each island has its unique traits and villains and fun 
4.all around one piece make it worth your time

    I've always wanted to watch One Piece, after I've finished the exams, and i got my wish come true. Mostly, I had series of illnesses which were PAINFUL and ladies and gentlemen, One Piece kept my SANITY!! 
 
I can't thank enough, for the hours of enjoyment, determination and creativity given by Oda sensei. The jokes are original, you can keep on watching them and laugh. Music is good, needs improvement. One Piece had series of characters with different personalities.  
 
Art also needs improvement, but i think it's not because of the ability, OP has a unique style. Story was quite great, even though some arcs were way too long, the jokes keep you going in for more!! 
 
Overall, it's a great anime to watch! THANKS ONE PIECE!

    I know. 10 out of 10? Really? One Piece? Yeah right. 
 
Here me out. Is the art scaring you away? Some of the more ridiculous aspects of the characters, or plot? (There are a lot of those) The huge length of the series? (621+ episodes at present, 12 movies, 7 specials) 
 
Well let me ask you this, do you like an anime that is filled to the brim with unique characters, a fantastic story, extremely creative ideas, amazing action, hilarious comedy, extremely emotional moments, excellent drama, and wonderful world-building? An anime that is a far cry from other, more generic Shonen affair like Naruto (Dragon Ball Z) and Bleach (Yu Yu Hakusho)? An anime that has been consistently good, no, improved steadily over 14 years (manga's been going 16 years) and just keeps getting even better? If so you'll love One Piece. 
 
Eichiiro Oda has simply created a masterpiece here, One Piece fires on all cylinders and always succeeds. While wrapped up in zaniness (rubber pirates, transforming reindeer, weird powers, weirder designs, oh my!) One Piece has, at it's heart, such lovable, interesting, and unique characters who go on such a long, hard journey full of adventure. Along the way are plenty of heart-rending moments, One Piece is the only anime that's made me cry, and it's done so more than once! 
 
Not one character is the same, and each play off each other really well, to make a good deal of the comedy mentioned earlier. The characters are all very well developed and thought out, they each go through hard struggles as they attempt to bring their dreams and the dreams of their fellow friends to reality. The watcher becomes engrossed and involved with them, pretty soon you'll fall in love. 
 
The fights are incredible, the powers creative. The characters struggling in these conflicts are so interesting, both the Straw Hat Crew themselves, and the enemies they fight, you won't want to leave your seat. 
 
The sense of friendship, adventure, and fun are so contagious, you won't be able to help but smile after a particularly hard fight is done, or a new location is explored. No one location is the same, everywhere the crew visits is unique and interesting. 
 
The art might be off-putting, but I've grown to love it. I'm, sure not everyone will love it like I do, but I've heard of several fans who manage to at least like it a little. Sure it's weird. But it's much less generic looking than Bleach, for example. It adds a charm and a feel to One Piece that is all its own. 
 
The music is incredible. From the epic openings, to the adventurous endings, to the moving background music, this series delivers heavily in the music category. In some of the more emotional scenes the music really helps give that little push that sends a tear or two from my eye. In a scene where a fight is about to begin, tunes like Overtaken get you pumped up for the fight. The music on the high seas make you want to go adventuring with the Straw Hats as a pirate!The openings make you excited for the episode your'e about to watch, and the endings (which they later get rid of to make room for longer openings) make you want to watch the next one. The music goes the extra mile and makes One Piece more complete. 
 
Give it a chance, and you won't be disappointed, not one bit. I never expected One Piece to be my favorite anime, but it certainly has become so.

    Okay. One Piece, is easily the best anime I've seen so far. And I doubt I'll come across an anime better than OP.  
 
When I started watching OP, it was interesting. But it got boring quickly. I even dropped it around ep 50. But thanks to my cousin, who pushed me to continue watching, I continued. 
 
 It were a long, hundred some episodes I watched without really wanting to watch it. But it paid off. From there on, it became ridiculously great real quick.  
 
The story is what got me hooked in the first place, and the story just kept on progressing and progressing. The character development is outstanding, the emotional part is outstanding, and man, the comedy, is OUT. STANDING. I don't know how many times I've died laughing. And the potential of this anime is great, so it will only keep getting better and better.  
 
I haven't watched THAT many animes yet, but again, I doubt I'll come across an anime better than One Piece.

    For a long time, which series has been heralded as the best shounen of all time? DBZ? Hokuto? Naruto? Yu Yu Hakusho? 
 
Well it's neither. Because One Piece is one such shounen. Story wise, it is one of the best. The arcs protrayed are unique and interesting at every turn, with Oda always finding a way to surprise the reader with curve balls. The world of One Piece is one of the best, never have I seen such a world ripe with originality and creativity. 
 
Art wise? It evolves over time in the manga, and the anime art is a bit stagnant, but when the good fluid art is called for, it gets called. Not as good as most shounen but hey, art shouldn't be the be -all end-all. 
 
Sound? It's...okay. Some parts are good and unique and fit the story, although the soundtrack can get repetitive and they haven't really added anything new in a while. Plus the OP themes are hit or miss for me. 
 
The characters are fun to watch and it's cool to see them grow. Luffy? He's wiser now after the Marinford War(in his own way. See Fishman Island arc). Usopp? More like MANSOPP. I don't want to go paragraph into paragraph but all the characters grow and seeing them bloom is great. Plus they are fun to watch, love, hate, and admire. Plus there is some good comedy. 
 
Enjoyment? Easily a fun and enjoyable long running anime/manga. I enjoy every week there is a chapter or episode.

    If you looking for a good action/adventure/comedy anime with fun characters and a positive message I would try One Piece! 
One Piece is a anime/manga about Monkey D. Luffy along with his crew who set of on an adventure to find the treasure of Gol D. Roger and become the pirate king! 
While some dislike the art style i think it suits it well although, in the later episodes the quality drops a bit but, I would not let that turn you away but, if that does make you think twice try the manga. 
I have personally enjoyed every minute of One Piece and would highly recommend One Piece!

    Inherited Will, the Destiny of the Age, and the Dreams of its People. These are things that will not be stopped. As long as people continue to pursue the meaning of freedom, these things will never cease to be! 
Gol D. Roger 
 
As possibly derivable from the above quote. This is not just a story about some random pirate crew. But, contradictorily a story of adventure ,freedom ,friendship ,dream ,fate and resolve.  
One of the best out there, OP really has lived up to its name and is everyone's suitable cuisine. But, it is common for people who hasn't watched the series ignore it at a glance, mainly due to its cartoonish art. But that just mean that their sense of judgement is all clouded.  
 
BUT DON'T WORRY, WHEN alchemist111 IS HERE!!!(cause i'll set it right). 
 
Story-9/10  
Despite the the number of episodes it has, it garuntees 100% boredom free experience. The plot is interesting, despite the different arc's at times.  
The show's able to put up solid laughs often and some pretty excellent fights. Despite the odd art, the shows packs some fun.  
 
Art-8/10 
The art isn't that special and is just as i said above, has a rather odd and cartoony art. But this factor is not a burden to this epitome of a series. 
 
Sound-8/10 
Dont ask any questions and just go for the funimation dub, cause the other dubs seem to make the characters sound like kids. I mean, come on!! They must be at least 17. ''Oh god, Why art thou such mistress?''. And the OST isnt that bad either, but the dubbed one sounds better. 
 
Character-10/10 
Apart from the plot, the next interesting thing is the ships crew. Everyone has their way of being remembered by the viewers. Each of them has a certain ,character, personality and behaviour. And, the bond they carry with them has a significant role in their character development. Even though it may not seem like it cause, at times they act like , 
""I’ve set myself to become the King of the Pirates…and if I die trying…then at least I tried!"". 
Then after a moment they'll say, 
""If I get reincarnated…. I wanna become a clam.""  
 But then again their crew really does have some diversity ,indeed. 
 
Enjoyment-10/10 
Just as i said, this is an epitome of greatness. And such a series, will never fail to impress the viewer, even if it is a little bit.  
And as for the reluctants, i have one final thing to teach you.....""Never Judge A Book By Its Cover"".

    I know I could be overeacting but I think One Piece is the greatest shonen anime/manga ever. It's not overrated but underrated by people who thinks it is overrated. After watching, I started having less interest on average type of shonen anime except for Fairy Tail. Don't be misguided by ""A rubberman who wants find a treasure"" plot. The story has so many possibilities. Nevermind the art. I think it has the same art style as dragonball. People always says that Dragonball is like the greatest anime ever but I think One Piece is. It has the same quality of fight scenes, humor, art as dragonball but One Piece has a more deeper story line than dragonball. Since episode 1, the story of One Piece has only one goal that becomes broad and deep as the story progress unlike dragonball which is mostly about fighting every enemies that tries to invade planet earth. One Piece also has a great character development. Even supporting characters that you thought won't show up still shows up adding a great influence to the storyline. The only thing that I 'hate' about One Piece is that I just can't wait to see what happens at the end but it still has a long long long way to go.

    one piece in my opinion is a very good anime, alot of people might say its overrated, too long, too childish, too much stupid jokes and etc, and it totally is. but lets get serious for a moment 
 
just start watching, if you like it, watch more, if you dont, just stop, i dont understand how people can write comments here saying they hate this anime when they watched 600+ episodes, in my opinion i really like that the anime is long, after watching seven deadly sins, tokyo ghoul, code geass, hunter x hunter, full metal alchemist and alot more (btw i really recommend watching those animes) and after finishing it i was... truly sad, sad it ended, i really find it stupid but i actually cried when hunter x hunter ended, i hate losing a good anime,  the faith that an anime i truly love, One Piece will as alot of people say ""never end"" truly makes me happy, with Naruto dying and releasing too many fillers, and dragon ball super just releasing the same thing they showed in the movies in extreme detail, i escaped to one piece, dont regret that decision at all, im at 704 right now and still addicted to it, so please, dont listen to people who say its too long, too stupid and etc, just decide for yourself.

    One Piece was one of my favorite animes until episode 520, when they met back after 2 years. That was the last cool thing I saw in this show. The character become more stupid and they look stupid. Too much booobs. Most important was the style of the story telling, it changed. I loved the show, but I can't enjoy it any more. It become more like kids show, but with boooooobs.  
I finished my review, but the system required longer review. Every time I hit submit, it tell me please enter a longer review. This is the third time I hit submit, but same thing. Finaly....

    One Piece is as close as you can get to a perfect series. It puts Oda's hardwork from these past 20 years of putting his body through hell to produce the best of content for his fan's enjoyment. Character work, Backstories, Drama, Adventure, Mysteries, Over The Top Goals, World Building, you ask and Oda does it better than anyone. 
 
But Oda's work doesn't gets as much recognition from the newer generation to which 800+ episodes is a daunting task, which is true to say the least.  
Although getting into One Piece is hard to said the least i mean the number of episodes crushed my urge to watch the anime a couple of times until finally i decided to watch it. 
 
One Piece is all about pirates travelling through the vast seas looking for the great treasure named ""One Piece."" The one who will find the treasure will earn himself the title ""Pirate King"" something which every pirate on the seas wants to become.  
 
The former Pirate King, Gold Roger ushered the world into a great pirate era.  
 
""You want my treasure? You can have it! Search for it! I left everything i gathered together at that place!"" - Gold D Roger's dying words that drove countless people to become pirates in search of his treasure, One Piece. 
 
The Main Character named Monkey D Luffy idealizes Gold Roger and dreams of becoming the Pirate King by finding the One Piece. He is so obsessed with his dream, that his catchphrase is actually ""I am Luffy and i will be the king of pirates"" and he doesn't lets a single opportunity slide to let everyone knows about it. He later recruit his loyal crew as they travel through the harsh seas of the ""Grand Line"" while solving mysteries and defeating strong enemies in search of the One Piece and fulfill their individual dreams. 
 
If you want to start watching the anime i recommend you to watch the movie special : 
 
""The Episode Of East Blue"" 
 
-The Special Covers The First 44 Episodes of the anime 
The First 44 Episodes focus on the Main Character Luffy looking for members for his pirate crew. These episodes feature character arcs for the members he will recruit across 5 arcs. The arcs focus on their Character, Backstory and their motives so the audience can connect better with the characters. With this you could easily be hooked into watching the anime as was i 
 
If you find yourself interested in One Piece after watching the special and want to continue then continue on watching the next episode which is episode 45 and forward. However i have to say there are a lot of filler arc in one piece therefore the wiki is your best friend. All filler arcs are non cannon and just a waste of time in my opinion since it bring no plot driven trivia and just gives small jokes and in all honesty just by filler we can eliminate a few tens of episodes. 
 
And with that you should watch One Piece. Because if you don't you're missing out on a one of a kind show that make you experience all kinds of emotions.

    More character & plot development in a single arc than most anime series have throughout their entire run. Sometimes this series suffers a bit from the deadly ""Bleach-itis"" (a good show that is kept alive on a steady IV stream of filler arcs that serve very little to move the actual overall plot forward), but even then it's not TERRIBLE, and fortunately these arcs are not ALWAYS these monolithic full season filler arcs. But I would recommend finding a filler avoidance guide nonetheless.  
 
Boa is top-tier waifu material, not for her looks, but because she is hardcore ride or die, ready to take on the whole world for Luffy. Fuck you. Fight me.

    A lot of people seem to be hesitant about starting watching this anime which is completely understandable considering how many episodes it already has and how it isn't stopping anytime soon. I was like that too.  
But then when I one day started it I got so addicted I couldn't stop. The story is really basic and so vague the writer can literally add anything to it and it makes sense. The music is amazing and so are the characters. Some might say that the art style looks old which is kinda true but it changes a lot during the anime. 
If you truly like anime and have good taste, you will like this anime.

    One Piece sure was and is/always will be a great anime to go back to. The best part was all the journeys and the adventures they've had plus most of the battles were interesting. The Plot/Story was really planned out very well since one part led to another. Art was alright for an old anime and it improved throughout the years so that was a very nice thing to see. The Sound I really loved since both dub and sub was really well done plus the background sounds, really suited all the themes. Characters I think they did an outstanding job because all the characters were actually doing and filling in what their characters supposed to do also adds on the the enjoyment and entertainment. Overall I gave the anime a 9 because sure It had outstanding in most of the tasks but It lacked a little of the theme to wanting to watch more and more because of the long series.

    In the episodes I have seen so far, I have only really encountered two things that keep it from being perfect. The first being the art - it is far from being the best art I have seen in anime. However, for me this is easy to look past as the story and music is amazing. The other qualm that I have is the slow pacing. Because of this, I have not been able to continually watch the series. I watch an arc or two, then I put One Piece on hold. I watch other shorter anime until all the One Piece discussion and videos popping up on my Youtube feed rekindles my excitement to watch One Piece. Whenever I come back, I do not regret it.Each arc is thoroughly enjoyable with its character development and unique plot. The filler arcs in One Piece are some of the best if not the best filler arcs in anime. One Piece has made me cry more than any other anime - that may be because of the sheer amount of episodes, but that's not the point. Even if it takes you a decade, One Piece is definitely something worth watching. It has a bit of a rough start, but stick through it. Give it a shot, at least watch the first hundred episodes.

    The more I watch this anime… the more I hate it.  BUT I AM GOING TO TRY TO BE FAIR AND BALANCED. 
 
STORY:  The story an adventurous tale of a crew of ever expanding pirates and the cast constantly expands throughout the series.  The story is very character driven with lighthearted non-serious character moments.  The problem with this anime is that all the characters are terrible.  The characters have such contempt and disregard for each other… it makes me feel a range of apathy–hate for them.   
NOT A SPOILER…. But the ANIME SPOILS ITSELF:  The theme song actively will tell you when a character will end up joining the crew and ruins when an enemy will become an ally.  Nothing is left as a surprise.   
 
BATTLES:  They are usually quick and mindless themed around gaining new abilities or spotting obvious weaknesses. It is not done in the intelligent way that Naruto did.  Sometimes battles are so lazy and boring where an enemy, that previously beated Luffy, will go down in 1 hit instead of being something interesting.  The worst part of any action series is when the some of the fights are cut out of the show and impaled to have happened off-screen because that is lazy and happened a few too many times.  
 
HUMOR:  Basically the characters will all speak at the same time, saying the same thing in unison, as a joke… and it gets really old… really fast.  Other humor is derived from the one-dimensional character traits that feel so stereotypical and bland.  Luffy is stupid, random, and hungry so there I just gave you 75% of the jokes.  Hope you laughed… I did not. Everyone is in love with the red head female cast member who is selfish, greedy, and actively tries to hurts her own teammates. The liar in the group is very entertainingly funny.  The rest of the humor is heavy based in character moments that tend to get repetitive.  
 
SICK OF REUSED FOOTAGE:  The ending 1-3 mins of footage, from the previous episode, is often re-used at the beginning of the next episode so you will watch repeated footage constantly...  This gets worst and worst at the series goes on.  This is always an unacceptable practice.    
 
ART:  It has its own style is easy to appreciate and comes off as original, fresh, and cartoonishly lighthearted.  If the world was its own character it would be the best character of the series.  All the design chooses compliment the environment and story.  The outfit character’s ware is a reprobation of their one-dimensional personality and it works.  
 
CHARACTER:  The characters are mindless stereotypes that have no depth until the story randomly demands it and then quickly forgets it.  Luffy, as a main character is so dumb that it makes me hate this entire anime. Luffy is so one-dimential: gluttioness (hungry all the time so the humor falls flat), oblivious to the obvious, unintelligent (very gullible) and is someone I could never respect as a leader.  Luffy makes so many reckless mistakes it is hard to respect his character. The thing I hate the most about the anime is that Luffy will randomly take illogical counterintuitive actions like quitting in the middle of journey so he can give a speech that is supposed to come off as pensive/thoughtful but feels forced and out of place whenever these moments arrive.  It is like the writer is trying to give depth to characters by making them act out of character and it does not really work.  Luffy is the make OR break character you either LOVE him OR HATE him with no grey area.   
 
 
MUSIC:  Every sound fits the tone and nothing it out of place OR got too annoying.    
 
OVERALL: 
OVERALL: YOU WILL LIKE THIS IF:  You want something thoughtlessly light-hearted, episodically adventurous, like cartoon pirates with hearts of gold, OR enjoy the anime fool tropes.

    I am actually a hard-core Fairy Tail fan and it never occurred to me I should start watching other shounens until they stopped the anime for Fairy Tail. I've been hearing alot of good reccomandations for One Piece and so I decided to give it a whirl.  
 Story is 9, because there is not one moment you aren't on the edge of your seat or laughing like crazy. There are some filler episodes but, not too many to be irritating. 
 Art is very good. It's classic shounen style and doesn't make all the characters perfect or powerful. In a sense it's sort of realistic. But, there are times where the art can get very wierd like, sometimes Sanji's hair is flipped right, and sometimes left.  
 The sound is very high-quality and improves the watching experience by hundered-fold.  
 Character is WONDERFUL. There's alot of character devolopment yet, they always surprise you. I'm only down to 210 out of 621 episodes and I hear there are more crew members coming up and only makes me more excited to watch this show. 
 I enjoy this anime very much so far, and anyone who likes shounen anime will fall head over heels for this one.

    I believe One Piece is one of the few longest running anime since 1999. If my memory serves me correctly, I've only seen it a few times back in 2002 or 2003 in a channel in one of my country’s network, but I only started watching it seriously in original version back in 2009. Despite that, I am proud to say that I am a huge fan. 
 
About the STORY 
Story is very much original with different kinds of devil fruits users, Sky Island, Fishman Island, almost immortal Four Emperors, and lots of interesting yet weird people and animals in every island. Plot is packed with tons of adventure and actions at the same time you’ll laugh her hearts out. In every arc comes with the arrivals of new “NAKAMA” and new enemies which make it much more exciting because you know it will mean another marvelous adventure for the “MUGIWARA CREW”. Despite that, the main storyline is intact. One of the strongest points of this series is the seemingly endless adventure in every arc. Perhaps this series is the most adventure packed in the history of anime. You’ll experience not only adventure and laughter but at the same time you’ll experience a lot of drama not only with the main characters but also with supporting and recurring characters.  Oh! Did I mention how hilarious some of the characters are? Most especially Luffy, Chopper and Usopp. You will laugh your hearts out when watching these guys. The only flaw of One Piece, if I may add, is the obvious fact that it’s been running for so long but lots of questions are still not answered like what kind of person is Monkey D. Dragon? Who the hell are Kaido and Big Mam of the four emperors? What the hell is the so called One Piece? What happened in the “Void History” 900 years ago? Why the hell the revolutionaries still not making a move? I believe having lots of unnecessary side stories makes the story of One Piece run on a slow pace. Because of that, there are too much unwanted episodes. There are so much side stories that have no relation with the main storyline. I guess that’s one of the reasons why the series has been running for so long. It’s been more than a decade and it feels like the story is still not getting any closer with the main plot. But then again, I guess the whole point of the story is not the destination which is the place where they can find ONE PIECE but rather the whole journey towards it and the adventures that comes with it. 
 
About the CHARACTERS 
This series has been one of the longest running series so it is granted that there are a huge number of characters. Each of the main and supporting characters are very interesting, you would want more of them in the coming episodes. Because there is a wide range of characters to choose from and enough time to explore their backgrounds considering the series has been running for more than a decade now you won’t get tired with the different characters. I am personally interested with the real story behind the revolutionaries most importantly because it is led by Luffy’s father. But what’s the most interesting and strongest point of the series are the whole crew characters. You will witness how Luffy magnificently managed to persuade each of them despite having different objectives and goal on why they join the crew. It is amazing how every member manages to have teamwork despite their different individuality and of course, how so hilarious that they still support, trust, and follow their captain despite Luffy being weird and sometimes can be an idiot. And to add to that, every member has significant role on the ship and has interesting skills and abilities. You just have to see yourself how magnificent the whole crew when they do their fight scenes. Whenever you see them together led by Luffy, you just feel the coolness of their whole group. They are hilarious, strong, kind, and extremely likeable characters. I believe almost all of them are some of the most famous characters of all time. Not only that, you will feel proud how they’ve gotten so strong for this past decade. It’s like watching your child grow up.  
 
About MONKEY D. LUFFY 
The main protagonist, Luffy, is the number one character on my hundred best anime character lists. He is so strong not only physically but mentally and emotionally which shows how not only his friends but even his enemies are amaze about him. Like what Mihawk said, that one by one Luffy turns the people around him into his allies which is why that more than anyone else sailing the seas Luffy possesses the most terrifying power.  Not even realizing how a great man he is, that even the great Whitebeard, one of the emperor Shanks, the vice-captain Rayleigh, and even the enemies respects him, you will see how level-headed and dense Luffy can be. Though he can be so weird and stupid at times, which is one of the reasons why he is a lot more amazing and interesting than any other characters in any anime; you can still feel the sense of authority from him that really shows his capability as a captain. Funny that he can be so innocent yet so terrifyingly powerful. He personally picks out all his crewmates. He knows very well that there are things the even he can’t do, that’s why he trusts and have a strong faith towards his crewmates. Even if he’s very kind and most of the times acting like an idiot, he knows when to be strong and hard towards his crewmates because he carry the burden of being the captain and so he does important and harsh decisions in serious situations which make him a very effective leader. He doesn’t even need some monstrous supernatural energy or fictional magic to power-up. All he needs is the most basic for every living thing in the world, “FOOD” and he’s ready for some terrifying fight to the death. And to add, he doesn’t even looked like your typical action heroic type guy who have this certain coolness aura because of his outfit. My goodness, he’s just wearing a worn-out short, simple top, and plain slippers. I’ve never seen such plain looking protagonist in the hundred animes I’ve watched which I strongly believe the very reason why he’s the rarest male protagonist out there. Because of his weird antics, you wouldn’t even think how cool and amazing he is. And that makes him very original and most interesting character not only among the protagonist of all time but among all the characters in the anime world. I also love how much simple-minded he is and leave things to chances. I’ve been watching this series for so many years and my view about him never changed. In fact, every year I would find myself falling in love with his character more and more. I strongly believe that he’s the most amazing character ever made in the history of manga and anime. 
 
About the ANIMATION 
It may not have the best of the animation out there but still it is made amazingly in its own way. After so many years you can see its growth and you will realize that the animation is at best. The seiyus are also so amazing. They are well-picked and match perfectly with the characters. Most especially Luffy. I was even in shocked when I found out that his seiyu is actually a woman which makes her so talented. 
 
It’s been a long review; after all, the series has been running for more than a decade now. It would be a sin not to say all the pent up ideas, opinions, and comments. 
 
Be captivated with the amazing sleepyhead swordsman and almost like a vice-captain ZORO, the smart and greedy navigator NAMI, the hilarious and liar sharpshooter USOPP, the womanizer cook SANJI, the cute and scared cat doctor CHOPPER, the elegant and smart archeologists ROBIN, the hentai and cyborg shipwright FRANKY, the weird and funny musician BROOK, and of course, the hilarious, simpleminded, adventurous, weird, chivalrous, and absolutely cool captain MONKEY D. LUFFY. If you want to meet the most magnificent character ever in the history of animes then watch this. I won’t be exaggerating if I say that you will miss a great deal of your life if you won’t be hooked in this series. For so many years, I’ve been dying to see if Luffy can really be the “PIRATE KING”!

    A Great new take on pirates 
 
 
Story >>> 
 
The story of this anime is what really amazes me , the final objective is to become the pirate king that may leave you to think this will be the same old same old like beating pirate crews etc but if you think like that then you have another thing coming as the story of One Piece is deep & the focus on each character & their story is good. 
 
 
Animation >>> 
 
The animation is good & gives a really nice action adventure feel to the series , due to the art style used it may lack a bit of seriousness at times that you would get in many anime with dark style of animation like one seen in Full Metal Alchemist , but this was the best style for the series & i can't see any other style of animation working well for the series 
 
 
Sound >>> 
 
I Love the sound in One Piece , especially the specific themes that build you up for the moment , like the Overtaken theme that lead you up to big fights & Run Away theme when Luffy manages to escape from the enemy swiftly 
 
 
Characters >>> 
 
Not all anime show importance of each person no matter how lame you think he may be , One Piece Assigns roles to each characters who also have their dreams or ambitions to fulfill as their story progresses , even the minor characters that you think will go away in some time will have a major part to play in the story , you will like even those weird looking characters & be touched emotionally if something bad happens to them 
 
 
Enjoyment >>> 
 
 
I Really enjoyed watching this anime so much that at times i think man how awesome it would be if i was was alive back a few centuries ago & roam the sea with my friends instead of robbing people , this new take on pirates is simply awesome 
 
 
Final Verdict >>> 
 
This anime series is what makes your anime experience complete you simply can't miss this series.

    One Piece. Where do I even begin? 
 
I have finally caught up with One Piece to where it’s currently airing on TV. In the past three or so months I spent an average of 6.6 episodes per day watching One Piece, from episode 11 to episode 767, not counting filler. 
 
I will lay out this review first by themes, then by other aspects. 
 
JUSTICE. There are two main forces of power in this world created by Eiichiro Oda, the Marines and the pirates. The Marines purport to uphold justice, even wearing the word on the back of their cloaks. They view the pirates as criminals just for being pirates, as if being a pirate as of itself is wrong. Much of the conflict in One Piece (OP) is generated by the Marines’ going after pirates. Thus the renowned pirates are given bounties, the higher meaning the more wanted (and thus the more powerful). Behind the Marines is the World Government (WG). As you watch more and more story arcs, you begin to realize that much of the corruption present on each island is allowed by the WG; thus, each time the Straw Hats encounter an island’s dark history and events behind the curtain, it’s a microcosm for the corruption of the world as a whole, overseen by the WG. This is not justice, whatever ideal the Marines aggrandize -- a better form of “justice” is in fact what the Straw Hats enact. Each time the Straw Hats land, they can’t help but assist the island’s inhabitants, and make gratified friends along the way; the Straw Hats are the true enforcers of justice in OP. They completely flip the stereotypical idea of the pirate, the pillager and looter and killer; to be a pirate is simply to enjoy adventure to the fullest. 
 
NAKAMA. The Japanese word for friend, comrade, compatriot, etc. No other anime uses this word as much as OP, no other character as much as Luffy. In OP, it’s used to mean friend, yes, but for those dear to Luffy like his crew, it means something closer than family. We humans are social animals and thrive on interpersonal interaction and attachment, whether familial or of friendship or romantic; thus we can empathize with the strong ties of loyalty in the Straw Hat crew as they fight various enemies together. Luffy cares deeply for his fellow Straw Hats; he cannot bear the notion of someone leaving the crew. The moments when he cries, like really cries with water flooding out of his eyes, are rare in OP; such moments only occur when Luffy loses someone close to him or otherwise experiences deep emotion related to friendship. Another, lesser, word for friend is tomodachi, which is also used often but just for friend as we know the word; not in the strong, pure sense that we know as nakama. This theme, as you may know, is also prevalent in Fairy Tail, whose guilds are like pirate crews in OP. Although Fairy Tail’s strong bonds of loyalty and friendship are true, they cannot surpass those in OP. I cried so much watching OP. Watching OP, I look at my circle of friends and realize that there are few, if any, I can call nakama. Sad, isn’t it. 
 
A SAD STORY. Whenever a new Straw Hat joins the crew, his/her backstory is revealed; and man, they’re all sad and heart-rending. These characters! Some may say that the Straw Hats don’t undergo major character development throughout the story; but imagine the Straw Hats without their special quirks and you’d miss it. It’s inherent to OP and ultimately necessary. Even though they may do the same peculiar things over and over again, it’s never boring to see again. 
 
THE ONE PIECE. The plot of OP in short is Luffy’s journey to find the One Piece, a treasure left behind by the former king of the pirates, Gol D. Roger, who announced such a thing at his execution. Luffy’s typical introduction at the start of the series goes something like “I’m Monkey D. Luffy and I want to become the king of the pirates.” Those who hear just laugh, for such an idea is absurd, because there are SO MANY incredibly powerful pirates out there and the seas are so expansive and you’d basically have to become the top pirate to achieve something like that. Luffy has this dream, and he’s willing to die fighting for it because at least he tried. Watching OP is so inspiring to me, with my own unrealistic dreams, to follow such dreams and fight for them. Not completely literally of course, but to work at it. A dream is only impossible if you give up. 
 
THE ADVENTURE. The plot sounds simple, doesn’t it? Monkey D. Luffy, a pirate sailing the seas to become the king of the pirates. Oh no. For the creators of worlds, there are few I call true masterminds, geniuses, who are in complete control of their worldbuilding and have done so much planning and creating to the point where you’re confused and intrigued all at once -- for fantasy I name George R. R. Martin and Steven Erikson; for anime I name Eiichiro Oda. In this immensely long series, 768 episodes to date, he brings back characters introduced hundreds, I mean literally hundreds, of episodes earlier; whenever the Straw Hats do something big and the news spreads around the world, you see friends and people from their respective pasts reading about them; over and over again he introduces new characters, with unique powers and strengths and quirks; he describes island after island after island. Pirates sail from the North, South, East and West Blue to the Grand Line, and from the Grand Line to the New World. Honestly, I don’t know how big the Earth in OP is. 
 
SHOUNEN. The levels of power are insane; as a shounen anime, OP is expected to have lots of fighting and lots of strong characters. I mean, looking back to how Luffy fought in East Blue and comparing it to how he can fight now, like, it’s freakin’ amazing, the power differential. That sense of awe and wonder when powerful characters are briefly shown on the screen, you know what I mean, or when they’re mentioned in conversation -- like when Laxus and Mystogan are first mentioned in Fairy Tail, or when you see the 13 court guard squad captains arrayed at table in Bleach, or the introduction of all the S-class heroes in One Punch Man, or… you get the idea. OP has this feeling hyped, jacked, on steroids, whatever, thrust to the skies and beyond. There are so many, and I repeat, so many, powerful pirates and Marines in OP. It’s crazy. This world that Oda has imagined and put to manga, I would go insane trying to remember everything. Which leads me to my next topic. 
 
DEVIL FRUITS. Now this is what makes OP especially awesome. There are these so-called “Devil Fruits” that are cursed because after you eat one, you can’t swim; when you go into water, your body is weakened and you eventually sink. The upside? Each Devil Fruit, and no two are the same, gives you one of three types of powers, I won’t describe them here because that’s not revealed all at the beginning of the anime, but the main Devil Fruit user is Luffy himself, who ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi (rubber-rubber fruit) and can stretch like rubber because he’s in essence a rubber man. And there are a lot more users in OP. Each fight between two Devil Fruit users is unique, because, as materials or elements or even concepts, some Devil Fruits are naturally stronger than others. No Devil Fruit is almighty, in other words. It’s like Avatar: The Last Airbender but exponentially exploded. Much more than merely fire, water, earth and air is in OP. Get ready for some creative fights. Now, the fight scenes in OP obviously aren’t as good as those in, say, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works; watching them is awesome not necessarily for the fighting quality, but more for what significance the fight’s outcome holds, for how the characters have gotten stronger, for how these guys can fight in the first place. There are, like, an infinite number of ways to fight in OP. Now. Practically all shounen anime has this thing for announcing fight moves with special names, like “Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu” in Naruto or “Fire Dragon’s Roar” in Fairy Tail or “Tensa Zangetsu” in Bleach, just to name a few. Some would point this out as a flaw in shounen; but I say no, imagine watching the anime fight scenes without the moves announced, and it’s vastly different. It’s necessary. Each technique is named, and thus exists. For something to exist, it has to be recognized; in short, given a name. Besides, when these characters fight, they worked on their various moves and abilities and thus have pride in proclaiming each technique when using it. 
 
INHERITED WILL. Nothing else to be said here; this is a crucial part of OP, but I can’t say too much about it here. 
 
GRADUAL REVELATION. Did I mention Oda was a genius? Another thing he does brilliantly is slowly, bit by bit, reveal more about Devil Fruits, the Grand Line, the history of the world, what the hell is even going on in his world. Even now, after 767 episodes, I honestly don’t know shit. I know some things, but not enough. All the more to look forward to in upcoming episodes! What’s more, the more you watch, the more of an overarching plot is shown; and the implications are huge. 
 
That being said, OP also has an amazing soundtrack. Of course tracks repeat for certain types of situations but the composer can only come up with so many different pieces for such a long anime. Very cinematic, reminiscent of film scores; OP has the most soundtrack music good enough to download onto my phone out of any anime I've seen. 
 
The animation may throw you off. It threw me off and was the biggest reason, that and the length of the show, for my not watching OP. I started episode 1 and it didn’t throw me off one bit. Compared to anime like Angel Beats! or Clannad or Code Geass, the character designs in OP are actually pretty realistic; goofy, but realistic. The original style of animation in OP has this gentle, touching quality to it. And it only gets better. Okay, it does get less three-dimensional and more clear-cut, but the clarity, the visual caliber, is another thing to look forward to when watching OP. Several times while on my OP journey I was eager to watch OP just for the improved animation. Comparing episode 1 to episode 767, I mean, damn. It’s changed so much. One thing I particularly like about OP is its many close shots of faces. So awesome. 
 
The story? It’s the best-planned, best-written, best-imagined story I’ve ever seen in anime. Once it finishes, and let’s hope Oda stays in good health, it will be deemed one of the best classics of any medium, I have no doubt about it. Each story arc is so complex and elaborate and detailed, they’re long but it’s realistic because there are so many factors in conflict so it takes time to resolve. 
 
Enjoyment? My first semester of my freshman year of college can be summed up by two words: ONE PIECE. 
 
My last words, my call to all anime viewers out there; no, to anybody in search of a reason to cry, to laugh, to be pumped up, to dream: 
 
Live, and fight for your dream; live, and be with your nakama. This world we live in may not be as romantic as that of One Piece, but it is beautiful just the same. Go into that romance dawn and sail your own adventure. 
 
What is your One Piece?

    So first I want to say that this is one of the biggest packages of just pure fun you can pick up and watch. Seriously it sucks you right in and you will really love the world and want to be a part of the Straw Hats I guarantee that.  
 
Story: 10 
It is a huge goal layered with a ton of interesting challenges, places, adventures, characters, and more along the way. This makes a really fun and exciting story as Luffy and his crew make their way to the One Piece as they grow and you see more about the world and learn more about the crew and their ongoing and strengthening connections they build with each other. Their world is captivating and just awesome.  
 
Art: 9  
Some people do not like the art. I agree halfway and here is why. I love the pre-newworld art. I think it is unique and goes with the theme this show has so well. The newworld art style I am not as big a fan of but its growing on me and I am really starting to like it as much as the old style. The art is great because it is different then your cliche anime art style.  
 
Sound: 9 
Great songs and that go great with the themes and fight scenes. You will be humming them whether you notice or not haha 
 
Character:10 
Some of the most likable and enjoyable characters ever are in this show. Luffy and Zoro alone already make the list of characters a 10 but then add the rest of the crew who all have great and back stories and you have some serious potential and it delivers! The show does a fantastic job of showing the teamwork and strong bonds the crew has which is an essential part of the show and the connections always build.  
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Like I said before. This show is pure fun. It also can be extremely serious and intense when it needs to be. You will get hooked on this show and love every second of it. The worst part of the show is when you catch up and go...wait only one episode a week...im going to die.. 
 
Overall:10 
Watch it just do it. It should be on every anime watchers list.

    Such a horrible fate One piece has to find himself being produced by Toei Animation studios.  
 
There is no doubt that one piece is awesome if we talk about the story. The universe is attracting, characters are lovable and it follows a certain logic that fit perfectly the shounen manga world, from this point of view you will definitly have a hard time finding a manga with such big and coherant world and at the same time light-hearted. So story 8/10.  
 
[IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH ONE PIECE PASS ONTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT HINT ABOUT THE STORY] 
The only problem that i could spot in the story is the recent developpement of 
Sanji,Usopp and Brook. The author has quite ignored sanji and brook, and make usopp a good for nothing, succeeding in enormous proportions because of his luck and not his will to become a great pirate. And that sacrifice of the character only for some gags that are not funny is in my point of view very absurd. If we were 5 Years in the past and you were telling me Usopp's storyline from the dressrosa Arc, i'm not sure if i would want to talk with you again...   
 
For the character developpement, i'm sadened that the author of the pillar of the shounen world (so children story) actually has the systematic tendency to over-sexualise the body of the women in his story. The binary vision of the pretty women with big boobs and a perfect waist in the opposite of the ugly women is really disturbing and can opress the lector. Because of these two point i gave 6/10 note for Characters. 
 
Soundtrack is awesome and voice characters too so : 8/10. 
 
When in the vast majority of anime adaptations the anime make the story even more interesting and pretty. One piece is the exact inverse case. From static plans being abused to bad drawings, bad and awfully long animations and a pacing utterly slow, the dynamics of fights is impacted negatively.  
It's because the studio has make the awfull choice to animate one chapter per episode, have you seen in an anime a character yelling 2 times in the same scene his attack's name, then you haven't seen one piece anime.  
Some scene are very far from being honest with the manga. So i put 1/10 for the Art.  
 
Overall, don't lose your time watching one piece anime, buy the books you'll definitly enjoy better the story. I put 1/10 Overall because i think 8/10 for this anime is defintely too much, i would put 4/10, but my opinion is that this anime does not represent the manga correctly. It's not for nothing that a project named ""One pace"" (Removing all sort of bad scene) exist for this series.

    Why this anime surprises me? I love the characters' moviment and voices, the musics are great at any moment that happen, making a climate very beautiful and exciting. The fillers which have in the anime (but not in the manga) are very funny and fun (although it's too slow), I really like them because there are so many interesting things to see (of course, there are another fillers which aren't so good, but it's worth watching, in my opinion.). I never skip the episodes, because there are something that may be relevant. 
 
 
But there are somethings in One Piece that I don't like the exaggerated fanservice and how the anime waste time with things unnecessery at one episode. As I am a girl, I think the One Piece's girls should be more exploited in your power and personality, and shouldn't be represented by big breasts and thin waist, that is disproportionate. 
 
 
That's my opinion about the anime, I really prefer the manga. But see the anime too, as I said, it's worth watching by the characters' voices and the musics, the moments are more impressives when you're watching. One Piece has very lessons to learn and the history is very good, if you read or watch, I'm sure you will find epic moments.

    So, Today I sat down and watched a good 20-30 episodes of One Piece.  One Piece, for me has been an anime that I'd always sit down and watch every *now and then*, but because of its slow start it was a show that I thought of as ""nothing special"".   
 
Today, on the other hand, after I experienced the back story's of Sanji (The Chef), Zoro (The Pirate Hunter), and Nami (The Navigator) I realized that this may indeed be a shounen, it's silly, outrageous and a great laugh, but at the same time it's a maturely themed show; especially considering the Nami arc. 
 
This is just but a preliminary review, I'm currently on episode 53/461, and I'm enjoying every waking minute of it.  The OP and ED themes (The introduction/Closing) are fantastic.  Character wise there's a great balance of archetypes; the only one of which I really find annoying is Usopp. 
 
The sound is generally a good mix of classical to highlight and emphasize critical moments, rising action, climaxes and such, it's very subtle, but well thought out.  Character development is great and I hope it will keep getting better.  The art work is simple but it brings out enough in terms of persona that I rated it quite decently.  
 
Overall, this anime ranks as my favorite, most enjoyable anime so far (and I've watched a lot of anime!) It's just a wacky, zany adventure that you really don't want to miss out on.  I couldn't believe that the story was able to make me hate and detest certain characters and so on & so forth. Amazing Show.

    (Caution: you don't have to read my foreword unless you want to, the review according to the rating starts at the ''CHRONOLOGICAL RATING:'' title) 
 
Woah! That is certainly my expression through watching the whole anime, and yet it has not ended! I am actually not sure wether I should rate it as superior or inferior to other animes. That is why I decided to make a review on my very personal level.  
 
I remember when I saw one of my tight friends in high school watching One Piece at my place (in fact this was before I even watched any animes). However I also got this flashback of my pathetic old self just sitting there in the chair next to him thinking ''WTF is this bullsh*t'' Y'know the one kind that hasn't even tried anime in his/her whole life - which means I WAS an outsider afterall, so that being said I'm definitely ready to give creds to my thankable old friend who watched One Piece while I was being stubborn.. 
 
Enough of the history about me, since it's... ...lets say ''half irrelevant'' to the review. 
 
One piece is the kind of anime not to be taken lightly. Do not understand me though, it's not a negative nor a positive statement, it's just me speaking for a more neutral side. I just need to point out that there is no such thing as ''this is the anime you should watch for the first one'' neither ''this is NOT the anime you should watch for the first time'' - as it depends highly on your own choice of categorizing. 
 
But as I'm speaking for myself, this anime had to bring down much of my time so I can recommend to plan a little better, since 'my' planning along with the animes timeline went to hell.  So to simplify: One Piece is NOT beneficial if you don't have the time to watch it... well beneficial might be the wrong word but I hope you'll understand my way of thinking. 
 
CHRONOLOGICAL RATING: 
 
Story: 9 (Great) 
- The story made me cry several times, mostly because of the amazing family-history of the main character: Luffy, but also because you will go through all of his crew while it's holding a really epic surrounding which is also timing to the enjoyment. However I still need to point out that this might not happen to those who prefer the story background and everything to be shorter. 
 
Art: 7 (Good) 
- In the beginning I was almost instantly convinced that the draw quality wasn't the ace of this anime (which many anime- and manga companies choose to have). But I still need to say ''no shit'' because I realized soon enough that One Piece airing date was kind of old - which by the way gave me a really negative feeling in the start... ...Though that feeling was soon about to be erased! I probably gave it 100 episodes and the art was shining already. Because the looks didn't matter anymore - which certainly makes me want to say ''Don't judge the book by it's cover''. As I get pretty long into the anime I get to the point where the art suddenly gets even better! I'm sure all of you know the pissed-off badass'' kind of face'' of a person who is very angry yet doesn't say a word, y'know the ''state of concentration''. Well I'm glad to bring you good news because One Piece definitely has it, which is also timed according to good moments to do so (well some moments may be for the sake of comedy, but even that has it's point). So potentially speaking, the art to me is not even worth being on the rating-table because it does not even matter, as I said do not judge it by the cover because then you will most likely quit after a few minutes. Give it some time. 
 
Sound: 8 (Very Good) 
- Haha, one thing that for some weird reason got me was that the voice actor for the main character is a woman and not a boy. Do not let this concern you because I definitely wouldn't believe it until I saw it officially on myanimeist. No but seriously the voice acting is very good and specially the main characters in the anime(Luffys and his crew). As for the opening- and ending songs: 7 in my opinion, after hearing it in several episodes. It even approved the anime a bit and it made it more ''cosy''. 
 
Character: 8 (Very Good) 
- As almost being said in the art section - the characters definitely are amazing, epic, wild and yet even lovely for some weird reason. Luffy the main character of the series is bringing the best outcome of all of them, he has this really amazing and ''I don't give a fuck about superiors'' aura. I mean he can pretty much stand up to god with his expression that will make most of the supporting characters laugh! And that is also what makes his nakamas(crew) even more enjoyable, because he influences them too eventually. He will appear as dumb and retarded as well, but in the end that's just nothing compared to his badass expression when he puts up a fight among the pirates! Which will also make you smile, because his enemies or rivals will definitely first have the kind of expression ''This kid is stupid''. But as I said in the end, Luffy doesn't give a shit, he and his nakamas has this aura among them selves that says ''I've already decided to kick your ass''. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 6 & 8 (Fair and Good) 
- The enjoyment rating may come as a kind of ''Plot Twist'' in this review but to me just a single number is not a persons true feeling. ''Fair'' it says. But here is where I come in and say that One Piece still has it's up and downs. Because I gave it a lot of time, which by the way destroyed my sleep and eventually made me exhausted. Sure you can either disagree or agree with me, but let me just say it: One Piece truly was great, but at some point in this exhausted area I had... ...I truly wanted to skip a few episodes. So here is a lesson when watching One Piece: Whatever you decide, think about it. Do not force your sleep down to 6 pm. Once I was craving for sleep, the day after was like a hangover! (Only a suggestion though) If you decide to watch One Piece and love it to the end, I guess you were proving me wrong.

    One piece is an anime series about a Pirate named Luffy and his journey to try and become the King of Pirates. Along the way he and his crew get into a lot of amazing adventures, like trying to save a kingdom from a criminal organisation, Going to an island in the sky, and many more! 
 
People who hate on One Piece are pretty much the average ""Anime Hipsters"" you'll find on this site. A lot of people say the anime has gotten worse after the time skip, but honestly i'm still loving it, and if you're not bored of a series 550 episodes in then it deserves a 10/10 in my opinion. I definitely recommend this series to anyone looking for an anime with a lot of episodes. However, it does get slow at times, so if you're impatient it might not be for you as there are almost 1000 episodes.

    Best thing I ever watch/read/seen in my life. And trust me I've seen a lot from Indian cinema to Hollywood, but there's nothing as legendary as One Piece. It is the most special thing in my life. Obviously, the manga is on a whole new level, but the anime adaptation of the greatest comic book of all time does justice to the manga. Only one reason is enough to say that the anime does justice to the manga and it is the Japanese  voice cast. They give life to the characters.  
Art: Oda's art, duh. But the animation gets a little mediocre after time skip but that shouldn't worry you if you're a One Piece. 9/10 
Story: The greatest story mankind has ever come up with. 10/10 
Sound: Good choice and one of the most iconic Shonen music + the voice cast. 10/10 
Character: Every character is close to my heart, every One Piece fan at this situation should be biased, cause they are the greatest fictional characters. 10/10 
Enjoyment: The greatest form of entertainment a living creature can ever witness. One Piece is a true treasure. 10/10 
Overall: The greatest anime of all time, the best fictional universe of all time, the most beautiful treasure.  
Thank you, Oda sensei.

    Awesome and long. Long enough to take up your whole summer if you start from the start but tasteful enough to make it worth it. If the sheer number of episodes scare you from starting to watch this anime then don't worry, if you skip the intro theme song and recap each episode can be done in 15-20 mins. this anime is all about a character named Luffy who starts of as a weak nobody gathering friends along the way who help him achieve his dream while trying to accomplish their personal goals. The character development for each and every character doesn't seem to stop which is awesome for such a long anime and even some of the enemies and acquaintances keep getting stronger (not spoiling much :P). The anime is expected to be roughly 1200 episodes long and Luffy has already gone through a lot up till now but surely the bigger and more badass stories are yet to come.

    This is definitely one of the best anime`s out there. Personally it`s my second favorite anime under Naruto, there are alot of episodes to this but it really pays off. It does start off quite slow so you need to give it some time. I recommend watching this casually for the first 100 episodes or so. It``s not something you can binge right away, first you get attatched to the characters and the story then it really picks up. You`ll eat the episodes up like candy. 
 
Story:  
The overall story to this is quite good. At first it may not seem too great but trust me they really tie everything in quite well. It mostly feels like a big adventure, Luffy sailing around the sea gaining allies and defeating enemies.  
 
Art: 
This anime did start a long time ago so once you first start this it will be a bit outdated. But as you progress throught the episodes you will see a definite increase int he quality. 
 
Sound:  
The sound in this is nothing special, the voice actors are quite good and the intros aren`t bad but they arent the best. 
 
characters: 
The best part about this anime are all of the characters you meet. Luffy picks up crewmates along his journey and you really grow attacched to all of them. It`s quite fun to watch all of his friends grow stronger and closer alongside Luffy through their adventures. 
 
Overall: 
I would highly recommend this anime to anyone. It has a little bit of everything. It can be slow at times but it`ll usually make up for that with epic moments. It also has some of the best comedy in any anime. Take your time and enjoy it.

    Story 
For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. 
 
Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. 
 
Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. 
 
This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? 
 
The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. 
 
With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. 
 
With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. 
 
 
Animation 
Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. 
 
The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. 
 
Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. 
 
 
Sound 
Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. 
 
Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). 
 
 
Characters 
Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. 
 
The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). 
 
However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. 
 
Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. 
 
My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. 
 
 
Overall 
Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time where One Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. 
 
However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.

    I'll say it, this show is amazing, it is a deep telling of boy who wants to be free. One Piece sets up a huge and entertaining world with endless possibilities. Luffy is searching for the one piece, he gathers together and sets out to the grand line. 
 
Story:  I'm not going to lie, the story has a very basic cycle openly but it has a main story building in the background. The story typically plays out with Luffy arriving at an island, the people are friendly but something is wrong. the person controlling the island is evil and must be stopped. Luffy has no reason to help but he gets so pissed of at whatever is wrong that he makes a promise to a member of the island (typically a girl) that he will kick the villians ass. The very often 2D villain is evil for evils sake gets beaten off as Luffys crew in order of importance defeats his underlings. After this they have a party and leave. this cycle is repeated with something little being added to the overall story every arc, This building up to a dramamtic ending.  
 
Art: I don't have to say much about this, its horrible but you will get used to it.  
 
Sound: the soundtrack is awesome, I listen to the individual tracks all the time, adds something to every scene. 
 
Character: Luffy is a life loving badass, undereducated, simple minded, strong moraled and willed pirate. He sets his mind to something and does it, he has no fear which builds into his badass nature. His character changes after a serious event before a 2 year time skip and he developes a sense of what its like to be scared and powerless. However with how good Luffy is, most of his crew is 2D. With the exception of Roronoa Zoro, he's first mate and swordsmen.  
 
Enjoyment:  For me their is nothing more important then enjoyment in a show. I can say without a doubt you will enjoy this show, it is a feel good joy ride that always leaves you with a smile. it sets up a grand scale world with many lovable characters.  
 
Overall: This show is exciting, engaging and allows you to leave the world and engulf yourself in a fantasy world like no other. I'm sure anyone who watches this will atleast leave with a smile, it is wonderful.

    Writing a review on One Piece is very difficult. 
With over 740 episodes and counting it is one of the biggest shows ever. It is only logical that there is a wide range of quality to be seen here.  
Some of the story arcs are genius (Enie's Lobby) while others should have been left out because they are either way too long (i'm looking at you thriller bark) or simply not good.  
 
Unlike any other anime, this one got me hooked for more than 200 episodes. I just couldn't stop watching which resulted in heavy binge-watching sessions which cut out my social life for more than a weak. How did One Piece do that? First of all, the characters. The characters are One Piece's biggest strength and probably the reason why it is that popular. They are unique, they are funny and remain interesting. While Ruffy is our main character here, One Piece gives his sidekicks way more love than any other anime series. Each of them has a heart-breaking past of his own, while each of them managed to get to a point in his life where he/she found his or her strength again.  
Second the humor. While some of the jokes in the series become kind of dull because they get repeated over and over again, some of them become running gags that work absolutely well. Nothing here is taken too seriously which gives Oda and his team many opportunities to surprise with new creative ideas. 
Of course this creativity get's visibly exhausted at some points in the series. It is just too long to be sustained over presumably 1200 episodes that they will produce until we finally know what the One Piece really is in the first place. Many of these episodes especially the fighting scenes are stretching among 50 to 70 episodes while not much happens in each single episode.  
 
From all the long-term animes it is probably the best and definetly surpasses it's competitor Naruto in creativity, humor and especially when it comes to characters. 
If you don't like animes that are completed way too soon, One Piece gives you the opportunity to fall in love with a bunch of characters who will probably accompany you for many years.

    One Piece, the current best selling manga series of all time and in my opinion ""The greatest shonen series to date"". Controversial this statement may be, but here me out, this review is my opinion on the one piece franchise, if you don't agree with me opinion then  feel free to message me explaining why. 
 
Story: 
One Piece's story is overall pretty simple, Monkey D. Luffy (Main Character) wants to become the pirate king, in order to do that he needs to find the One Piece, the greatest treasure known to man that was left behind by the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger. At the beginning of the series Luffy sets out on an adventure to do just that and along the way form a pirate crew with the best members he can possibly find. The story of One Piece, along with the characters are what I believe to be the series strong points and why I think it is the best shonen series. The One Piece world is the biggest, most interesting and immersive world in anime that I can think of, you have desert islands, snow islands, women only islands, no matter where luffy ends up going you are always in for something new, fresh and interesting. That is exactly why One Piece stands above the other series such as Naruto & Bleach, it is always coming up with new ways to interest the viewer and keep them hooked.  
 
Characters: 
One Piece's characters in short, are some of the most developed and interesting characters in anime, every member of luffy's crew has had multiple episodes/chapters of backstory, explaining how they became who they are. This allows them to develop into new, stronger people and you get to watch that happen. Now don't get me wrong, some of the side characters don't get as much development as the straw hat pirates but there are so many characters in one piece that giving them all backstory would be nearly impossible. Another positive to One Piece characters is that each of them has a completely different personality, so there is bound to be a character that you really like and can relate to.  
 
Soundtrack: 
Not much I can really say about the soundtrack other than its pretty amazing, the soundtrack is full of orchestrated songs that will give you goosebumps, each song goes extremely well with whatever is happen. A pumped up song when luffy is fighting, to a calm and chilled song when something sad is about to happen, there is something for everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 
This depends on the viewer, some people don't like the over the top fighting, I however think that's what makes the show fun and its one of my favorite parts about One Piece. Everyone has a different opinion on the show, some hate it, some love it, I think however that everyone can at least appreciate the show for what it is, entertainment.   
 
Overall: 
One Piece is a very well written, very funny and enjoyable shonen series that everyone who watches anime can at least appreciate, if you are thinking about watching or reading the series go ahead, If you make it 50 episodes in you will be hooked. Its the number 1 selling manga of all time for a reason!! :)

    One Piece is The Greatest Shonen Anime/Manga of all time. 
 
It features a grand adventure full of colourful and developed characters, each with their own unique goals and dreams. The narrative is extremely well-paced and intriguing with great writing and presentation; the Animation and Music are both incredibly top-notch. They give each Arc/Location it's own style of atmosphere which makes the series very innovative. This coincides with the genius storytelling that balances badass action scenes and hilarious comedic moments. One Piece is also a very memorable show with gorgeous imagery and designs. An example of this brilliance is in the backstory for the Punk Hazard Arc where a character with a Fire-type ability battles an Ice-type character for a long time in one location, an island. This results in a contrast of settings and characters because half the island is covered in Ice while the other half is engulfed by Fire, so different variations and ideas are explored in just one Arc! 
 
Finally, the series just knows how to have fun and not be overly-dramatic like many other Animes. This in turn, makes the few brilliant dramatic episodes all the more impactful! 
 
One Piece is a True Classic.

    One piece is one of the best anime I have seen. First of all its plot is huge and outstanding. Oda-san has created a whole world for this anime. In addition one piece's soundtracks are epic. Moreover the characters are well-designed. Besides this the voice actors are well-picked and they're doing a great job. Lastly  the main reason I rate one piece as one of the best anime is that it includes many funny moments but it also contains epic fighting scenes, too.

    This is the 3rd anime i watched when i started. 
I found it on a youtube trailer ,with the 4kids dub. 
the art style is great and the story itself isn't that bad are simple i know. 
but does that matter, if its easy too understand. 
 
Now the background story's! 
no spoilers just WOW! 
 
But still the 4kids dub damn what where they thinking? 
leave it by the Pokemon series. they where good. 
But what the hell did those voice actors do when they recorded the voices? 
 
FUNImation the brand that was also on School rumble (first full anime series i've seen) so i thought hey they started dubbing One Piece. why not try streaming 2 eps. 
 
next day i orderd the first two box sets xD 
The humor and action scenes are so well worked out. 
no more lemonade shit when somebody dies, real blood!! 
 
voice overs are the best with colleen clinkenbeard as luffy and  sonny strait as ussop, nami luci christian and offcourse Roa noa Zorro as Chistpher R Sabat. 
 
Amazing!

    This is a positive review. I am going to express my spite for many parts of the show in a brutally honest way, but overall I am arguing that this is a beautifully rare specimen of the world. 
 
The FLAWS of One Piece: 
 
1) It is an epic, and it is dragging us around. It is too long and slow, and they want it that way: to keep us watching for 10 to 15 more years. (I personally think that the series could have had an open-ended finale at the Summit War) 
 
2) It's a Shounen. We are all familiar with the flaws here, some weird race to ""who is the most powerful in the universe"", nonsensical arguments about the rankings of strength, Highlander ""there can only be one"" sentiments, shitty intro music, etc. What really irks me is that this has really gotten worse over time. The first few seasons are actually guilt free these problems. During the Skypiea saga Oda really signs the lease on a Shounen when enemy attacks have DBZ sound effects, and the action scenes are outsourced to fight scene specialists that botch Luffy's facial expressions (which are a highlight for me). 
 
3) It's repetitive: as said in other reviews, every country they visit has more or less the same dilemma: evil ruler, Luffy kicks their ass. Except it takes 100 episodes. Every female character is mostly boobs, supporting characters have weird laughs, Luffy protects his nakama, and anyone who sees Luffy fight believes he will become pirate king, which is meant to keep the drug-addicted super fan on the edge of their seat for another 15 years thinking ""OH MAN IS HE REALLY GONNA DO IT??"" 
 
THE GOOD PARTS OF ONE PIECE THAT MAKE THESE THINGS FORGIVABLE 
 
1) It's really fucking original and creative. On one end, the Shounen aspects seem unoriginal. But I don't think we can overlook the fact that the main character is a happy-go-lucky adopted straw-hat rubber-man, and he is but one of the hundreds of amazingly interesting characters. I haven't seen any other anime that unleashes the author's insane ideas as much as One Piece. In terms of content, this show is definitely one of the most unique I have come across.  
 
2) The dramatic side is actually really interesting. Earlier I mentioned a shift in the show during the Skypiea saga. While I dislike much of the production quality that changed at this time, this saga added an additional layer to the show that I think becomes one of the reasons that keeps us watching. While each individual saga is predictable (mean ruler, Luffy beats them up, nobody dies), the overarching story has multiple levels of intrigue, and the length of the show is actually effectively utilized to create a multi-dimensional story arc. 
 
3) The MOST important: the universe... it's amazing. The characters, the geography, the islands, everything. Since the show is so slow, I almost want to recommend the manga, but truthfully it's fun to see these ideas come to life with color, movement, and sound. While I have mostly talked about suspense, I would here like to say that One Piece is good because it is FUN. Despite the repetition, I think it's amazing to see Oda/Luffy/Roger's idea of what a pirate is: someone who sets sail in search of adventure. With that premise in mind, Oda took aspects of Earth and made them cartoony, dangerous, and exciting for Luffy to encounter throughout his journey. This craving of adventure sets an optimistic tone for the whole series, and while it is often cliche and predictable, that doesn't depreciate from my liking of the Strawhat pirate crew when they are already such a unique hodgepodge of individuals. I truly believe that buried in this crazy story, are Oda's opinions about how people should genuinely treat their human position. 
 
Any hesitance to watch the show due to the fact that its is already almost 800 episodes long is totally valid. But if you are capable of diving into a lengthy series, and are making the decision betweens epic sagas, I think that One Piece is the king (yeahyeah, funny) of this genre.

    Let me say this right now: One Piece will forever be my favorite series. I have faith that Eiichiro Oda will continue to write with the amazing skill that he has and will not let it falter like the writers of Naruto and Bleach did toward the end.  
 
But but BUT there's two big reasons that I say series rather than anime. In truth, I follow the manga far more closely than the anime itself. There are two reasons for this: the filler and the animation budget. As a long time One Piece fan, I'm sure that many of you understand what I'm referring to. But to those who are jumping into the series this late (good luck binge watching that, kids) I shall explain the faults of the anime. 
 
Let's start off with the big one: animation. Now, when I say animation I'm not talking about art style. I think Oda's art style is unique and he delivers it very well. No, I'm referring to the amount  of crappy stills put into a fight scene. The amount of quality that fails as the series progressed. Up until the Whitebeard War arc (which you could say is currently the halfway point of the series) the animation had its own charm. It wasn't overly flashy but it certainly got the job done and both the fight scenes and the relaxed scenes looked fairly decent. But once the New World hit, something happened to the budget of the animation, as many of the scenes lacked a lot of detail and its disheartening to see. Now, recently, the animation has started to hike back up. I don't know how long this will last or if it will be just for these few scenes in between the big climax, but time will tell on that.  
 
Onto the second problem: the filler. Now, unlike Naruto and Bleach, One Piece's filler isn't done through seasons of standalone arcs. There's only a few of those throughout the series and generally don't last that long in the first place. The filler, much like the animation slope, came later in the series, and worked its way in between episodes. What Toei does is instead of making arcs to distance themselves from catching up to the manga or just taking a few months break, they instead will expand on one scene very terribly and ruin the flow that Oda put forward. Something that lasted one or two panels in the manga will last close to ten minutes in the anime. This might not be such a problem if Toei didn't make the expanded scenes so ugly looking or interesting. Instead you can just feel the laziness of the scene. 
 
With those complaints out of the way, lets get into the good stuff: everything else. The story of One Piece is fairly simplistic in nature as its usually just following Luffy and crew from one island to another, usually involving Luffy saving said island from some evil mastermind. Now this might seem like some rinse and repeat idea, but what Oda does to make each arc different is simple: He makes each island have its own genuine feel. In the East Blue arc, all of the islands are generally identical, but there's a reason for that: East Blue is the weakest sea on the planet. Its meant to a more relaxed adventure with more personal problems than outside problems. Once you get to the Grand Line, each island starts to pick up in scale. First big arc is Alabasta, a literal gigantic desert island under the influence of a Warlord. Next is an island in the sky that the crew shoots themselves up to. After that, an island that's' like a giant water utopia, and so on. Each island has its own unique aesthetic as well as a unique set of problems. Each arc feels well crafted and is able to stand on its own two feet in quality.  
 
Next up, the characters. I think this is the biggest thing for a lot of fans because its definitely one of my biggest things about One Piece: I LOVE the main cast. Monkey D. Luffy is a fairly simple character as he's an idiot with a lot of strength and a big dream he's constantly chasing. Sounds pretty familiar, right? Well, Luffy as well as many of the other crew members have plenty of unique things going for them. For one, Luffy isn't a fight crazed protagonist who's constantly seeking a bigger challenge, even if he's constantly picking fights with the big names of the world. Believe it or not, he'd rather go on adventures than fight, even if he does enjoy it to a degree. Not to mention he's aware of his own faults, having assembled a crew that can act in ways that he can't.  
 
Another thing about characters in One Piece is that, somehow some way, Oda does not let any of the named ones go to waste. Somebody who seemed to only have a bit part in the past or seemed insignificant before is very likely to come back up again and have a larger role in the scale of things. The thing about it is, Oda knows how to make even subvillains seem sympathetic if he wants. In the previous arc, a very small time bit villain has a flashback during his fight with one of the crew and it ends up making you feel bad for him. To be honest, I was shocked how much I ended up liking him. His design is so dumb but the design has a reason behind it and you end up thinking 'wow, that's actually cool of him'. Seriously, if anything is the highlight of this series, I'd say its the character moments.  
 
On to the music and sound, the music is pretty on point. It's not the greatest anime OST ever created but it certainly gets the job done. When the series wants you to feel hyped up, its got the track for you. When its got a scene that is sad, you know it's about to play the perfect mood setter. The only complaint I might have about the sound is the eye catchers that pop up when you can tell its switching to commercial. Sometimes those can get annoying and ruin the mood of a scene especially if things are getting intense or sullen. Other than that, the OST is good. 
 
As for the voices, I'd say generally the voices fit each of their roles perfectly. I remember when I first watched One Piece subbed, I thought 'what the hell is up with Luffy's voice??' but as I continued to watch the series, I realized that the VA for Luffy is incredible. Her emotional content and strength of voice is amazing. Not to mention she's actually in her 70's. You have to admire that kind of skill in a VA. When Luffy's going to make a big exclamation, she's right on it. When Luffy's in pain or suffering, she can put that out like nothing. Don't disregard the Japanese VA just because the voice seems childish, she does a fantastic job as Luffy. The same goes for the rest of the crew, but Luffy's VA stands out for me the most. 
 
Well, I believe that about wraps up my review. Overall, while I do prefer the manga to the anime due to the reasons above, there's plenty to love in the anime regardless of that. There's a reason that this series has survived so long and has ruled as the king of Shounen since its arrival. If you don't mind the length and time required to be put in, I highly recommend this series.

    Hahaha... I love one piece. I really do. Found it when the straw hats hit the new world. Watched it from the beginnng like 3 times. I just wish that the show would break for a year so episodes could have more content. Cause with it on the a$$ of the manga. It’s quality is dropping. Dressrosa was the worst arc to get through because it seemed like they were so desperate to slow down they didn’t put anything into any of the episodes. Getting better with the current arc but they really do need to do something. Wether they put the show on hold. Or just add some fillers that would at least have something better than crowds running and a 10min intro

    This is probably one of the greatest shows that I have ever seen. But, this is not a show that you should be considering to watch as one of your first ten anime series. This show should be something that you are wanting to watch because everyone says it's good and you have probably already been watching anime for about a year. I will mention this again ""This is a great show"" but it deserves a huge amount of commitment and your attention. With its current 832 episode marker, you should not treat this as a walk in the park. I was able to start and catch up in about 6 months but, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Take your time. If something catches your eye you can keep watching but it isn't something that I would recommend just to get your episode count up. Again, ""This is a great show"" and if you are just watching it because you have nothing else to watch and you aren't giving you're utmost attention to the show then forget it, it isn't worth your time.  
 
That said I would recommend this show to anyone that likes adventure shows and things like Dragon Ball and Fairy Tail. Also, THIS IS A BIG TIP.  If you have stopped watching One Piece because you don't like the art style, you don't find it interesting, and you are only about 60 episodes in. I can't stress this enough KEEP WATCHING. That is when the show gets good and if you are stopping there then you are missing all of the good parts of the series that come later. There is also something else that I totally recommend doing. Skip from episodes 152-196. This is probably the most boring arc of a series that I have ever watched. It is on par with the Key of the Starry Sky arc from Fairy Tail. If you watch this One Piece arc you are sure to stop the show. It is a guarantee. It is that bad. However, if you are that person who wants to see all of a show because they want to talk to their friends about the series that they have seen all of. I promise you it isn't worth it. Of the 6 months that I mentioned earlier that it took me to catch up one and a half of them were me just watching other things because I was stuck at that arc and I wasn't advancing. I am not saying don't watch it I am just stating that it might be something that you don't necessarily want to watch. 
 
The third and final thing that I am going to mention about One Piece is the opening songs. These opening songs are probably some of the best that there are in shows. All though very rarely do they relate to the plot in the actual visuals, the songs are on point. I have most of them downloaded on Spotify and I can't even tell you how many times I have listened to these songs. They are amazingly good. But I have to warn you. Around the 400 episodes, they have the Toei Animation opening sequence. You might get into a habit of just skipping the whole opening and the recap which is fine but watch out for one thing. While I was watching I got into the habit of skipping the song but I never checked the songs that I was skipping so it turned out that I had skipped two of the openings that I didn't know about. So my advice to you is that you should at least check what you are skipping at least once every 20 episodes. That is really helpful and makes sure that you know about all the openings that are coming up, and you never know you might actually enjoy some of them. 
 
So, in conclusion, you should really consider watching this show and if you don't like it, No big deal but just letting you know there are no other shows like this out there.

    The first time I saw One Piece I was like “Uh, such a bad graphic, I'm going to drop this shit”, but after that I saw a picture of characters evolution and I've started watching OP again 3 months ago. 
 
The story is unique and very attractive, also It's very long but i like how it is. I love how Oda made such a great story called ""The Great Age of Pirates"". Besides this i noticed how nice are combined the fantasy, action and comedy. The story describes a man who want to become ""The Pirate King"". Who hears this will laugh, but Luffy is very serious about this and he wants to make his dream come true. Also Luffy's friends have their dreams too. They want to make their dreams come true, that's why they follow Luffy. Besides this Luffy is a true friends who knows how to transform the enemies in friends. In tine, his friends began to fight for his dream.  
 
The first time i saw the characters i was very disappointed, but after a few episodes I started to love them more and more. The evolution of characters is fucking awesome, they started to be more powerful and more beautiful (the boys are so hot ~ I feel like I am going to die). After 50-100 episodes, the graphic started to change in a better way. Some of the characters have changed significantly. I love the power of the characters and how they're using it. 
 
I really enjoy watching this because it's so hilarious. I laughed so hard at Luffy's imitations and I love how Nami kicks Luffy's, Zoro's and Sanji's ass. ^.^ Usopp is so funny with his 'disseases' like ""Can't-get-on-this-island disease"" and ""I'll-Die-If-I'm-On-My-Own Disease"". Zoro's sense in direction is so bad, I cry laughing every time I watch at his scenes. 
 
In other words this show is so good, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. I have watched many anime series, but One Piece was, is and will be the best anime ever for me and I highly recommend for shounen lovers. I can't stop watching it. So far I give it a 10/10.

    I'm totally in love with One Piece. Years ago, my friend once told me that the top three best anime in the world were Bleach, Naruto and One Piece. Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto, I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece??? I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto. But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day, I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day. Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation. What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. 
Now let's talk about the anime itself: 
 
STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward,a young boy Monkey D. Luffy(17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King,Gol D. Roger.Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates.The series is divided into arcs,each featuring its very own story and setting,each island,each place the straw hat pirates(Luffy and his crew)visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances.And that's one of the best things of OP,you never get bored.You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it.Everything is interesting and everything is fun,Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers.Thats something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly.Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series,especially Luffy,don't really care about their destination,hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all.All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things,get stronger,meet new people and face powerful foes.Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers(episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto,Bleach anyone?).Also the fillers are actually not that bad,sure they are not good but many of them are OK.And thats a huge plus for an anime series. 
 
CHARACTERS:This is where OP really shines.Each character is presented with great detail,they are all quite unique.Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are,why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams.Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other.We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other,they become something very close to a family.That's the kind of bonds they make.Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines.We see why they make the kind of choices they make.Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good.Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause,in their own justice and in their own dreams.  
 
ART AND SOUND:One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation.The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics.The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other(that's a huge plus in anime).The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors,I'm always talking about the original Japanese(don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters.The music,for me at least,is very catchy and actually really well made.However that depends on personal taste,if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it.Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime. 
 
OVERALL ENJOYMENT:One Piece is one of the most,if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find.It really excels in pretty much every field there is.It is the only anime series,or any series,I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me,have I seen a lot).I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure.If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not(oh you will want to continue).Trust me and you won't regret it,just like I did.

    Not a fan but its a decent series. if you wanna see naruto become a stretchy pirate this is for you. a long going series with a bit of character depth very childish nature but has alot of action. its not as good as bleach or naruto itsself but still can be a better watch for you then it was for me. i didnt get far into it but ik it wasnt for me but i can see its a good one for others its some what of a action supernatural war kinda story it has fruits that give power and groups of pirates vs navy while searching for a legendary treasure

    One Piece is overall, a amazing and alluring story. 
 
The story is really well thought of. It has its originality of Devil Fruits, Haki and such. Especially the Pirate Era, the shichibukai system and the 4 emperors of the Grand Line. Though it took inspiration from the anime ""Dragon Ball Z"" an Oda took some real life pirates and turned them into his own, taking bits of them into his characters.  
One Piece, as a long-running anime, was and is a very large piece of hard work. Oda has to keep it exciting with epic fight scenes, cliffhangers (Which I think he's amazing at), and emotional touching scenes. Oda is also really good at foreshadowing, because he has foreshadowed many things from the very beginning of One Piece up to even episode 500+. I do not wish to spoil any of those foreshadowing. 
Back to the subject, Oda makes One Piece successful by keeping the interest flowing (Which he does by the good plot lines of each arc) so that at the end of each anime/manga episode/chapter makes you crave more and more. But that interest will sometimes drop when the fillers come, though some of the fillers are also interesting and hilarious on some occasions. 
The interest also seems to fall rapidly because of the extremely slow pacing in any arc Oda makes.  
Like each big arc (Like East Blue, Alabasta, Sky Island), they all have more than 50 episodes. And 50 episodes is about as long as a year. 
That's why some people don't want to watch One Piece. 
But, if you have the patience to sit down and just watch, I can assure you, there is a very high change you'll enjoy One Piece, a lot.  
 
Art? No, it's not the best. 
At the beginning of One Piece, I have to be honest, the art was pretty bad. But remember this was drawn in the 1990's and they didn't have good technology. The story sometimes can distract you from the art so sometimes when the story gets good, you'll just get dragged into the story deeper and you'll forget everything about the art. 
Thankfully, the art improves greatly as the story progresses. The most noticeable improvement starts about around the Water 7 arc which is about episode 200 or so. By then, the story gets amazing good and you'll start to not care about the art. 
Then, by episode 500, the art is really good. Compared to episode's 1 art to episode 500's, 500 is like the king of pirates while episode 1 is a small frog in a well (Couldn't help but quoting Mihawk there XD). 
It still isn't the best animation but it still earns about a 8/10 by episode 500. 
 
One Piece has a very large variety of sounds that fit the scene super well. From the slurp of noodles to a cymbal clap.  
As for the soundtracks... 10/10, no question. Now I don't know  about you but One Piece has many soundtracks that you could fall in love with and each scene in the anime, Toei Animation knows exactly what soundtrack it goes with and it fits so good, it's like finding the last piece of a puzzle and fitting it in, completing the puzzle. How do they do it? The soundtrack they choose is literally like finding a couple that were meant to be soulmates. The music can go to happy, then immediately go into a emotional melody. 
The openings are the same too. The first opening, ""We Are!"", is super catchy and I just can't help but sing along with it. And I love it when they make ""We Are"" with different voices or recreate it into a different opening. There are a total of 3 ""We Are"" openings. Actually, all of the One Piece openings are catchy and loveable. I also enjoy the narrations in the openings too!  
 
One of the best pros of One Piece is the outstanding character development. Each introduced character has a very unique personality. I don't think any of the introduced characters in One Piece have very similar personalities. That's just my opinion. 
Like Nami, who is pretty mature and takes things serious but then turns into a deceiving mischievous cat when it comes to getting money. Like Zoro, who is very strong but gets lost super easily even when someone is telling him directions. Sanji, who acts cool and is a great cook but loses his cool immediately when he comes across a pretty lady. And Luffy who is a drooling dog when he sees food but can be the most loveable, understanding, mature idiot ever. I don't know but Luffy knows the exact words that people need to hear.  
 
I really enjoyed this anime, as you can tell. My brother started watching One Piece about 4 months before me and it was all I heard him talking about. So, when Winter break started, I decided to start watching One Piece. My brother told me that in the beginning, One Piece was very slow but too me, like him, I fell in love with One Piece on the very very first episode. I actually caught up to episode 700 in a month. That's how good it was for me. Overall, I rate this a proud 11/10.

    One Piece is the greatest story ever told by mankind, a little flawed yet it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.  Thank you Oda, for making my life worth living, I re watched it twice, I still find it so fresh and valuable. I have a tattoo of One Piece on my heart.  From the top notch writing to the unique character designs and development to bad ass quotations to the most iconic moments in Shonen anime history, One Piece has everything what an anime fan has to look for before calling it home.  I live my life following One Piece each and every second.  There's only one thing I'm always worried about One Piece, there's a lot story to be revealed, I want it to continue for more 700-800 episodes (1000 chapters) which would take 15 years, to give importance to each and every unsolved mystery in One Piece, and not to forget the character development, I want the straw hats to look legendary before they get the One Piece.  I'm pretty sure Oda will never disappoint me and million fans who are excited to know more about the greatest story ever witnessed in the history of mankind!

    One Piece is the best anime i ever watched. At first i didnt like it becouse of the art but then i started watching the movies whit my parents and it was great. So we started whatching the anime too.  
The story is excellent a truly masterpiece, the character are really funny and different from everyone. The animation is not very good to begin with, but it is become better afterwards. 
The plots are well-written and hold my attention without taking themselves too seriously and adding unnecessary drama that causes me to lose interest. There is also a good friendship and some touching scenes. 
 
One Piece is an anime about pirates and dreams.. but mostly about dreams.

    If you are Shounen anime lover then u have come to right place my fellow Otaku!! 
One Piece (OP) is the Epic Shounen anime out there...This anime got it all...it's a great anime with the awsome plot,great storyline,hilarious jokes,amusing characters with distinct attitudes,remarkable character development,thrilling adventure and the most important thing is....this anime is one heck of enjoyment...it's not just any action or adventure anime who has few episodes with some unexplained plot to it... 
  It's true that OP is hell of a long anime with lots of episodes to it..but they all worth watching each and every moment of it..because of the deep plot and lots of amazingly explained facts take there sweet time to give us ride of a true anime world!!..I think the best part of the OP is all the chemistry of characters and plot is turns out really great...also the relatively and continue momentum of anime will keeps up hypnotize in the pirate world of One Piece...The X-factor of the OP is the Mystery arises during the storyline...Have great time watching it guyz 😁

    Don't let the odd art style or ridiculous number of episodes deter you from watching this masterpiece.  
There will never be a boring moment.  
You will experience some of the greatest laughs and feels from this series.  
Just when you think you have the characters figured out, they surprise you.  
Oda never forgets a single one of the characters that he creates and neither will you.  
You don't just watch One Piece.  
You live it alongside the crew as they sail on the open seas on their grandiose adventure.

    It is difficult to sum up the story of a series with hundreds of episodes, TV specials and movies, so I'd rather just try to tell you what it is about and why it is so incredibly good. 
 
The series starts off with a guy named Luffy whose ultimate goal it is to become the one and only ""King of all Pirates"" and to find the greatest treasure in the world. The first episodes introduce him and some characters and make a lovely start that is entertaining and makes one want more. On his way Luffy meets a lot of very interesting characters who become his crew members and friends - each of them with an intense and captivating background story. Every character in this series - be it friend or foe - is either adorable, tragic, despicable or interesting at the least... no boring characters anywhere. Later on in the series, important events and story twists are often visualized or supported by huge appearances in the fabulous and unreal environments that our crew travels. This is perfectly done and helps the already epic feel of the story. I have seen 150 episodes, four movies and two specials so far and there were moments that made me cry, laugh, think and re-watch some episodes (especially 85-90) at least 30 times. You might come to the false conclusion of having a kids show here due to the presentation, but that is definitely wrong. People sometimes say about a movie or series that it is ""not a life changer, but entertaining"". That is definitely not the case here! I know it sounds nerdy, but this series has broadened my horizon in many ways and I recommend anyone to take the admittedly long time to get into this epic adventure. The best way to do so will be to watch the fan-subs which are as close to the original as a non Japanese will get (explanations of puns and traditions). There are of course some filler episodes in a huge project like this which won't blow you away, but that is only natural with hundreds of episodes and helps developing the characters.

    ONE PIECE , am gonna talk about one piece in many points ... 1) STORY (10/10): the story in one has no ending , by that i mean that there is a lot of things that happens and need explains and you don't know when are they gonna explain it , a take this as a good thing , because oda has showed us how a big and huge mind he have .... 2) ART (9/10) :  the manga has an amazing art and incredible also , but when you come to the anime am Afraid that it's unstable , i think the reason is because they have a lot of directors in all the episodes , and that gonna make the drawing always changing .. 3) SOUND (10/10) : i don't know what exactly they mean about sound , maybe its the sound track , the sound is incredibly amazing it actually fits the pirates , and also it's diverse ... 4) CHARACTER (10/10) : absolutely the best anime in character kind , there more then 100 hundred amazing characters , and they all not the same , you can find every one different then the other one , for example luffy : he is funny strong and every one loves him , and in the other hand there is doflamingo   : he is very very smart and had a really evil planning and you can't expect what he is doing and he is absolutely very powerful , and that's a divers ... 5) ENJOYMENT (9/10) : the reason that i did not the enjoyment a full score is because of the comedian moments that they put it into an amazing fight , it ruin the the enthusiasm of the battle and it's really not the time ... 6 ) OVERALL (10/10) : of course am going to give one one piece 10 of 10 , this anime is come once in life , big adventures and fighting never end , this anime needs two things , the first thing is the art of the episodes not the manga , it needs more taking care of , the second thing is the long time that they take in one story , they need to hurry up more , cut some of the useless scenes . thank you for reading  my review

    One piece! Seriously a great story! I liked the plot a lot and the character Luffy is just amazing. He gives a very positive impression about how people should live their life - simple, without worries, taking challenges and working hard to achieve the goal. All the characters' behavior is appropriate and suits to them. 
All songs especially the opening ones are so good. I actually downloaded them and I listen to them frequently. And the whole anime is so well made. Each scenery, each island and the sea looks so unique and beautiful. The action is so exciting and the suspense is just thrilling. What will happen next? Who will do what? That's the question I have every time I watch an episode. And I really enjoyed watching it. 
Some drawbacks are the extended fights that just go on for episodes and one gets bored to wait for the fight to finish. There are some fillers which are out of story line and aren't much interesting. One piece is going a bit slow, which I hate the most.  
But, the overall story is great, characters are great and its fun watching it.

    Just finished the Marineford arc and  suppose that I should make a review on what I've watched so far. 
 
The plot actually is quite good, even though carrying the mainstream shounen anime and a little bit straight-forward. As you watch the anime, you can easily tell  that every episode is intriguing ( I don't know if you want to count fillers ). Also, every arc I watched so far does not disappointed me at all, even though some maybe better than the others. And it is also have originality, maybe because its concept that is rare in shounen anime. Just because it left a complexity, I'll rate the story 8. 
 
The art is not so compelling as the story is at the beginning, but as you follow every episode, the art is beginning to improve. Although not as good as the other newer animes, the art is good enough for at least myself. I'll rate the art 7. 
 
The soundtracks, OP and ED are really good and well placed, suitable with the story that is about the pirates and adventures. Guess I'll say nothing more about the sound and rate it 8. 
 
The character development of every Straw Hat crew is quite good, considering the adventure that they had experienced. It's impressive how the adventure had make them more mature and stronger in terms of physical, mental, emotion and their will. I'll rate it 8. 
 
The anime is really, really, really enjoyable. The anime can make you laugh, being amazed and cry at the same time. So, I'll rate the enjoyment 10. 
 
Overall, this anime is one of the best anime that I've watched so far. Why not the best? Because there are some anime that is same level as One Piece. BTW, I'd recommend this for those who loves shounen anime. So, say no more, I'll rate this anime an outstanding 10. 
 
P/S : And for those who says that this anime sucks, open your hearts please. One Piece isn't as bad as you think. Don't be so judgmental just because the art is not so compelling, the episodes are too many or whatever that makes it looks bad to you. Just give it a try.

    This anime is BY far the best anime series out there 500+ episodes will prove that.  If you do not watch this anime or at least some of it then just give up on anime.  This anime will make you laugh until you cry and all of a sudden you will be crying from how emotional it can be.  Also, Nami and Robin are HOT.  Overall this anime is a MUST watch for all people who watch anime on a regular basis.

    What should I say about this Anime? 
Now I'm not one for long running Anime's, always drawn into things like FullMetal Alchemist and Code Geass... but what surprised be about One Piece was the CHARACTERISATION. 
 
You follow the story of a young green-horn pirate called Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to find the One Piece. Leaving his home town on a journey to become Pirate King. Along the way he meets friends who he takes upon his crew where there the story only just begins as trial and error becomes apparent in their every turn. This forms the crew called the Straw Hat Pirates. 
If that short snippit doesn't seem like much, let me explain.  
 
If you're full on personalities of characters, Eiichiro Oda has provided that in One Piece with a DON. No matter what character you meet, even if you hate them or love them, have a backstory so unique to them that you can't ever shake it off. It attaches to you. If something happens to a character, it's never forgotten, if there's a bonding between two characters it instantly becomes apparent through each episode you watch and never breaks.  
You will find yourself having feelings for characters you would believe to be side fluff, but instead you have those tissues out ready to blow your nose. You're not just journeying with the Straw Hat pirates, you're EXPERIENCING and LEARNING with them, you're almost taken on board with what's happening which makes the experience so gratifying.  
 
The negatives is it's a hard series to get into, and I fully suggest if you start watching One Piece, or beginning the Manga, that you STICK WITH IT. If you want to see the juiciness of what this creation is all about this Anime does need a lot of your time and efforts to push through to the engaging episodes. 
When you reach engaging episodes, sometimes there will be some areas where they drag it on way too long and you find yourself frowning at the screen because the same fight has been happening for 5-10 episodes. This IS COMMON EARLY ON, however it becomes less and less in the later series. 
Filler, even though it's few and very far between, is awful. There is a mini series episodes tucked which is dedicated to a few spin off titles of One Piece that are not so bad but the filler... is just filler. There's nothing special about it, although it's understandable why filler happens. 
 
When I started One Piece I had a lot of free time on my hands, it almost became a daily watch for me since I had the time after my studies during University which is why I got so far in such a short time. However, don't let not having any time deceive you from watching this Anime if you are interested because I promise it gets awesome. Real awesome. 
I can't stop watching it any way.  
 
Happy Sailing!

    I cant make a good preview, but this is from mine 
 
Story, from the story its good when a young man wants to become a pirate king and oda sensei write the story from 1997, all the stories were unexpectedly. Like from the start of the stories oda is always giving a clue what will happen in the next episode, or the future episode. the story is good, imagine how can a 17 years old boy sailing in the sea with a small boat from his hometown, and now he got a wanted poster over hundred million.  
 
Art, honestly the art was not very good but not bad too.  
 
Sound, the sounds is good. like a punch, background sound, fighting scene, and the seiyuu they are all making a good sounds. at first i dont know if luffy was roled by a woman :D. because her sound was very deep and yeah its feel like she is a boy :/ 
 
Character, the character was very good i think. luffy is searching ""nakama"" with a passion and he was already thought how much he must get friends to sailing in the sea. His right hand and also vice captain, his navigator, sniper (  even though he is using catapult), chef, doctor, archaeologist, carpenter, musician, he is finding a different friends to making his ship better and better. 
 
Enjoyment, i am really enjoy this and starting imagine how if i had a devil fruit too, or haki? aaahh that makes me crazy :D 
 
Overall, overall one piece is very good and i highly recommend to watch it. even the manga and anime is within 20 episodes, but i still waiting the anime ( even though i knew the story ) 
 
So, that are from me. good bye have a nice day

    This is a spoiler-free review which covers 759 episodes of the show. 
One Piece is a series that needs no introduction at this point, it is well known for many things both good and bad. I will try to bring a new viewpoint to the table, so bear with me. 
 
I have been stuck watching the show since 2011 and I would describe my experience with the first 500 episodes or so as a beautiful journey. I would recommend it to any shounen loving anime fan. However the quality drops rather significantly after those five hundred. We get some of the laziest animations I’ve ever seen, uninspiring fillers, unnecessary recaps and ‘Reaction Faces, The Anime’. These are complaints you have most likely heard before, especially the recap one. One Piece is now often compared to a bag of chips, that is 60% bagged air and 40% actual content. But why do we still watch it? 
 
I myself couldn’t drop this series, so one day I sat down and tried to watch an episode to evaluate it objectively with nothing obscuring my view. And the answer came to me much sooner than I’d expected, right after the opening song stopped playing. Those of you familiar with the show already know what comes next, which is two sections of recaps, both told by a Narrator. First one about our protagonist and the second one about several previous episodes. While most One Piece fans don’t particularly fancy this part because it takes up to 4 minutes out of the show, I have never once in my life seen a person who would actually dislike the Narrator himself. It’s the opposite, we love the guy. His voice is enjoyable and relaxing and connects us to our childhoods, right? We can have nothing but respect towards this person. Which got me thinking, what exactly is my relationship with Narrator-san? I sit there alone in my room in front of the screen with the curtains drawn and have his silky voice fill my ears with unwanted information time and time again, an experience that can only be referred to as torture, and yet I cannot bring myself to hate Narrator-sensei. This sadomasochistic relationship is now lasting for over five years and there is no way I can deny or escape it. 
 
So why do we still watch this show? The answer is rather simple. Because Narrator-sama is S, and we are M, he is dominating us and we secretly like it. 
 
P.S.: Adding to already existing problems, the pacing becomes near unbearable during Dressrosa arc. I would like to say that it gets better later, but it doesn't. So here is my final piece of wisdom: do yourself a favor and put the playback speed at x1,50 or search for One Pace project online.

    The manga is a 10 for me. The anime could have been something better but no, Toei just had to ruin it with that pacing. The pacing issue causes the anime to deviate from the source in small but significant manner. And I can't believe people still defend it saying things like ""Hey the animation quality is good now so its fine"", ""The dragging on is better because it adds to the enjoyment"" or ""they have to do this as it will catch on with the manga"". That's utter BS. One piece is not the only anime that has the problem of catching up to the source material but no other anime adapts HALF A CHAPTER of the manga in ONE EPISODE. 
 
This is nothing but a massive disappointment. You can watch the anime until it starts dragging on in the return to sabaody arc, but from that point either switch to manga or you can find fan made edits of the episodes which are made as faithful to the manga as possible

    At the start of the anime it seems pretty lit at the start he's just all rubbery and he's just like ""lol i'm rubber haha"" and he hits people n stuff haha. It seems to drop off a bit for me since the super powers get a lil far fetch'd n stuff so it's like a bit stupid when he just shouts something and wins just cause hes rubber like I get rubber is strong n all that but it's a lil stupid ya get me?  
 
Idk I liked it for a while and it had its moments but I feel like it can't make the LONG HAUL work very well and just isn't great for new viewers since ITS SO LONG like who has the motivation??  
 
Overall: 7/10

    Don't hate it, but dropped it around Fishman Island due to decrease in production quality. Continued after that in manga only. This is my choice of the old ""big four"" and the only one that is still ongoing (apart from the restarted DB). 
 
I highly suggest One Piece even as an anime even though it has horrible amounts and many kinds of filler stuck with it. Some moments of the story are delivered with just that much punch that it's worth it. The animation quality decreases drastically after the time skip, so be wary. The time skip also kinda splits the story in two halves.  
 
Join me, millions of others and Luffy as he gathers his crew, captures everyone's hearts and seeks out to be the one true king of the seas. Your efforts will be paid off.

    One piece is an amazing series with great story, art, pacing, and characters... IF i was talking about the manga the anime has many issues most that come later in it that earlier. And i'm not just talking about filler the anime if full of animation issues(that comes later most of it starts around and after the time skip) and pacing issues. If you want to enjoy one piece to the fullest read the manga and maybe go back to some episodes that hold your favorite moments in the manga this is what I've done since i dropped the anime and started reading the manga at the suggestion of a friend. One piece is a great and compelling series but just like many things the adaptation falls short (but only after a certain point the beginning is still pretty good.) so please read the manga.

    One Piece .... My favorite Anime of all time. Here in this review let me tell you why.  
 
Firstly One Piece might look like your typical kind of Shonen but no! One Piece is very unique in many ways like a character's laughter, different kind of race/type of people in the OP Universe, how characters from an episode are link to future episodes or having a background which connects to the past. Oda-sensei(The Mangaka) doesn't ""throw away"" characters he made even though its a minor role. These minor role characters will be appearing or being thought of again in the series. Oda-sensei is just that good in character development! Almost every episode of One Piece is important and if you miss 1 or 2 episodes, you are actually missing quite a lot. One Piece is an Anime which you must never underestimate it because if you were to sit down and really think about it, One Piece is actually a very very deep series.  
 
Story Rating: 9/10 
 
Character's art and animation ... Well, the earlier episodes of One Piece definitely looks old and of course not HD(But I think there's a remake of the earlier episodes? Which was made in HD). But that doesn't matter. As you watch on, the art gets better and better. Not really something to be bothered with. As for the animation, sometimes it is quite bad but usually happens in those unimportant scenes.  
 
Art/Animation Rating: 8/10  
 
For the Sound, its good which I'll rate it 9/10.  
 
So in overall, such a long Anime definitely might get boring at certain parts due to history talking or draggy scenes but fret not, those are still important because almost everything in One Piece are linked.  
 
Overall Rating: 8.7/10

    One Piece is a pirate story centered around the Strawhat Pirates and their captain Monkey D. Luffy 
 
Story: The story is a fairly simple one yet amusing. A boy wished to be the Pirate king and step on the footprints of the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger, How will he accomplish his goal? By finidng the mythical teasure left from the former pirate king, the treasures name? One Piece. The quest starts w/ Luffy trying to recruit members for his crew and making his dream come true. His crew though has dreams too which can be accomplished by following the crazy meat-eater Luffy. Ahoy maety, time to set sail. Did I mention that Luffy has eaten the Gomu-Gomu no Mi which gave Luffy the abillity to stretch himself like rubber? What awaits as in the this Pirate world is a mystery yet to see it unfold to it's fullest. 8/10 
 
Art: The animation is this anime is rather dull in the 1st part and get more joyful later on. It's nothing to be amazed at, but it doesn't let you down, We colorful setting and stuff and fanservice for both gentlemen and ladies. I'll say just two sentences for this and end this here. 1st part We get a flat chested Nami and on second part we get a BIG chested Nami. For our ladies? All males have a pretty muscular body which sometimes makes me wonder why I'm not like that. 6/10 
 
Sound: The sound in this anime is quite good and relaxing or intense depending on the  situtation. One Piece has usually good OPs and EDs but not to go crazy about which is kinda dissapointing for such a legendary anime. The OST can make you grow some feelings be it anger, laugh or being on the verge. 7/10 
 
Enjoyment: If you like shounen type anime this is definitelly for you since it's fully action packed and has everything a shounen fan loves. The bad thing isn One Piece though is that the recpas are pretty damn annoying in he latest episoded cause they happen on each and every episode, that's riiight! In every ep you can and almost full recap, IDK what TOEI Animation thinks of it's viewers, but we are not so short on memory ppl, we are not goldfishes. All in all though and pretty enjoying anime worth the time. 7/10 
 
So overal I give One Piece and 8/10 cause of the beautifull and ragefull moments it gave me which I actually treasure. 
 
Hope this helps you.

    When I first embarked on the journey of One Piece I honestly did not know what to expect. After catching up with Naruto and found myself perusing different anime trying to find something similar to Naruto. After watching a few rather short series, I was intrigued by One Piece but quickly became dissuaded as the episode count was around 400+ at this point. Well I decided to wait till I had free time to watch it. Fast forward a couple of months. It's the summer break, I'm bored at home one day and decide to give One Piece a go. I'll admit that while the first couple of episodes were enjoyable, I could tell that I was not truly hooked on the series. The art style was rather strange, a lot of characters had disproportionately large feet compared to their bodies. The animation in the beginning is also not that great as this is an old series(however both the art style and animation improve over time). The episode that threw all doubt about this series was the Baratie Arc. In the early East Blue saga, Baratie is my favorite arc for a numerous amount of reasons. The themes touched upon during that arc spoke of the power of will, ambition, and dreams. This is was the moment I knew I was in it for the long haul. 
 One Piece is still continuing with the end still quite a distance away. This anime while containing basic shounen elements, such as a not too bright protagonist with a goal and having friendship be a key aspect, is able to contain a lovable quirky main cast, most of which are not one dimensional characters, a vast and unique world which is brimming with adventure, and a milieu of interesting characters and plots contained within it. My favorite aspect of One Piece is the adventure and exploration, the mangaka Eiichiro Oda was definitely successful in creating an interesting and vibrant world, and the anime for the most part conveys it well. 
The animation quality is the biggest complaint I have with this anime. For a majority of the series the animation quality is actually pretty good,it started off poor but steadily improved. After the Skypiea arc the improvement is significant. The quality lasts like this until the Marineford Arc, after which it devolves. Currently, due to almost catching up with the manga in terms of content, coupled with the poor animation quality by Toei has made the One Piece anime drop in quality, which is a shame because One Piece has a sacred spot in my top 5 manga.

    One Piece based on the manga by Eiichiro Oda has been airing since 1999. During its currently 17 years on TV the series has managed to attract a lot of attention and not few will call it one of the greatest shounen series that were ever made.  
 
Story: 
 
Off all the shounen anime series I have watched One Piece (OP) has one of the most interesting main stories. There is Gol D. Roger's notorious treasure One Piece, whose discovery makes the finder Pirate King, and Luffy, in pursuit of it. 
I guess I don't need to say much more about this since it can be considered common knowledge in the anime world.  
Furthermore, OP also offers other interesting stories which will keep the viewers glued to the screen, e. g. Sanji's ""All Blue"" and Nico Robin's ""Hieroglyphs"". In fact all main characters have their goals they pursue, while assisting Luffy. Nothing out of the ordinary, though, since it's quite usual for shounen anime. 
So far for the main storyline. However, when it comes to the other, normal adventures the Strawhats go through, OP lacks much. A usual arc has terrible pacing with many episodes were literally nothing happens (imagine members of the crew running to a certain place of importance, packed into nearly 25 minutes). Arcs are pretty much endless fightings until Luffy takes care of the main villain. This can make it very difficult to watch OP, for arcs often take longer than a year to finish (and some, like the recently finished one, even two). In fact, OP can sometimes feel like an ordeal. But ultimately, once arcs near its end  
 
Art: 
 
OP's animation style can be described best as happy, joyful... and childish. Absolutely everything in it looks amusing and you get the feeling the series is constantly laughing at itself. Being animated that way often ruins the mood in serious moments, however, even in those OP tries to stay funny anyway, so it doesn't really matter and over time one gets used to it. Honestly, I could not imagine One Piece to be animated differently. 
 
Sound: 
 
The soundtrack really is nothing special; it contains some catch tunes that fit the OP universe and highlight the battle scenes. I assume especially Luffy's tune when he's ready for combat is a classic already.  
 
Characters: 
 
OP has a huge cast of characters, beginning with the Strawhat crew, who you just have to like. I'm not going into detail here since it can be considered common knowledge. However, one thing I want to point out is the two females, who often play no role whatsoever and mainly seem to be there to seldom assist in some battles, or for fanservice, highlighted by their hilariously big breast, something which is by the way very normal in the anime actually. 
Apart from the Strawhats, you have a hole bunch of other characters and nakama, many of them funny and annoying at the same time (OP manages to do that). Well, it's the usual shounen anime characters where dealing with. As I like shounen, I find most of them enjoyable. 
 
Enjoyment and overall: 
 
Long-running arcs and mostly terrible pacing throughout the series, and furthermore the typical OP childishness are flies in the ointment, but nevermind all those because it's OP, and somehow there's always something enjoyable about it; maybe it's the weekly shounen madness, waiting for Luffy to go to action, the excitement when an arc ends and a new one starts, long story short, One Piece is, even after more than 700 episodes, still a great series for fans of easygoing fighting anime. And those who breathe shounen will love it anyway.

    One Piece is a different sort of beast than other shows. I'd undeniably recommend anyone to watch it, but the issue lies in that in order to really get a feel for how good the series can be. In my opinion the series isn't very good until the Baratie arc that starts at episode 19, and only really begins to show how good it can be at the Arlong arc at episode 31.  
 
That isn't to say the early episodes are god awful or anything. But if I was only rating the series based on the earliest episode I'd probably saddle it with a 6.5 (fine, but not good).  
 
So the thing about One Piece is that it does require investment. But after those 19 or 30 episodes, the payoff is enormous. There is nearly 700 more episodes of a great anime with limited filler. One Piece just really checks all the boxes for me: it can be funny, can bring you to tears, and can be undeniably badass.  
 
As I have been reviewing shows more and more, I've noticed that one of the aspects that leads to me to rate shows more highly is the world they take plae in. In plenty of great shows, you have a set world and you are exploring the characters story within that world, but One Piece leaves you exploring the world along with Luffy, as his story progresses. There is so many mysteries yet to be solved in One Piece, and discovering more and more about it is part of what makes One Piece so grand.  
 
The characters are also done pretty well. The dynamic of the crew really represents an all for one, one for all type mentality. A lot of dramatic events happen throughout the show, and watching people come together through those hardships is endearing.  
 
Really the only reason that this is not a 10 for me is that I reserve my 10's for shows I consider true masterpieces, that can't be improved (I only have two 10's). And for as great as OP is, it does have it's issues. It starts pretty slow and it's pacing could be better (if you are watching week to week, this gets pretty frustrating. As a binge it isn't as big of a deal though). Also, the art is meh. I do kind of like how unique it is and it does get better as the show progresses, but this can't really touch some other great shows when it comes to the art. Although it is done much better than other shonens and not as prevalent, there is some filler. Even though the filler arcs aren't bad the core series is definitely much better.  
 
So, quick summary. Slow starter (give it at least 20 episodes), but fantastic plot and interesting world to explore and learn more about as you are watching the series. Humor is Good. Drama and the feels can be spectacular in big moments. The action and fight scenes are good. Watch One Piece!

    I really took me a while to start watching One Piece, I was too lazy for is a very long anime !! But something inside me stirred up the desire to sail the seas of One Piece. If you are thinking how I was, take a chance to One Piece, I believe you will certainly want to embark with Monkey D. Luffy in the most incredible adventures the Grand Line to search for the legendary treasure One Piece. 
But first, Luffy looking for a crew, and you will be enchanted with each new member. From beginning we are introduced to each of them, their life stories and especially their dreams. It is interesting how the dreams of each connect in a peculiar way to Luffy, causing them to unite on an incredible journey. Gradually the gang is being formed and coming together like a puzzle. 
And speaking in the troop, I admire the way in One Peice explore friendship and companionship. More than how members of a family, each fighting the other, they take their pain, give the blood to protect his companion as hard as it may seem the battle. As captain, Luffy is what more worries about your nakamas! 
The straw hat gang face harsh battles along the journey. Many ruthless enemies crossing your way some of them stand out for me as Arlong, Crocodile, Enel and of course the World Government are the most terrible so far. 
Of course, not everything is made of hard battles! One Piece always finds a way to start a good laugh, often starring Luffy, Usopp and Chopper, who do mischief on the ship during the trips. While all is quiet and its nakamas are fine, Luffy not worry about anything except food! What many times does look like he is not captain. 
One Piece also take many tears of our hearts! Some of our gang have stories really suffered as Nami and Robin. But as I said Luffy always take the pain of your friends and fight for them to the end. 
One Piece has a wonderful soundtrack, to remember the older animes. Art can seem strange at first, but you get used quickly. However, if you like adventure, laughter, emotions and the power of friendship I'm sure you will love One Piece!

    One Piece is excellent in every single way. The characters are deep and interesting, the world feels really alive and fleshed out, and Oda really knows how to pace arcs correctly.  
Sadly, the anime adaptations goes from good to great to amazing to ok to absolute clusterfuck. It's a really depressing case of unending anime series syndrome. I remember watching this about 7 years ago when there were about 400 epipsodes, and you could mostly skip all the filler arcs and end up with a kind of sluggish but overall enjoyable series, but later arcs, I believe starting at about episode 430-ish, have a lot more filler INSIDE the actual adaptation arcs, which makes it that much more difficult to get around. I've also seen some of the newer fights, and they were really disappointing. The animation was really bad compared to the better arcs (Enies Lobby, Thriller Bark and Shabaody Archipielago). 
My recommendation for watching One Piece is: look for a guide that says which episodes are filler, and try to skip as much of it as possible. If it ever becomes unbearable, switch to the manga. 
Personally, as soon as I caught up with the anime, I started reading the manga. I still read it to this day and it's on my top 3 manga list, alongside FMA and Magi.

    The One Piece is a really in enjoyable anime! Its about Monkey D. Luffy and his straw hat pirates as they currently adventure through the New World. The Story is Awesome, my only problem with the story is the filler in the anime. From Episodes 1-206 I give the art about a 6/10, but starting with Episode 207 the art really improves as starting with this episode, the anime was in HD. The Sound and Music are good and the Voice acting is good nothing bad there. For the main I love there character! Luffy is dense but in situations he really is smart! Zoro is Bad-Ass even when he sleeps and its funny when he gets lost! And every other straw hats character are awesome to! The anime very funny and comedic, and the fights are awesome. I would have my favorite is the Enies Lobby Arc because I like how it told Robin's backstory and the fights through they show that all of the characters are useful unlike DBZ where Goku gets most of the spot light. Overall i'd give the One Piece anime a 9/10 or 10/10.

    Before I begin my review, I would like to tell you that I will be completely honest about what I like about One Piece and what I don't. I'm not a fanboy, and I've been a HUGE fan of Naruto/Naruto Shippuden for over 8 years prior to starting One Piece. Few other long running anime I've watched and loved, Hunter X Hunter, Gintama, Detective Conan, Dragon Ball Z. (I've watched/read all of Fairy Tail, loved it then started hating it, just like many others). I say this so that when I say One Piece is my absolute favorite among shonen anime, you will understand how much I actually love One Piece. I started One Piece a little over a year ago and it has quickly become my favorite. I have never regretted starting One Piece..except for the fact that I'm kind of obsessed with it now. Lol. 
 
P.S: Ignore any typos. And grab some snacks because it's a very long review. 
 
My review will be quite long (too many good things about One Piece) but I will include a shorter/summary version at the bottom if you don't have time. But I suggest you go through it all :) 
 
Let me start with the negatives, which is only one and is only concerned with the Anime. 
 
Negatives: The Anime has terrible/painful pacing, especially during the Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Punk Hazard, Dressrosa arcs. This however, is exlusive to the Anime version and can be overcome by skipping through episodes, skipping fillers (if you wish), etc. So it's not too much of a concern. You'll just have the trouble of waiting for at least a week just to get an episode that cover one or less than one chapter (which is quite less). 
 
Now coming to the pros. There are a LOT of amazing things about One Piece. 
 
Plot (10/10): The plot of One Piece is the single largest plot of any popular anime that has come out thus far. I say this with confidence as other long running series like Detective Conan, Hajime no Ippo (which are very good themselves) have a narrower plot. One Piece has phenomenal world building. Without spoiling too much, it occurs in it's own UNIVERSE and time. In terms of the vastness of the setting, only Dragon Ball Z comes close. 
 
There's several hundreds of different/unique powers. Most of these powers (including that of the protagonist) are completely fresh/never before seen anywhere, not just in anime. (And no, it's not just Devil Fruits) 
 
The plot intensifies exponentially and increases in complexity as it progresses. The first 100 episodes, it's just the pirate Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist, and a his first few crew mates sailing to find the One Piece, a legendary treasure that has been left at the last island of a harsh, destructive Ocean called the Grand Line. But soon we realize a lot more. In the next 100 episodes we learn more about the ACTUAL plot. By the 200s, we have a very well established plot line, but it still grows. In the following 100-200 episodes we learn much more..and so on. By the first 400 or so episodes, the setup is done and everything that follows is just pure awsomeness. With every passing arc, the story gets better and better. However, there is on not-so-important arc which is mostly for comedy which I personally loved (like almost every other One Piece fan, so you probably will too) 
 
People often complain about how long One Piece is, but let me tell you this, that's how big and vast the plot is. It REQUIRES time.  You will have to be patient. Everything that happens in One Piece happens for a good reason, but it does take time. So be patient and try to watch as many episodes as possible. You can binge watch it and finish it in 3-months (Like I did) (as of 28th March, 2016) or watch it slowly over the course of a year.  
 
The plot is always, ALWAYS filled with mysteries. Some answered soon, some so EPIC that we can only learn of them when the series reaches it's end. This is one of the things that keeps me going. 
 
It always has comedy. Many many epic moments and even more to come (it'll be obvious once you catch up to either the Anime or the Manga). Honestly, I've been a One Piece fan for very little over a year now but I don't see myself disliking it ever. I have more than enough confidence in Eiichiro Oda's story writing that was built through 734 episodes and 820 chapter (and still counting). I was never disappointed with any aspect of the plot of One Piece (Except maybe one, but that's completely insignificant). One Piece has many great/amazing/epic fights. However, let me warn you, there's many mediocre/decent to good fights as well. I would recommend Dragon Ball Z, Hunter x Hunter, or Naruto for fights. The fights in One Piece are are not as good as in these but are still very good and enjoyable so no worries here.  
 
Even if everything else (art, sound, fights) were terrible, (which obviously is not the case. It's the exact opposite) the plot alone is worth a 10/10 overall. Trust me. There's a 90%+ chance that you will feel the same. 
 
If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into this. 
 
Also, contradictory to what some might say, One Piece is not repetitive. There is always a reason for why something happens and its almost always different. So be prepared for an exciting, adventurous, enjoyable, funny, action packed, suspenseful story...I mean epic. That's right, One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. 
------------------ 
 
Characters (10/10): One Piece is filled with several amazing characters whom you will love and several others whom you will hate (amazing evil-minded, hateful villains).  
Shanks, an amazing character introduced early on, has in fact inspired the creation of a very popular character in another series! Gildarts from Fairy Tail. 
 
There's a vast variety of personalities you will find in One Piece.  and many important characters have great character development. Both the antagonists and the protagonists have great moments and undergo proper development. 
--------------------- 
 
Animation (7/10): The animation of One Piece is not good. However, epic moments, epic fight scenes, etc. are almost always very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie level animation! If you don't believe it, watch it! (Full of spoilers though, obviously) The animation is great when required. Other times, it's quite still and stocky. But this shouldn't be much of a concern either as the important parts are seldom badly animated. The series goes HD somewhere near the early 200s because it started in 1997 so don't judge it too soon :P 
 
You can look up Naotoshi Shida scenes in One Piece. He is a very famous animator and has created several beautifully animated scenes for One Piece.  
----------------------- 
 
Art (9/10): You must've heard, One Piece has a very unique art style. It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD 
 
The backgrounds are always amazing and full of detail. There are thousands gorgeous shots/panels. 
--------------------- 
 
Sound (9/10): The One Piece soundtrack is also one of my favorites. The background scores fit the situations perfectly. Suspense building, action, adventurous, uplifting, you name it. There's tracks for all this. It's heavily orchestral. I often find myself listening to the soundtracks as they are quite epic.  
---------------------- 
 
So yeah, that's it. Overall, One Piece is superb, excellent, amazing, awesome, etc. Few downs here and there but those are very insignificant in comparison. 
 
--------------------- 
 
 
SHORT VERSION 
 
The plot of One Piece is absolutely amazing. It grows in complexity as it progresses and is always filled with intriguing mysteries. The main plot line is more than just finding treasure and becoming the Pirate King. It's unbelievably huge. One Piece has a vast setting and amazing world building with epic, unique powers that were never heard of before. There's always comedy, adventure, action, mystery, and fun in One Piece. 
 
Due to it's vastness and complexity, One Piece is very very long. However, ignoring the bad pacing of the Anime (only) it is never boring. 
 If you feel like an episode is being dragged, forward it, or skip through a few stretched parts (Like 30 seconds of smoke, 5 minute stare-downs, 6 minutes of recap, etc.) The slow pacing can be easily overcome. 
 
Everything in One Piece happens for a reason, and it is seldom repetitive (contradictory to what a few others say). Has many great fights that are often very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie-level animation. But fights aren't it's strong point (though they are epic). 
 
If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into deaths. 
 
Amazing variety in characters. There are characters whom you will absolutely love, and others, like villains, whom you will hate (in the good way. Evil villain = more hate). And there's villains who are badass as well. Many intriguing personalities and backstories. Great character development 
 
Art style is unique and character designs are almost always amazing.  It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD 
 
Has very good soundtracks that capture the moment perfectly. 
 
One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. 
----------------------------------- 
 
One Piece has quickly grown to be my favorite shonen anime. I hope you enjoy One Piece and one day we could probably spend hours and hours just talking about it.  
 
Patience is key when watching One Piece. But you will most probably get hooked to it pretty soon. But make sure you have time. 
 
For those on mobile

    This is the few anime I have decided to not rush through the story plot and slowly watch the journey. As I know there is not ending anytime soon.  
 
After looking through the first few episodes, I believe it has already caught my attention. I believe it has a great story. It has deep meaning. At the start, the boy was panicking about not succeeding. However, Luffy knocked on his head and said the possibility doesn't matter, but he wanted to be pirate king cos he wanted to. Friendship is also emphasized.  
 
After reading reviews, this story seems to be able to reflect on life. I'll look forward to reading this story and savor its essence.

    One Piece! This anime is definitely aimed more towards kids but in a way that even a 30 year old man will like for sure.Why? you ask. For one because it is filled with happy characters and you get a happy feel to it. Also because it is filled with awesome action and pirates. I will guarantee that even if you think it looks horrible in the beginning(which i did) you will like it after you keep watching. 
 
Art-(8) The art is very unique for its time and is not all that good in the beginning considering the time the anime started, but it gets a 100x if not 1000x better after you keep watching. 
 
Characters-(9) All the main characters have different personalities and backgrounds and all give a really nice happy up-feel feeling. 
 
Story-(10) I rate the story of an anime by how unique it is and the enjoyment of it, and this anime is extremely unique and enjoyable and you will not find another anime with such a good unique idea for the story. 
 
This anime is the kind of anime that when you have a bad morning and have a bad day for the rest of the day you will be able to keep going because you will have the feeling of looking forward to at least one thing and that will be going home after everything bad happens to you all day and watching this anime. 
If you have the time to watch an anime with 500+ episodes watch this one. 
 
Hope my review helped you guys. Thanks

    I keep hearing good, bad, and mixed reviews about this series.  I've watched a few episodes sporadically over the many years it's been out...and let's be real here:  It's interesting, but gets old quick, just like DBGT did. 
 
Being a bias anime lover, I give everything a chance and pay close attention to the story line.  If I had to put this anime into genre, I'd go with Comedy and Adult Humor.  Why Adult Humor?  Seriously...do ANY of you pay attention to the various hidden puns? 
 
Moving On. 
I intend to complete this series before the year is up, but based on everything I have seen, read and heard...My score will remain solid :-)

    One Piece 
One Piece is different from other long running shounen series because while other series degraded in quality towards their end One Piece even though has a episode count of 756 hasnt  even a bit in infact it just keeps on getting better 
Story- The strong points of One piece is its story on the surface its basically of Luffy wanting to become the pirate king  but if you actually watch it then the richness of the story will come out  each island in one piece has its own story each arc is important in one piece while after the time skip the pacing has kinda slowed down specially during dressrosa but One Piece is best watched while Marathoning the series. 
Characters- Like islands each character is important in the overall story of one piece not only the Sh but marines the younkou the worst generation. 
Luffy- He sometimes comes out like another of those shounen cliche heroes but he never lets his crewmates or anyone he cares about  be in danger and manytimes while other pirate captains wouldn't give a damn about the island internal conflicts Luffy will always guarantee that he will beat the main villains ass 
Villians- Now the villains of One piece are like no other each have a reason why they became evil and many times you sympathise with them giving them a whole other dimension which is almost absent in other shonen series 
Art- Now this is controversial post timeskip yes the art has been iffy but that occurs only sometimes the art while not the best i think is still watchable and sometimes episodes are brilliantly animated too  
So overall One piece i think if you watch it you will fall in love it and will look forward to sundays

    I'm not gonna bother with a proper review, you can look through the pages and judge for yourself. 
All I'm gonna say is that before you judge One Piece, see the Japanese Subbed version or at least the Funimation Dub, don't bother with 4Kids unless you want to laugh at it. Everyone will tell you this, so don't do it if it's your first time watching One Piece. 
Also, don't expect One Piece to follow the original plot. Just don't, it won't happen anytime soon.

    The hundred-and-so episodes where Brook's character is introduced. That's why I'm not giving this a 9 or a 10. I hated those episodes with a passion. Everything else? Spectacular.

    I watched some of this when I was younger on cartoon network or something and I'd always disliked it. Now I can see the humor and I can never find pirate anime or manga. I adore pirates and the way One Piece portrays pirates is fun. They have the bad, the plan evil, but most of all it has friendships with in the crew. I think it's very enjoyable even if the art is, well down right bad is what I use to think. However now I can see that it's a kind of unique way to show the characters. Besides I've seen worse.

    This is my favorite show. Say what you want about the pacing and filler arcs that sometimes don't follow the cannon of certain characters by ignoring all that I can honestly say this is the one that tops them all in the current era and there's a reason it's been around for about two whole decades now. Because One Piece is amazing. It takes dreams (a concept that most people grow up to give up on and/or believe are only for kids) and makes you want to give life your best shot to achieve your own. Every main character has a dream and are driven beyond belief to achieve their dreams. The best thing about it is that the characters don't just say ""Hey I'm not going to give up on my dreams no matter what happens!"". They realize that the world they live in is a harsh and dangerous place that won't let anyone realize their dreams unless they go through the trials of life. Kind of like real life. The main characters go through struggles all their lives and sooner or later have to decide if they are going to let the world push them to the curve or stand up and fight for what they want. One Piece is a series that can speak to everyone if they watch and listen hard enough to what is really happening and what the creator of this magnificent show is trying to say. Is this show perfect? Of course not. Every show has flaws just like every person in real life has flaws and One Piece is no exception. However if you are willing to set sail with the Straw Hat Pirates and decide that you want to stick with it until the end rather it be a fairy tail ending or something along the lines of a Greek Tragedy or even something that is bitter sweet, then you're in for the adventure of a life time and all the great and unifying moments along the way.

    Some people hate One Piece I'm just here like why, what's to hate, this seires is an adventurous action packed series that sends you on a rollercoaster with your emotions yes it's long but hey that's the good part you can marathon the heck out of it and just chill plus give the author credit he is probably one of the few mangakaa out there that can manage over a 500 characters not sure if One Piece has over 500 characters but I saw online it has the most characters in jump magazine anyway I love this series I love how the arcs are set up the anime tends to drag it out sometimes, the drop in animation quality is likely due to the amount of episodes an arc has some arcs are short example the old One Piece usually had 25-45 episodes but after the timeskip the episodes for one arc is like 100+ which kills their budget that's why sometimes the animation quality looks like dog shit 😂, the characters are one of the main aspects of One Piece their quriky selves and how Loveable they can be this series is greater than most airing seires if people gave it a chance they'd see that what new animes/mangas are doing this series has already done it in a different way

    One piece is my favorite manga. Probably the one I've been for the longest time. I started animated when I was a kid, I was 9 years old. I was watching with my mother and sister, we were having a good time, until I was 11~12 years old. 
 
I stopped the anime for a year or two, and continued it until episodes 700 where I read the manga. Well, no big differences, but I liked reading manga. Then I wanted to continue following the animated despite everything, but.... I was bored. 
 
I stopped following the anime, but looked at it again later and once the nostalgia was set aside, the animated adaptation was an insult to the manga. I recognize that Oda has the ability to stretch some bows / pass through the manga, except that unlike the Toei he does it well. 
So yes, the Japanese dubbing is good, the ost too, there are very well adapted scenes, especially the moving scenes. But the animation, the slowness of the episodes, it kills One Piece. Toei, how can you adapt a 14-page chapter in 20 minutes? It's impossible without stretching as unnecessarily as you do. Who would it kill to make One Piece an animated in season, like all those currently out there? Who would spit on waiting to have a better adaptation than the current one? No one! No one! 
 
So to sum up, the main flaw of the One Piece animation is its awful slowness, the animation.... Worse than average.... In fact, it's basically the manga with more squares for the same shot, to which we add sound and voice. 
That's the principle of an animate, it's true, but this time it's not done right. 
 
The Wa no series is better, but let's not hide our faces except for a big change of style and an improvement of the animation, there is always this frightening slowness that is omnipresent. It's a little higher than the average, but it doesn't save everything. To be exact, I gave up when Urashima and Luffy gave each other their one-minute palm punch. 
 
Par contre les 914 et 915 ils étaient bien

    Adapted from One Piece manga and heavy intervention from Oda in making this anime, even the music as well, this make One Piece become very enjoyable anime to watch 
 
Story: 8/10 
I would say, my rate of story differs in different arcs. Most of relevant stories deserve 10/10 because of their amazing storyline, however, some arcs can be quite boring and not really relevant to others. In One Piece early period, one episode can comprise of 2 manga chapters which is quite acceptable, but recently the comparison of eipsode:manga become 1:1 instead of 1:2; making the story progression in current anime arcs quite long. Still, it is enjoyable to watch every episode. 
 
Art:10/10 
The art is very nice. Even though some people complained that all of female characters look like Nami/Robin, I dont really see that as a problem. I like how the character expressions are made which can make you really feel how they are feeling (for instance when they are crying). 
 
Sound: 10/10 
Nice sound and fits perfectly with the scenes. The sound can ignite your psychological feeling on what happened (for instance, increasing the sadness feeling in sad scenes) Also, I like the OSTs which are enjoyable to listen most of the times. 
 
Character: 9/10 
I love how the character developments progress everytime. Not only the strawhats, but also other supporting characters in different arcs also experience progression as well (eg: crocodile, jinbe, hacchi, etc) 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
It is very nice to enjoy, however, sometimes the episode title and AMV may spoil on what's going to happen next. Even though, it is still nice though for the anime to extend some scenes which are not really explained in the manga so everything told in the anime become pretty clear enough. 
 
 
Overall: 8/10 
It can be potentially 10/10 but there are blood censorship, slow progress, which is quite annoying. Still it deserves 9/10 overall

    One Piece started airing in 1999 and has been airing non-stop ever since then. It has reached over 700 episodes, and the animation hasn't been top-notch ever since around the time-skip. But, there are better things about One Piece that aren't about the animation and... well, the length of One Piece is the least thing I worry about. If you really like the show, and enjoyed it, like I did, I finished it in around 2 months, and am now bored and don't know what to watch. It's not that I don't know what to, I'm not really motivated to watch anything right now. 
 
Gol D. Roger was known as the Pirate King who was the strongest pirate who ruled the seas. Well, I don't have to explain this, because the page of MAL says it, so explaining it is kind of useless. Although this is the main story, it branches off into several characters stories, who have their own kind of backstory. Luffy's is shown in the first couple of episodes, and re-shown after the Marineford arc, what really happened. Zoro is also shown within the first 20 episodes... well, I ain't sitting here explaining which backstories were shown in which episodes. But, the story keeps on going and going which is my favourite part about One Piece. 
 
The animation and art-style... It ain't the greatest thing in existence. But, unlike other people, I frankly don't give a shit. I franky don't give a shit. Ha! Nah, sorry, I'll kill myself right now. Anyway, I don't care for the animation and art-style as long as the content is still good. I can watch things with not-so-good animation and art-style as long as the story and content of it is good. 
 
The soundtrack is my second favourite thing about One Piece. I think it's second. Well, anyway, I like how a scene you try not to bawl your eyes out in,  and you're succeeding... until.... SAD MUSIC SLASH! Yeah, this is basically what happens. And then they kill you. 
 
The characters, third favourite. I have a lot of favourite things about this anime. I like sometimes how they re-use voice actors for different characters in the series. It's easier than finding new people, so I kind of see why they do this. The character development though, is so good. It makes Boku no- Not the best example, so I won't say anything. 
 
I enjoyed this anime a lot. I didn't start watching it a lot until the Enies Lobby arc (late 200s and early 300s) and it wasn't the greatest series before then. But, after that moment, I started watching the anime a lot, every day even. I ain't a serious anime watcher or reviewer, so I can't judge an anime better than someone that actually lives off of this. But one thing I can say is, this anime is great. If you're planning to watch it, don't stop before at least Arlong Park. If you still don't like it at Arlong Park... well... try to get to Alabasta at least. It's one of the first big arcs, and Alabasta features one of the first main villains to ever appear. So, don't back down from the first couple of episodes. Continue. Continue. Watch it all... 
 
...or just read the manga.

    No single review could ever amount to the magnitude of mixed feelings i've felt watching this anime over the last 12 years, but it's a risk worth making should i only succeed in making this single point crystal clear.  
 
Story: 10/10 
I often ask myself ""What makes a good story?"", but quite interchangeably I now ask ""What makes One Piece's so good?"" - what separates it from everything else, and why would anyone in 2017 commit to the behemoth of episodes?  
Well ... for the most part I don't think many people 'can' watch it. It's my belief that had you joined the roller coaster 18 years ago, it would be much easier to love because this anime certainly hasn't aged well for those without the highest form of patience and it's excruciatingly slow-paced. Yet, returning to my former question what separates it's story is the 'Flow' - and it my belief this is what has made it a masterpiece (Filler & Specials excluded). Sadly, we're seeing less and less emphasis on this basic storytelling technique, as sophisticated plot and characters take the center stage. I've yet to see a new successful action anime without apocalyptic stakes and drama we've all seen many times. The brilliance of One Piece is that the stakes and drama unfolds onto the characters themselves and their friends but never onto the World. As a result the plot is naturally driven by the characters as they frequently react to their needs, wants, loves and desires. New land's call to them, but they have a choice and some of this anime's drama in the beginning revolves around Captain Luffy's leadership but as the anime progresses a group-friendship born from love, tragedy, desperation and forgiveness rises, and with their loyalties - so, too does their Standing (Power) to the World.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
The Captain and First Mate of all Pirate Crews are hierarchical of strength, however to Luffy's Strawhat Pirates the title is mainly a formality, however for the sake of time, i will argue the strongest of the group are reflective of the rest and it's also worth noting that exclusive 'best friends' don't really exist among the Strawhats as their friendship is mutual across the crew. The unique bonds between characters may at times be confused as a character's preference to one another but when boiled down, they treat everyone the same. 
 
Monkey D. Luffy 
To the onlooker, I could understand how Luffy appears as cheesy 'Comical Relief' character and to an extent this is true. In the face of danger that would otherwise strike fear or anger into his peers, he will be remembered by me as the most light-hearted anime character of all time, but also the most wrathful. I see many similarities between Luffy and Goku (DBZ) only Luffy's living in harsh world, forcing a more human/realistic character. For instance in his mistakes and weakness, he'll weep and apologize. There's no coming back from the afterlife, and death leaves it's scars on him . His passion and dream for discovering the One Piece treasure far exceed anyone else in the World, however he wouldn't hesitate to throw it all away if it meant saving a friend. The very little ego he bears is seen in the rare times he must stop being a friend and act like a Captain for the sake of others and his dream.  
 
Roronoa Zoro  
Best defined as the untameable beast with swords, who is indifferent from all his comical friends in his seriousness. I'd once wondered ""Why three swords?"" but this oddity is quickly pardoned by the mastery of his techniques. Ironically he's pretty normal in the world of One Piece and Devil Fruit powers. Again, to ignite perspectives i'd draw as many similarities to differences between Vegeta (DBZ). Pride, separates him from sharing moments with the Crew, and the case is strong for Zoro being more powerful than Luffy, and for what begins as a ""I help you, you help me"" deal between Zoro and Luffy quite slowly turns into a friendship defined by Zoro's actions and never his stubborn words. Character progression is strongest with Zoro 
 
Sound: 3/5 (Excluding Openings and Endings) 
Music throughout does perfectly drive excitement, however these instances come far too rarely and could probably be counted on one hand. It's my belief that those who believe Sound and Art really define good anime are the very cause and death to Creativity in anime, and i can quite easily look past One Piece's under-performing music - though one would do well to note that my standard for 5/5 is one track's 'timelessness' and transgression from anime to communities worldwide (try Shirō Sagisu's - Never Meant to Belong)   
 
Art: 3/5 (Subject to the scrutiny of 2017) - Old art = 2/5 + New art 4/5  
Truly original artistry, however i believe the Story deserves the credit after all it's the catalyst for the artistic flexibility that's  hardly ever allowed by typical plots.  
 
Overall: 25/30 ~ 83/100 ~ B Performance 
To conclude, the anime isn't perfect. 
Many deter from it, or Drop the series by virtue of it's art and slow pacing which are fair considerations to have especially when subscribing to an anime  debated to be only  50% to 80% completed at 700+ episodes. My advice would be against the average viewer attempting it. Many of today's action series run fast towards the cataclysmic conclusion. Only once you get bored of the same recycled plots and character template should you consider the voyage of One Piece.  
 
Everybody searches for an anime that will leave them wanting more, but with One Piece you don't have to wait, but you still need patience :D 
 
Sincerely, 
Willowboy.

    I started watching this series to see what the fuss was all about. I like the premis of the story, the art and the characters (no developements though), but the pacing is awful. Most of the times I skip 5-8 minutes at the beginning of an episodes until the story slowly progresses. I didn't mind that much when there was a good story arc, I just felt sightly annoyed. But now I reached an arc, which is not that engaging to me, so the slow pacing really takes away a lot of the overall enjoyment. It might have been really good, if they had paused once in a while to break it into several seasons à 25 complete episodes. I will continue watching (and skipping half of the episodes+fillers) none the less , because it is fun at times.

    I have been converted into a One Piece fan... there I said it. But that would make for a poor and short review so, let me start off by saying, I hated one piece for many years. I cannot stress enough how much I disliked it.  This wasn't for the usual reasons either like the unusual Art style or the english dub (I haven't heard that since it first aired on toonami when I was a kid). I blame it mainly on the anime just being flat out boring for the first 200 episodes. even the Alabasta arc, which was the first major arc of the series was sub-par at best. I was committed to watching this show though in order to find out what all the fuss was about so I must have re-watched up to the sky island arc over 9 or 10 times but still I couldn't figure it out. Eventually I decided to just power through sky island and i didn't regret it.  I discovered that the greatness that is one piece begins at the ""Water 7"" arc. it is the first time That you can see the characters really come into their own and not just win through luck or  crying really hard. It is at this point that the fights hit that ""Let me find an AMV of that"" kind of level. This is also the point when the artwork goes HD and stops looking like a first grader drawing pirates over a water color.  So aesthetically the anime  becomes much more enjoyable as well. This is especially true when the crew reaches saobody, the artwork becomes absolutely spectacular and you begin to look forward to what amazing scenes you will see next. the Characters are all relatable and the stories can be really difficult to pull your head away from. I will admit though, sometimes the constant crying from the main cast can be a bit too much and their general stupidity can also be a bit trying at times, but beyond that, if you can push through the first 200 episodes, you wont regret it. i would give it a 10/10 but the first bit makes it really hard.

    There is an adventure out there for you, what are you waiting for? Stop sitting in your chair or laying on your bed and watch anime and get out there! It's time to search for One Piece! 
 
One Piece is an adventure show that reference pirates that venture out into the sea looking for treasure and whatnot. When we think about anime, one of the anime we would think would be Naruto, Bleach, Dragon Ball Z; and even Pokemon and Yu-gi-oh. One Piece is up there. The story follows true to the plot and still continue doing so as of the current episode. The artwork is very unique and shounen-like, which is befitting for a shounen manga. Music and sounds are superb as all main characters has a theme of their own. And about every characters has their own kind of mindset, but also share similarities. People who dislike and/or drop the series, probably should have give it another chance because the show only gets better as it continues. I can understand the art can be really different from most common and modern anime these days. I know that there are some anime art that I dislike to, I won't say which though. But otherwise, if you think One Piece is overrated, it shouldn't be because I believe it deserves high rating. But until One Piece has a conclusion, I'll rate it 9/10 for now. Depending on the conclusion at the end, it could drop a rating or perfect the masterpiece. 
 
Story: Modern anime now these days, tend to focus on characters more and what they do instead of having an initial plot line from the start, like Luffy wanting to find the One Piece and become King of the Pirate. At the start, there is a slow, but steady pacing of the show, it gets better as more characters are introduced as Luffy travels out the sea looking for more comrades and fun things to explore. The story stays true and doesn't sway from its' purpose. Probably, because how the plot is, it can easily go on and go making new islands (but consistent, of course), new areas, new seas, new characters, and etc. The author that create One Piece is quite imaginative and innovative. Honestly, I have no complaints about the plot or story line so far. I'm just waiting for the conclusion before I can give it a full rating. 
 
Art: Very shounen for a while, but most recently, a little disappointed. I could swear Nami's breast looks bigger than her initial appearance. Yes, I understand that there is a time skip, but actually, Nami's breast looks bigger before the time skip. In fact, why is about every adult women or so, have ginormous breast. This is something I don't understand because One Piece is technically shounen, which means, meant to aim for little boys around age 6 - 12. What happens to average breast, small breast, and flat (for adult women only)? Also, about every women has an hourglass figure? What?! I'm sorry, it just doesn't make sense even in anime universe. Don't get me wrong, they do have fat women and old women in the show, and ugly ones as well as pretty ones. It just that, it kind of inconsistent to shounen and feels not so unique anymore. Other than the breast issue (again with many of the anime these days), the art style is very shounen-like and when there is a fight scene, you can see it display visually well and fliud. Many of the artwork of islands, monster, animals, some-kind of creature, and human themselves, are usually well design and thought out. 
 
Sound: I'm very lenient when it comes down to anime sounds and music. I like the fact that every of Luffy's crew member has their own distinctive theme and it's very appropriate as well. There are a few Opening that are reused often, kind of like how Hunter x Hunter never change the music opening, which can be either a minus or a plus for you. But other than that, soundtrack are original and used at appropriate moments. 
 
Character: I think this is where One Piece shine the most. All Luffy's crew member has a goal and dream in mind that they wish to pursuit. But more importantly, they all share the same line of goals. Luffy is to be Pirate King, Zoro is to be Master of Swordsman in the world, Nami is to be the Navigator that'll map all location including secrets/undiscovered areas, Usopp is to be the King of Sniper (shooting), Sanji wants to find All Blue, Chopper wants to discover all types of herbs and other ingredients that'll help him discover more hidden medicine, Robin wants to find all poneglyphs, Franky wants to create a ship that'll travel all around world, and Brook simply wants to keep everybody entertain as a purpose of his life. Other than Luffy's crew member, other characters both allies and foes are interesting and has their own purpose to do. 
 
Enjoyment: It's an adventure anime show, what is there to be bored of. Some fillers can be boring, but the main canon story isn't dull.  
 
Overall: One Piece isn't my favorite anime, but it is on my top 10 anime list if I were to list it. If you like adventure and the concept of freedom, you'll see it very often in One Piece. Just like our world, in One Piece, there are racism,    and many other things like govt. conspiracy, politician, what is truly justified or not, and it does play an important role in morality. That being pirates are the ""bad"" people and navy marines are the ""good"" people, but in this anime, you'll see that it's not always simple black and white. There are gray areas and characters can be different from what you would think and expect.

For me, it's a great anime, but of course, like all animes, it has several flaws and stuff that I do not really like. 
The first thing I do not like: It's very entangled, they only need 3 things, it takes 30 to 40 episodes for them to complete. 
The second thing I do not like much: A long time ago I began to realize that the anime / manga began to be ""infantilized"", if I may say so, as before the animation was coarser, nowadays the animation is lighter. 
Now let's talk about the things I love about the play. 
First: Oda has a lot of creativity to create characters, I would never be able to create a single character on my own (of course he does not do it all by himself, but anyway, right?), So much so that I will be inspired by Oda's work to create the game I'm developing. 
Second: If he says that something is super rare, then this thing really will be super rare, example: a zoan myth.

    When I started the early episodes one One Piece, honestly it was a bit of a chore (it took me 150 episodes to actually see the genius taking route in the series). The only reason I kept going was because of my curiosity- there had to be something that made this behemoth of a series so successful and enabled it to go on for so damn long! 
 
And there definitely is, it's just a   matter of whether the payoff is worth the extremely large investment, and whether you're willing to dive into an ongoing 750+ episode anime packed with not entirely original content that's already been done before, seen before and displayed with much more visually impressive and compact  Shounen series like My Hero Academia, Nanatsu no Taizai & Magi. 
 
Personally, I'd say yes it most definitely is, but not for the reasons you'd initially want or suspect. 
 
Despite being a battle Shounen, the fights in One Piece are somewhat lacking in creativity and excitement. Which is ironic, because the world of the series is outrageous; many of the abilities outlandish and downright bizarre- I mean the protagonist is literally made of rubber.  
 
But good lord, do not watch this series if you want insane fights and balls to the walls action because the anime does not bring it to the table...aside from maybe a few times. The animation plays a huge part in that though and honestly I'm torn on how to rate it- because sure, there are a lot of lazy parts & tons of still frames during fights, but the color palette is bold and the character designs are just zaney as hell. Most notably the antagonists who somehow manage to look equal parts ridiculous and intimidating; the charactarizaton is nothing to scoff at. 
 
So I'll cut One Piece a little slack- it has been airing continuously for nearly my entire life span! 
 
However menacing that statement seems, it also means that One Piece has over 800 named characters, all playing some role in their respective arcs. With such a large cast, it's impossible to not find hundreds of them endearing! The only problem being that they almost always never get enough spotlight because the plot of One Piece NEVER STOPS MOVING. 
Love that new character? Don't get too attached because you probably won't see them again for another 300 episodes! 
 
The main characters go from island to island to island to island, which makes sense because they're an infamous pirate crew with a thirst for adventure...but sometimes the story needs to just take a breather, and so do I. 
So many things are going on with so many different characters in different places, that One Piece has developed this terrible habit of jumping about frequently, simultaneously making me want to both slow down & speed up the damn thing. Confusing, I know! 
 
Despite this, with so many arcs, sub-plots and backstories, there's a lot of good content to sink your teeth into. 
After all, One Piece isn't afraid to step away from its main characters unlike many other series of the same genre, and that's something I can't help but admire. We delve into the pasts, plans and aspirations of many side characters, as well as the history of the world of the series itself and whilst it may not always be done to a T, it does a damn good job trying.  
 
Nobody is irrelevant in the story however small their role might seem. The true appeal of One Piece doesn't come from action or cool fights, but rather from affairs happening in the background or the possibility of exciting future events. 
 
Really, watching One Piece is like watching somebody building a mansion from start to finish. It starts with such a basic concept,  but before you know it you're tangled up in this huge web that never stops spinning, and One Piece is definitely one big web. 
 
The characters  are treated much the same way- simple, yet suddenly not. Now,  One Piece is not an introspective series by any stretch of the imagination (just look at Luffy, the representative and heart of the story) but it is not one where characters are good or evil, black or white. Yes, some are more good than others and some innately more cruel...but most of the characters do good and do bad, and I think that makes them instantly more likable and relatable. The development of the characters might not be great, but the fact that they're greatly flawed makes up for that most (not all) of the time. 
 
The world-building however, is consistently impressive. With it's own intricate political system and flourishing world, it's not difficult to find  One Piece's setting astounding, and the amount of creative genius that's poured into it's fictituous world is nothing short of admirable. 
 
One Piece isn't always great- some arcs flop, some go on too long, character gimmicks can be grating and half the main cast disappear for episodes on end, but when the series shines, it shines bright.  
 
And to me,  a series is pretty damn magical when you can roll with its flaws and still love the hell out of it. One Piece is a journey of numerous ups and downs where you can't have the good without the bad; individual taste dictates whether it's worth the investment.

    ``You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything in one place! Now you just have to find it!`` - Gol D. Roger. 
  
For an anime having literally almost 1000 episodes and still ongoing to be enjoyable, I don't even know what I can say. This anime is literal gold, I have never seen anything like it and everything about it is just amazing. Well, except the timeskip. 
 
STORY - 10:  
Gol D. Roger, the King of the Pirates obtained this and everything else the world had to offer, and his last dying words drove countless souls to the sea. ''You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything in one place! Now you just have to find it! - Gol D. Roger.'' Those words that the Pirate King spoke, started an era. An era that would change the world as we knew it. 20 years later, Monkey D. Luffy, a 17 year old who ate the cursed ''Devil Fruit'' which gives amazing powers but the disability to swim, has a love for adventure, and strives to become a pirate because of his inspiration, a pirate named Shanks. Shanks taught Luffy everything, and even sacrificed his arm for Luffy when he was a young child. Young Luffy then realised the dangers of the sea, and Shanks gave him his trademark Straw Hat and made a promise to Luffy so he could bring it back when Luffy becomes a great pirate. Heading back to the present, Luffy sets off in a mini-boat, and encounters new friends, powerful foes with the powers of the Devil Fruit, amazing islands and becomes stronger along with his crew-mates to find the legendary treasure left behind by the Pirate King... The ONE PIECE! 
 
ART - 6: 
For the first 500 episodes, One Piece's art was incredible, despite the animation (movements) were little to average. Despite that, I believe the character designs are extremely creative and that Oda was thinking right when drawing them, not saying it's bad but I believe it's not as good as other anime I've seen. 
 
SOUND - 10: 
Oh god, the music of One Piece is amazing. It just captures every moment, from the struggles, the sadness, the pain, the danger, the fun, you can feel how it is for the character's. Honestly, if One Piece had another soundtrack, it just wouldn't match the sense of adventure it is. 
 
CHARACTER - 10: 
I don't even need to say anything for this, watch the anime yourself. Each and every one of them are something else. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 10: 
The first 516 episodes were one of the best episodes I've seen for any series I've seen in a long time.

    Undoubtedly one of my favourite animes of all time! The way the anime started and how the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and his crew become these unique pirates who usually solve every problem while trying to the the Pirate King is just super addictive. 
 
The best part about One Piece is the suspense maintained! The reveals are perfect for every character! The fans and the audience know what they want to know like ""What is One Piece?"", ""What is 'D'?"", ""What is the secret of the Poneglyphs?"", ""What are the three strongest weapons?"" so on and so forth. Some might complain that the anime is going too long but One Piece will always be the biggest and the best adventure by a Crew! 
 
Eichiro Oda has given the fans so much to look forward to! I want to know the end but I dont want the series to end! Nostalgic! 
 
Happy Watching!

    I am bias. Though, it is a bias in a weird way. On one hand, One Piece is one of my favourite series, (so much so that I have a podcast surrounding it - channel is linked on my profile if you're interested) but on the other hand I can barely force myself to watch 20 minutes of this show at a time. 
 
The manga One Piece is no.1 in popularity/sales world wide, though most of those sales do come from japan itself. There is good reason for this, the world of One Piece is densely populated, energetic, and memorable, but this is all because of the superb writing of the manga. The anime is able to produce a similar effect albeit at the pace of an amusement park line but that is only because of the writing it adapts. The fact of the matter is that 90% of the time One Piece fails as an adaptation. There are countless moments where the impact of a scene is neutered due to either horribly off-model art, stunted (or even no) animation or incredibly long cuts. 
 
If you're looking to get into one piece and you want to see if its for you then I would still urge you to start with the anime as its main problem is its pacing which begins after the first Saga (after ep 50). It actually starts with the pretty desirable pace of 2-3 chapters an episode. The early anime feels energetic and alive because of this. After this saga though it becomes something entirely different, getting through the show between ep. 60ish- 240ish is hard without having a filler guide handy. The pacing becomes much worse after filler arc become a thing of the past. Instead of creating non-canon content the team at Toei decided to eventually do away with that and opt into stretching the canon content, a choice which has completely destroyed this shows quality. 
 
Putting pacing aside, what can I say about the sound design? The music is top quality, specifically some of the more somber songs used earlier on, I'll often find myself revisiting many songs. More recent addition, although still being well produced don't quite fit the world which is so important to one piece. What worst of all is Toei's stock sound effects, which seem to have been reused from Dragon Ball much of the time. 
 
As for the art and animation, it's hard to really come to a solid conclusion on this. Its up and it down, its hot and it cold, it's yes then its no. Seriously, there are long bouts of nearly unanimated scenes with off-model characters occupying the foreground which is extremely jarring. The thing is, when the anime decides to look good it really looks good. Some of the scenes are have become some of my favourite pieces of animation but they're so spread out amongst the mountains of garbage that its hard to really give praise to the animation with out first insulting it. 
 
At its core though, this still is one piece. What you can expect is some powerful emotional moments and strong character writing, fun adventures, and unique character designs, and a living world just asking to be dived into. The series is filled with large and small scale mysteries and history, all of which is handled masterfully and with care. When doing through one piece for the first time it feels dynamic and different. As the series continues it shows that nearly any plot which has arisen will meet a satisfying end. It's a series which I couldn't recommend more, but in the anime's case is done so poorly. 
 
I N   C O N C L U S I O N 
if you enjoy battle shonen stories then this is my must attempt. It is no.1 for good reason, but the anime is just not the right way to go about it. Watch those first 50 or so episodes then switch to the manga. It's a much better use of you time and if you wanna see a scene animated that badly, you could always find a clip of the important scenes. 
 
All things considered, 7/10 if you really only wanna watch the anime you should get around to it eventually.

    Three complaints I hear from people about One Piece is A) it's too long! Of course, it's going to be long, this series is about 20 years old - that's the same age as me and considering how popular it is in especially in Japan, it's not a surprise that the anime has 800+ episodes with a manga almost at 1000 chapters. The fact it's still a top dog after both Naruto and Bleach ended while stories like Fairy Tail are crashing and burning, shows how much more depth there is to this series. 
 
So some advice - who said you had to watch all of it in one sitting? Watch it arc by arc whenever you feel like it. Enjoy it. If you want something to watch for the laughs - WATCH ONE PIECE.  
 
B) Weird art style. Something I never understood is people thinking One Piece is weird looking. I find it refreshing because of how unique it is. Actually rather than unique, it's more like it doesn't follow the anime style stereotype even within a shounen series which makes it stand out in terms of design. 
 
Advice - if the art style bugs you to the point you can't concentrate on the series, stop watching it. I have seen many series where the art style was not my favorite but I watched it anyway because I enjoyed the series.  If the story captivates you enough, eventually the art won't matter to you anymore.""Kingdom"" was one such series for me. 
 
C) The English dub sucks. Okay first off, who said you had to listen to it in dubbed? Second, the Funimation version is better and follows the original without changing anything, unlike the 4kids dub. Third I tend to prefer dubs because I can multitask while I'm watching since I have no subtitles to read. Also since it is a long series and I read the manga as well, I watch the anime whenever the dubbed arcs come out. This way I get a break in between and don't feel overwhelmed with the series. Plus, I enjoy watching the fight scenes animated. 
 
Advice - if you enjoy dubbed watch it in dubbed if you like subbed than watch it in its original version. Also, many dubs have been really well made - even better than the original like FMA/B and DBZ. So don't rule a dub out just because you think dubs suck. 
 
Now time for my thoughts on the series: 
 
One must appreciate the complexity of this anime. I mean many shows are good with just 25 episodes but were not talking about simply defeating the bad guy or achieving a dream, this show is about Pirates having adventures. This means that the end goal doesn't really matter, it's about the journey and when you're creating the world around travel, that means you have to be able to have enough material to create unique characters, islands and somehow make it seem like all of these adventures are connected with one another to the main story plot- i.e. Luffy becoming the Pirate King. That's not an easy task and Oda has preplanned this series so far in advance that things that appear trivial in one arc become really important later on. Like ""Thriller Bark"" when we meet Brook, the 9th member. We assume it's just adding another crewmate but this one arc had Easter eggs connecting to the current arc in the series dealing with the ""Four Pirate Emperors"". That's key because one of the biggest complaints I have heard about Fairy Tail as a series is the missing plot points. In terms of foreshadowing skills and using flashbacks, One Piece has it in the bag. 
 
Complaint D) is the pacing is slow in the beginning. Which is true but that's so each character has a foundation - the Straw Hats don't just take any random member, each crew member has a specific role within the ship, they are fundamental to the stories progression so they need to be flushed out, we aren't talking about fodder characters like in every other pirate crew.   
 
The show also explores the dichotomous relationship between Pirates and Marines and that they're not as black and white as we think they are. As the world and characters are flushed out we see that there are some major problems and it just so happens that the Straw Hats are always in the middle of it.  
 
This series talks about a lot of complicated topics but in a light-hearted way that makes you not take the anime too seriously but understanding that there is a lot of depth behind it. Some examples of tough topics explored are domestic abuse, human slavery/trafficking, discrimination,  & classism.    
 
In terms of world building the anime is fantastic - there are a few filler arcs but compared to Naruto, they are nothing, 98% is canon.  
 
Music wise it's quite catchy and has a fun loving tone that makes you excited to see the crews adventures. 
 
Character wise it has some of the most well-rounded characters in a series, even for side characters, considering it has such a large cast, that's quite impressive :D - long running series like Naruto failed to do that which is sad considering most of the series was located within the Leaf village. [Don't get me wrong I'm a Naruto fan but I am not afraid to admit it has its faults] 
 
One Piece is a series that's full of surprises - aka. I found Sanji annoying and dismissed his character as a total flirt - current arc within the series, I adore him. Very few series has made me change my mind on a character especially this deep in. You will find many characters to love or hate - I'm looking at you Akainui - but that's what makes this such an entertaining series to watch.  
 
In terms of Shonen series, I would say One Piece is one of the most well-developed stories out there and would tell anyone to give it at least a shot. The series may surprise you. 
 
Also to those that hate when a character is only ever OP, in One Piece these characters do struggle and they do lose. And characters do actually die without any of that Dragon Ball Z they all keep coming back to life bullshit. Again love the series but people find Fairy Tail characters not seeming to be able to die annoying while I find even when DBZ characters die they just come back to life like it never even happened.

    Review 29: One Piece (Yay Gum Gum fruit)!!!! 
 
A Worldwide favourite, but i only have one question, is there actually an anime out there that can take this one off of the shelves in over 1000 different countries?? I think not. 
 
Meet the clinicaly insane straw hatted pirates, that always seem to get their own way..... One Piece is a world wide famous anime and manga series to little five year olds, too 60 year olds who still remember the series from a while back. The series is packed with food, fighting, rather confusing moments and really (and i emphasis really) weird looking pirate maniacs that will do anything to get the one piece and the devil (gum gum) fruit. 
 
The main story in the series... well when i say main story i mean the overall series.... is supposed to about a young high pitched, squeaky voiced boy named Monket D.Luffy finding the one Piece to eventually become the King of Pirates like in ancient myths and legands. One problem though, he doesn't even have a ship, never mind a crew. And due to his young age no other pirates take him seriously even though he's trying to do them all a favour by helping them get to the One Piece and becoming the new King of the Pirates with them in his crew.  
 
The only time people or pirates usually take him serious, this keeps up through out the whole series of One Piece, is when he shows his what he calls his ""Gum, Gum Abbilities""... So to us this will be the devil fruit powers. When a devil fruit is consumed and depending on which type you have consumed then special un'realistic powers are released that you may or may not be able to control depending on how mature and smart you are.In this case Luffy has consumed a rare Devil Fruit that gives the consumer to extend parts of his of hers bodies to unbelievable lengths, and when punched the punches fly right off of his body or when shot at the rubber sends them flying back at the opponent. So basically we have a weird boy with an even weirder rubber body..... 
 
The series is based in another and slightly older fashioned world where pirates, thieves, bounty hunters and other strange peope all exisist mainly to defeat pirates but also to keep order in the world, stop wars between other countries and are also mainly here to stop pirates from over taking other towns and cities like they have done in the past and when we watch the series we get to see the over taking of many cities and towns happening right before our straw hatted and clinically insane pirates. 
 
The main character (as we have already established) is Luffy, his main goal in life is to be like Gol D. Roger. He was in fact the previous Pirate king and created the One PIece, a treasure that most normal people think is fake and is a disgrace to their world. Others like Luffy (and some others) Who have realised that if they obtain the One Piece they will be the next Pirate King, and as soon as news about a new pirate king starts to spread many more people will believe in the legand, which then means more fights and violence for Luffy and his soon to be crew. Everyone in the crew is human, well to an extent anyways.......... 
 
Monkey D. Luffy; Our main and insane character for the One Piece series. he's the leader of the straw hat pirates and has an extremely strange fighting style that stands out to the younger generation of anime watchers and lovers. His fighting style is unique but funny, this adds to the genre of the show which is of course a comedy. As his body strecthes to these unbelievable lengths and his body can also deflect damage from opponents it adds humour to any fight that he's in which means that if your reading the manga the reader can relax as they know that he'll never be in any real danger, when watching the anime we can sense some danger in a few situations but nothing to serious to make the watcher hang on to the edge of their seat as they are worried for him. He's a fun loving boy who doesn't really see the seriousness of fighting or being a pirate until other members start joining the crew. He doesn't really care what other people think of him or what other pirates think of him and his crew, the only time he will care is when a pirate or human hurts on of his crew members or damages his ship. He isn't the type of person to start a fight for no particular reason and usually thinks things through when it comes to fighting, when it comes to his friends and every day life he turns a little bit stupid, the stereo typical type of person for an anime like this and as he is in fact the lead character it means all other characters are also laid back, relaxed and at times can be as stupid as him. 
 
The crew eventually becomes huge, one of the first members to be the fearfull Roronoa Zoro..... A three bladed samurai, he was born to kill and to assinate anyone who gets in his way. Luffy managed to get him to join as Zoro had already been captured by the authorities and was tidied up to a pole, he hadn't eaten in a while so Luffy had amanged to taunt him with food and bribe him by setting him free on one condition....... He joined Luffy's crew, even though at this point he didn't even have a ship.  
 
The recruitment for the other members also covers the same sort of method, Luffy makes a deal with them as long as they join his crew. As i said eventually there are quite a  few members that join the crew, some hate Luffy as he's way too hyper and some admire his dreams and goals in life to become the next king of the Pirates. we see new and old characters that Luffy has encountered through the series joining the Crew once they get to know him a bit better, like Nami we see her in the firs episode of One Piece and the audience expects her to join the crew straight away but it takes a while as she follows them around and then decides to join, and there are others who we only encounter a bit further on in the series like Brook, Sanji, Usopp, Nico  Robin, Franky..... And if you haven't even watched the series even once then you still might of heard of little Tony Tony Chopper!! 
 
All in all the series is amazing, i've only seen parts of the series and little snipits but it's still an amazing series! Only theres one little problem, the begininning of the series graphics seem out of date, and when we see the latest episodes the beginning ones don't quite fit in. But apart from this the series is amazing and is a must watch, it's famous world wide and has captured the hearts and minds of millions of anime and manga lovers!!

     One Piece is the best! At first I hated the art but I was up for any new anime shows because I seen alot and I'm very picky about what I watch. So I suggested you watch this do Not I mean Not watch the DUBBED ones it better to just watch the orignal subbed ones instead. You can if you want to but I'm just warning you don't watch the english ones.

    basically this is not some cute girls type anime People watch these (shit).The story is good,emotional,and teaches about friendship by far the best possible way. epic action's epic battles, just the right amount of humour that never gets you bored. there are some episodes which wil disappoint but that is a problem in every anime!!. so watch it or your missing out on a great ANIME! 
made it short so more people actually read it THX

    Lemme say this first, I watched over 100 anime, almost all the main streams and out of all them I gotta say that this right here, One Piece, it the greatest I have watched by far. Here's the review 
 
Story - The author really knows what hes doing. The main character Luffy, is a rubber human after eating the gomu gomu no mi. His goal is to become the Pirate King so he sails out of his small home village to pursue his dream meeting many people on the way, some that become his friends, and some that join his crew. Luffy although stupid, he knows how to tell you everything with just his fist. I don't how the author did it, but the way he makes luffy express certain things in few words and simple actions. Although he is an idiot, hes a genius in the way he is. His entire crew all join with a similar goal in life all linked to luffy's may it be to sail the whole world, make a map of the whole world, or discover what hasn't been discovered. Another thing they do great in this anime is foreshadowing, things from the first few episodes can come around again 500 episodes later. They explain a lot of things, and when you forget about them they bring it back. They constantly hint at the Will of D, Luffy's father, Luffy's brother, as well as what one piece REALLY is, and how everyone is connected to it. This is the only anime that can make me shed tears over and over.600 episodes out and it still hasn't gotten dull, virtually no fillers, and still a bunch of story left to be told. It's a huge world with different species, races, discoveries. 
 
Art - the Art is not the best, it's a unique style and many people hate on it. Unlike a majority of anime that fail to realize that there are many different looking people in the world, and in the world of one piece there are even more different looking people, ugly, deformed, strange, attractive, large, small, they are all drawn in their own way. The author is an artist and can draw bleach like drawing but doesn't, its not like he cant. What I really like about this drawing is the way it can express emotion. If you look at luffy angry, you feel it, you feel the intensity of his angry, its like you wanna punch your screen just as hard you wanna punch the villain in the face. 
 
Sound - The music is good, very pirate like if i were to describe it. Each crew member have their own theme song that match their personality well. They know how to make situations sound good using the music. 
 
Characters - Well developed, all though they look like a happy bunch now but each member has their own dark past, all of them been through a lot and almost all of the back stories will stab you in the heart and make you cry for them. It's because of their past that they have such a respect for luffy, the one that understands them and can bring out their good sides as well as vanquish their bad. 
 
Enjoyment - Very enjoyable, being a beautifully made comedy and action anime it can make you feel the intensity of battle while also making you laugh. It has a lot of drama and sad stories so it's not always all laughs. 
 
Overall - 9/10 The beginning is bad and childish but as the audience got older so does the content, you have to tolerate the first few episodes, they are just introductions, it gets way better. Stable story with a lot left to uncover.

    I used to love this anime, it is actually what started me of on anime and manga. It had everything I needed at the time: something that will go on for a while, thus a story I can follow without getting to the ending to fast. Comedy, drama, action, tragedy and fantasy. 
Sadly the anime does not seem to stay as true to the manga as it once did, from 200 and forward the quality of the anime starts to drop. In a sad way to keep the anime at the right pace, the animators start to alter the parts of the ""journey"" to draw out the episodes and sadly most of the time they make the characters act like idiots, doing things that their manga counterparts realized was stupid or just never did. Like doing the same thing to an enemy multiple times without effect, or fighting an incredibly much weaker character and still having a hard time, even though it usually ended in an instant in the original work. The fillers are usually boring with mediocre characters being introduced constantly to never be heard of again and weirdly tied into an altered story to fit. The series being so long also seems to affect the studios that work on it and its directors, which becomes highly noticeable when the art turns into a weird copy of Naruto art with simplified character drawings and repetetive scenes. Honestly after having a 3 minute intro, a 1 minute summary of overall series plot and then a 5-8 minute previous episode summary, you are left with 15 minutes of ""new"" where in some episodes half of it is reused scenes from 3 minutes ago or from the previous episode.  
 
So the point I am doing is: it is a good series, but the anime does no longer do it justice. So if you ever feel like the story and characters are starting to feel stale, you should probably dip into the manga, many of the repetetive scenes are not in it, and the art does not look like it got simplified over the years, but rather more polished. Though keep in mind that some episodes are actually original works of the author not included in the manga, they are usually good but they never get tied into the story so there is no problem missing it either.

    I have seen the great shonen anime. Naruto, roughly 90 episodes and i left by bored. Bleach, however, loved it, but history is not great and strong. HxH, which is one of the best animes I've seen in my life. In One Piece, I cried, I laughed. Many of my favorite characters are anime One Piece (Rayleigh, Shanks) for their ways of thinking and appearances. Luffy's band is fantastic, all the characters you take them affection. What I'm getting at is that many chapters have, that should not throw you back. For many chapters have and although the beginning is very weak, over time, it repays the time spent.

    The story of One Piece is interesting and sometimes engaging. The art is not really appealing and could use major improvements. The sound is not really special or catchy. There are very few songs that will make you cry or jump out of your seat. The characters in the East Blue arc have really heartbreaking and solid background stories. I like how all of them have goals that they want to accomplish. It is nice to see a group of characters with different goals, but overall the same purpose. Which is to help Monkey D. Luffy become the pirate king. Sadly, with all this said I'm still disappointed. I do not like how the characters are just brushed over and there is no expansion on their foundational stories. It feels like they are introduced, their stories are told, and then immediately cast aside as side characters. I would like to see them develop more and actually see the progress they each made to fulfilling their goals.

    To be honest my score should not be taken too seriously because most of the 10s are what I give for the manga. Overall the anime is great, but it really is way bad compare to the manga. 
 
The story, if regardless most movies, no doubt will be 10/10. The way how it took off my personality mask and touched me is great indeed, when Usopp Pirates disbanded, when Hiluluk laughed about his coming death, when Saul told Robin nobody is born to be lonely, when Coby stopped Sakazuki and trying to protect the rest of the marine soldiers, when Kyros was holding Scarlett's body and crying for his helplessness, when Corazon put Law in that treasure box and guarded him until his last moment, when Senor Pink traded his dignity in exchange of Russian's smile, when minks guarded Raizo with all of their lives with a honor, when Pudding made her choice with Sanji, probably the man who would love her more than any other man in the world, and the man she may never seen again... I do not know who would stonefacing these scenes. 
 
The art... I have to say almost all good looking characters are looking the same, but from little bit this, and a little bit of that, we could effortlessly tell who they are.  
 
The sound track, I did not continously watching it except major fight and some episodes because the pace is just so sluggish that I felt it is torturing me. But I do found Luffy Moukou and The Very, Very, Very Strongest being my favorite.  
 
Characters are quite spread in the story, so I guess it kinda equal to it 
 
I would say I enjoyed the series... 
 
Man I just hate writing too much words... Overall it is my favorite show along with Jojo, Seven deadly sins, Yugiohs, dumb funny animes, and other animes that I am too lazy to provide names... Only reason that the anime receives a 6 is because its sluggish pace...... by the time Luffy had his first fight with Kaido, he probably already became the pirate king in the manga...... 
 
If you found my score really low, do not blame me, blame Toei.

    This show was a masterpiece up until the underwater island . I definitely encourage you to see it for up to episode 750 i guess (so around 250 hours) of quality anime with incredibly awesome character development and back story. Afterwards the show reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly slow down . each episode now contain the minimum ""content"" you can put into an episode. However if you can read the manga unlike me , you will have all the fun. 
 
The anime Arc system is one of the best , because each island is like an arc (more of a level) . each island got the same idea of progress , which sound boring but is extremely fun . Every here and there he is collecting a crew member some are better than other (as for you the viewer) .  
 
Art style back then is kinda shitty because it was made in 1999 now its ... more shitty but in HD . As i said , you will be faced with an awesome anime that will sadly loose its brightness .  
 
Mostly if you wanna know why I recommend this it will be because of emotions this anime give you . in each backstory you will cry , in most arcs you will cry . both of sadness and joy

    this is one of the best animes it has alot of stories derived from many legends and characters that are also taken from iconic people and the plot twist are just awesome and thought through ,and it has alot of unanswered questions though it is in 800+ episodes but the stories and the why they are told is really satisfying and feels great but one thing that most viewers must understand about this anime is that it is ok to skip some fillers episodes maybe come back to them later if you want but i remember when i started watching this anime there where about 643 episodes i only watch this anime for month to 2 months tho i didn't skip most of the episodes but you could do that.  
 
so this is my only complain: 
 
one piece is the greatest anime in the story ,character design and plot twists but the only ccomplain i have is that it has alot of fillers alot of episodes that is there just to add the num er of episode side tracking some times it take 4 episode for some one to do something that we all are waiting for and is just like moving 1 inch to open the door for example which is frustrating . 
 
 
so if they make an version with out that bullshit that will be great ... 
 
WOULD I RECOMMEND IT : 
 
YES, of course you woukld be missing out alot of stuff that you would never get from hundreds of thousands of any other anime episodes.... BUT, i encourage you to SKIP EPISODES WHEN THEY ARE JUST FILLERS , there are many websites which tell you if this episode is a canon episode or just  another filler .

     Probably would be a 10/10 if Toei didn't butcher the animation and pacing after the time skip. However, those first 500 episodes were still nearly perfect in every way. Hilarious characters, imaginative worlds and settings, and my favorite aspect of the show is how well each island, character, arc, etc. connects to the overall story. There's almost a sense that everything in the One Piece universe is connected somehow, through the insane amount of characters, or through the crazy vast lands these characters explore. Amazing show (up until timeskip), would watch again. Now since I can't leave a short review have some text art.

    *A few spoilers ahead  
 
One piece is truly an energetic, exciting and binge-worthy anime. The animation has improved. I rewatched some episodes from the beginning and it interesting to see how sharp and clear the animation became.  
 
 The characters have grown a lot throughout the years and the viewers are able to see their progression in their abilities and maturity. The original seven crew members are the best in terms of strength. Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are the strongest, then Franky, Robin and Chopper, and then Brook, Nami and Usopp (the weakest). Additionally, I feel the series was better in the beginning.The attack against CP9, the Alabasta Arc, the fight on Fishmans' Island, the fight against Gecko Moria and the Sky Island has brought the Strawhats closer, and then being separated for two years allowed for their development.  Getting to know each character and their tragic pasts made the story much stronger. The return of many important characters won't list them here happens past 700.  Luckily, we know that Jimbei may or may not be joining the Strawhat crew. 
 
he last two hundred episodes were a bit exhausting. It's the same thing over and over where Luffy fights a strong character and almost gets destroyed but then wins. My least favorite character would probably have to be Usopp. He provided no support or backup the whole time on Dressrosa and all he did was scream for backup. His character development hasn't many any strides since the first 300 episodes it feels like.  
 
 There are some surprising elements that I feel made the story less tight recently. Usually the story is more tight.  It was shocking that the whole crew didn't attack Big Mom's Island - instead Luffy took Nami, Brook and Chopper who aren't the strongest. Zoro should have been there along with Franky.  Also, the fact that Sanji was related to the ""elite"" Vinsmoke family should have been made much more prominent at the beginning. I just feel that the story is a bit unraveling and isn't as concise as it used to be.  
 
Overall, I've fully enjoyed watching One Piece since middle school. It has stayed with me for a really long time and I still feel attached to the story. I was surprised to hear that the anime has no future ""end"" yet though I'm glad I can keep watching it for awhile now.

    Still a masterpiece! One Piece till this day remains consistent with its core appeal. The amazing characters, the heart of the story, the fantastic animation and heart wrenching plot twists. I don't know where i'd be without One Piece. No other long running animation has stayed so true to its fanbase and provided the world-building and momentum to remain relevant. I've gone on so many adventures with the Straw Hats, no matter their heart break I've been with them to watch their resolve, growth and friendship.  
 
It's never too late to start One Piece, once you start you'll get to the most recent episode in no time at all, and you'll be screaming for the next episode like all the other weekly watchers. One Piece is a journey worth taking and I assure you, it doesn't feel long enough.

    Oh, dear...<3<3<3<3 ABSOLUTE TOP! 
I was keeping from this anime as much as I could and since my friends who was in these OP theme always insisted on watching this, i always said NO THANKS NO NO GO AWAY BYE. And here we go in August when I started watching these.. the first mby 20 episodes I was vomiting, I could not even get the point of it, but my friend said CONTINUE, ONE mORE EPISODE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE!!! And I've fallen - the arc about Sanji was the first when I laughed and cried myself out, the second one was with little tanuki and then it started - I was dying to see every episode! And now it's November, 2 and I finished the episode 811. It was 2,5 month of full joy and love, I now understand why OP is in absolute TOP in Japan.. this is a story of smth you will never see in other anime.. this is a soul, a heart, the feelings and this is a deep breath of fresh air. I still wonder how anime that airs 20 years (!!!) IS STILL SO POP AND ORIGINAL, how it hasnt lost its potential, how abroad the imagination of the mangaka. I hope it wil air more and more and more. I just wann say that OP is not the anime...It is WORLD, world where you wish you could live <333 STRONGLY WORTHY OF WATCHING!

    I started watching one piece about a year ago and I caught up very quickly.  
 
Art: So I love this story and it is well written. Although I agree with many people about the art. See wano has GREAT art but now kinda shitty animation however in contrast the pre-time skip era had GREAT animation but shitty art.  And yes I am aware that none of this is oda's fault, it's toei's. See the manga art gets a 10/10 but toei is toei so they ruin it. 
 
Story: Ahh yes the single longest story I have every had the fortune to read/watch. (Very minor spoilers) After Luffy eats the devil fruit an embarks on his quest I was hooked. The imagination that it must have taken to make this story amazing and I love the diversity of the world and characters. It's very rare that one piece is boring and it usually has me one the edge of my seat just waiting to see what happens next. From alabsata to dressrosa to fishman island it has a variety of villains and yet Luffy and crew almost always win. I love this story! I will say however there was one arc I was not fond of and that was Punk Hazard. I found that arc boring and bland but aside from that one arc it is great.  
 
Characters: Well where do I start? There are thousands in this anime. There are just so many and they are all so different. Many of the side characters could each have their own manga or anime. A short(ish) one yes but their own. I think that alone says how great they are. If shanks were to have his own manga then I would be reading that thing so fast you'd think I was the flash. Or if ace or sabo or whitebread or maybe vivi.   
 
Enjoyment: I think at this point you can tell I very much enjoy this 
 
Overall: I highly recommend.

    One Piece is about chasing your dreams and leaving all doubts behind and enjoying life while making new friends saying bye to others and overall living your life to the fullest 
 
𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐲 𝐃. 𝐋𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐲 is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the paternal grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of late ""Fire Fist"" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. Luffy is a pirate and his lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. He has eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which gives the consumer's body the properties of rubber. As the founder and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, he is the first member of the crew, as well as one of its top three fighters. 
 
𝐑𝐨𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐚 𝐙𝐨𝐫𝐨, also known as ""Pirate Hunter"" Zoro, is a pirate and a former bounty hunter. 
 
He was the first member to join the Straw Hat Pirates, and, to date, is considered the largest threat and most dangerous member in the crew after Luffy. His fame as a master swordsman and his great strength, along with the actions of his captain, sometimes led others to believe he was the true captain of the crew. 
 
He is one of the top three fighters in the crew alongside Luffy and Sanji, and his dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world. Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the ""Worst Generation"" (formerly known as the ""Eleven Supernovas"".) He currently has a bounty of Beli320,000,000. 
 
""𝐂𝐚𝐭 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐫"" 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐢 is a pirate and the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates. She was the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town Arc. 
 
She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats in order to rob them for her real crew, but joined the Straw Hats for real after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. She currently has a bounty of Beli66,000,000 
 
""𝐆𝐨𝐝"" 𝐔𝐬𝐨𝐩𝐩 is a pirate and is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. When Usopp was first introduced, he was often (comically) labeled as the ""Liar"" of the Straw Hat Pirates, due to the ""Uso"" (うそ) in his name meaning ""lie"" or ""falsehood"" (嘘). He was born in Syrup Village, and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father. 
 
He was officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join, and, including Nami and Robin, also the third to rejoin, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. His original bounty of Beli30,000,000 was credited to his alias and alter-ego ""Sogeking"". 
 
𝐕𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐦𝐨𝐤𝐞 𝐒𝐚𝐧𝐣𝐢, most commonly known by his moniker ""Black Leg"" Sanji, is a pirate and the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the former sous chef of the Baratie. He is also the third son of the Vinsmoke Family, thus making him a prince of the Germa Kingdom, until he officially denounced them once again. 
 
He is officially the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc. Since he was born in North Blue, he is the first Straw Hat not to originate from East Blue. He is one of the Monster Trio in the crew, alongside Luffy and Zoro. 
 
His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He has a bounty of Beli177,000,000, which is only valid if captured alive, per the request of his father. 
 
𝐓𝐨𝐧𝐲 𝐓𝐨𝐧𝐲 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐫, also known as ""Cotton Candy Lover"" Chopper, is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi which is a devil fruit that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid or a human at will. He came from Drum Island where he learned how to be a doctor, which also makes him the only member of the Straw Hats who was born on the Grand Line. 
 
He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join Luffy, as well as being the youngest member on board. He has a bounty of Beli100 due to being mistaken for the crew's pet. 
 
𝐍𝐢𝐜𝐨 𝐑𝐨𝐛𝐢𝐧, also known by her epithet ""Devil Child"" and the ""Light of the Revolution"", is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
She was originally introduced as the vice president of Baroque Works and the secondary antagonist of the Alabasta Saga, known as Miss All Sunday, before joining the Straw Hats. She is the seventh member of the crew, the sixth to join, and like Nami, is the second to rejoin, doing so near the end of the Enies Lobby Arc. Robin is also the first member to have once been an antagonist. She ate the Hana Hana no Mi. 
 
During the Post-War Arc, she became involved with the Revolutionaries for two years. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history. She currently holds a bounty of Beli130,000,000  
 
""𝐈𝐫𝐨𝐧 𝐌𝐚𝐧""𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐤𝐲 is the shipwright for the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
A cyborg from Water 7, he was originally the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers. He is originally from South Blue, but left 32 years ago as a four-year-old child. He was originally named ""Cutty Flam"" until he threw away his original name for his nickname per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. 
 
Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats until circumstances forced them to become allies. At the request of the Franky Family, Franky decided to join the Straw Hats to fulfill his dream of creating and riding a ship capable of circumnavigating the world, the Thousand Sunny. 
 
He is the eighth member of the Straw Hat crew and the seventh to join Luffy's crew. He currently has a bounty of Beli94,000,000. Previously going by the epithet, ""Cyborg"" Franky, after most likely having his favourite weapon being confused as his main body by the authorities, he has since gained the new nickname, ""Iron Man"". 
 
""𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐥 𝐊𝐢𝐧𝐠"" 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐤 is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
He is a skeleton that the Straw Hats found on board of a ghost ship after drifting into the Florian Triangle.  He is a Devil Fruit user who ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, and is undead, having been brought back into a pseudo-immortal state because of its powers.  
 
He is the ninth member of the Straw Hat crew, and the eighth to join Luffy's crew, as well as being the oldest and the tallest member on board. He is also one of the two swordsmen onboard their current ship, with the other being Roronoa Zoro. He fills the role of the long-awaited musician that Luffy had wanted for his crew ever since his journey began. 
He currently has a bounty of Beli83,000,000.

    One Piece is a masterpiece of storytelling that anyone should watch during his lifetime! So what are the gems that lie beneath this story, in general? (I''ll comment about the anime version at the end of this review) 
 
STORY 10: (personal importance factor [pif] x1.4) 
 
Well, there is a lot that can be told about the story but I'll try to be really laconic. We have a newby young pirate named Luffy setting off on his adventure across the oceans to become the King of Pirates. Yes, it's really commonplace. But what's pulling you in on this grossly big adventure is Luffy getting new nakama and the wonderful experiences they come along with as a big family. My compatriot Cavafy's poem (written more than a century ago) describes Luffy's journey in a beautiful and exact way: 
 
As you set out for Ithaka 
hope your road is a long one, 
full of adventure, full of discovery. 
Laistrygonians, Cyclops, 
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them: 
you’ll never find things like that on your way 
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high, 
as long as a rare excitement 
stirs your spirit and your body. 
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,  
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them 
unless you bring them along inside your soul, 
unless your soul sets them up in front of you. 
 
Hope your road is a long one. 
May there be many summer mornings when, 
with what pleasure, what joy, 
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time: 
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations 
to buy fine things, 
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony, 
sensual perfume of every kind— 
as many sensual perfumes as you can; 
and may you visit many Egyptian cities 
to learn and go on learning from their scholars. 
 
Keep Ithaka always in your mind. 
Arriving there is what you’re destined for. 
But don’t hurry the journey at all. 
Better if it lasts for years, 
so you’re old by the time you reach the island, 
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way, 
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich. 
Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey. 
Without her you wouldn’t have set out. 
She has nothing left to give you now. 
 
And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled 
you. 
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, 
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas 
mean. 
 
WORLD-BUILDING: 10 (pif x1.4) 
 
Luffy and his friends travel a long way through an enormous ocean with a major variety of strange and amazing islands, kingdoms and societies awaiting them. Each unique yet a part of a uniform whole. All these different places and societies broach many real-world issues, such as diversity, racism, political corruption and much more... And they are all tied together in a perfect way! 
 
ART: 10 (pif x1.2) 
 
Well, the art (both in manga and anime) complete the whole with respect to the detailed story, as well as the anime version adds an enjoyable liveliness. 
 
SOUND: 10 (pif x0.5) 
 
Outstanding openings and theme songs (not all of them though) which match the story perfectly. I would enjoy downloading them as phone calls. 
 
CHARACTERS: 10 (pif x0.5) 
 
Luffy and his nakama make such a great company that I wish I could become one of them. Their bonds are strong enough to consider them a family and, in another way, their journey is rather a family adventure. One's dream is everyone's dream! Their nakama lives are more important than theirs! This is One Piece! 
 
AVERAGE: 10 (I want moreeee!) 
 
The ONLY very bad thing about the anime (NOT the manga) is that the story proceeds very very slowly from about the Dressrosa Arc and after (~ ep. 630 up to today). This is the reason I dropped it when the arc met its closure. 
 
In conclusion, I could type in front of my laptop's screen for hours but that would be much of a torture for the readers. If anyone reads this at all. :p :p :p

    The prospect of watching through One Piece at this day and age is daunting, to say the least. Past 800 episodes at the time of writing, joining the One Piece hype train can seem impossible; however, if you even think you might be interested in the show, please pick it up. Allow me to explain why: 
 
The story of One Piece is an exploration of a world which has more layers than I hazard to comprehend. Shows which run even an eighth of the length of One Piece often make the mistake of presenting the world in a way where each new segment feels like it was made up for that arc, with hardly a thought beforehand. One Piece, however, unfolds its story and interlocking parts in ways which feel like a rug rolling out before the viewer. The flow of the story feels natural, and One Piece is notoriously good at playing the long game when it comes to characters, places, or information becoming relevant. It's a masterful exploration of how to build a world and then fill it with a story which adequately satisfies the grandiose and the intimate. (10/10) 
 
The art of One Piece, however, suffers greatly. As a TV anime--a TV anime which has aired practically weekly since 1999--it is subject to having to make do on a lower budget than preferable, leading to a lot of dicey background drawings or long-distance drawings. It has shining moments, but it is largely merely adequate. I can comfortably say that if you want to experience One Piece as a visually impressive art form, you are better off reading the manga, which is a masterclass in how to panel a visual story and, by comparison, puts the anime to shame. (6/10) 
 
I have a very soft spot in my heart for the sonic universe of One Piece. Whether the staff which helped put together the first effects and insert songs for the show knew they would be in this gig for the long hall, I do not know; I do know, however, that they have played the long game just as well as Eiichiro Oda himself. A tracklist for an episode today may have two songs introduced in Romance Dawn, two tracks introduced during a Grand Line arc, and two tracks introduced during a New World arc. With nearly two decades of material to recycle, One Piece could easily make do with what they already have; but Kouhei Tanaka and the sound design team are constantly working to outdo themselves and boost the anime to new heights by means of their labor. In episode 826, for example, an entirely new arrangement of the series' very first opening was brought in for an emotional moment, and it quite actually left me in tears. We may never have a long-running series again in our lifetime that will have the opportunity to use music and sound in the same way that One Piece has. Toei's team has taken an area that many overlook in long-running shows and turned it into an integral part of the world and storytelling of One Piece. (10/10) 
 
The characters of One Piece are without peer. Without exception, we see each and every main character at their best and their worst. It's easy to fall in love with an ensemble when you're with them for over 800 episodes, but the humanity and power behind the interactions of the Strawhat Pirates and the people they come in contact with are to die for. (10/10) 
 
One Piece is a romp which does anything and everything you could want in a show. You will laugh, cry, leap from your seat, and cheer for this series. On more than one occasion, I have gone back to rewatch an old arc once I had caught up to a current arc, and the wealth of callbacks in the show thoroughly rewards viewers who make sure they are up to date. (10/10) 
 
Though its art is lackluster, One Piece is practically the perfect battle shonen. If you like action, adventure, fantasy, or a good drama, One Piece has it all in spades. (9/10)

    Right now, at 2:40 in the morning for me, I have decided to write a review for quite possibly my favorite anime of all time. However, I have decided to write it for people who might be off put by the length of One Piece. One Piece, first and foremost, is an anime/manga that follows the story of 1 of many pirates, Luffy, whose dream is to become the Pirate King. Pretty standard shounen stuff right? At first glance, you might be inclined to just skip past this, not only due to it's length, but to it's seemingly generic plot. Generic Shounen Guy wants something, and he's probably going to get it because he's Generic Shounen Guy. That however, isn't the point behind One Piece at all.This anime/manga mainly details the JOURNEY to becoming the Pirate King. One Piece isn't about Luffy's dream to becoming Pirate King, it is about the journey he takes to get there.  
 
Story:  
One Piece has one of the greatest story's I have personally ever read, and a large part of that has to do with the completely unique story One Piece portrays. Yea, you could say that One Piece has elements from other things, but doesn't everything? The story is just grand (outside fillers, which surprisingly, aren't even that awful. And Skypia. I think I'm the only one that doesn't like skypia though) and when things happen, even to characters that you know won't be around during a majority of the adventure, you tend to feel for them.  
 
Art:  
Unlike most older animes, One Piece's art style has honestly aged well, and only gotten better. Nuff Said. 
 
Sound:  
The OST for One Piece is honestly One of the best Piece's of music I've ever listened too. (get it?) The openings are fantastic, and so are the endings. 
 
Characters: 
The characters in One Piece are extremely unique, and are pretty much all memorable, if not by name, but by what they looked like or what they said. Some characters just had a certain way of speaking, others looked extremely funny, and some were just memorable in general.  
 
Enjoyment:  
Some animes that are much shorter than One Piece have often gone on the backburner when I get in the mood for One Piece, mainly because if I'm in that mood, I can't really scratch my anime itch unless I watch some One Piece.  
 
Overall: 
Definitely the best anime I've ever seen, and I challenge anyone to give me one better.

    Action, adventure, comedy-- If you're looking for the perfect mix of epic action and dramatic, tear-jerking scenes, well my friend, One Piece is for you.  
 
I think in order to watch One Piece, you've gotta throw away any of your first opinions, because the thing that threw me off at first was the art style, as well as the ""overwhelming"" number of episodes. So disregard those right now, or else you'll miss out on something huge. And stay committed! 
 
The overall character development is sure to cause some tears at some point. Watching (or reading) the powerful backstories of the characters, as well as the inspirational effort shown as they overcame them is truly remarkable. Something many anime have, and always will, have a struggle with, and Oda pulled it off for nine characters, all equally amazing. 
 
Along with the development, the emotions triggered while watching this anime are unstoppable. Be prepared for tears at some point-- grab your tissues. The way the story is presented, you're bound to feel a pang in your chest, or tear up.  
 
The message portrayed in this fun, upbeat anime is also something outstanding. In every episode, One Piece never fails to inspire you, as the characters all chase down their dreams.  
""Follow your dreams, and don't let anyone prove you wrong.""  
 
One Piece is my favourite anime, ever. You'll love it, and it isn't anything like what you may have thought!

    Coming into this anime I didn't have a high expectation, I thought it would be a generic shounen that gained popularity by having predictable story and crap characters.But my god was I wrong. 
 
Story-This is where the show is at it's peak, the story told in one piece was done well overall, at the start it was very good but slowly went downhill with slow pacing and overused dialogue. The story worked in arcs each island the straw hat crew visited each new arc would arrive. Each island had it's own story ranging between interesting, well throughout story's and some having slow pacing and overused dialogue. 
 
 Rarely in the story they would switch from the main plot, they usually keep on focus and don't drift from the main objective. Overall each main character has a simple thing they want to achieve but it comes with heaps of obstacles along the way. This story feels like it could go forever with heaps of things to explore and new mystery coming up along the way. Even though this story is quite predictable it has quite unique plot twists and moments no one saw coming. The pacing at the moment is very slow with around 5 minutes at the start of pure looking back at the last episode. 
 
 Filler is not that common in one piece, but when it comes up it is usually quite interesting. The comedy was well done in this story with each crew mate having there own unique personality and having funny and great rivalries. The action in one piece is very intense with moments done so well you will be out of your seat in excitement or in tears from the well wrote out story's with either happy or sad endings. This story does have some rather pointless arcs but that's what makes the good arcs better it always seems to have a satisfying ending. What makes some of these arcs good are the exploration that comes along with it, the parts where they verse the final villain always seems to be the lowest point of an arc but jut watching them walk around and to see how that island works is much more interesting and always finds away to pull you in 9/10. 
 
Art- One piece is known for it's unique art, there are always mixed opinions about it's unique style and it stops some people from watching the show. The old style of one piece went for around 200 episodes and that's when it was at it's best. The style pulled you in and gave you a more creative feel to it. It then became more colorful and it went from a creative feel to a colorful kid show. They overdid the animation with heaps of mistakes and putting no work into it. In the last 100 episodes of one piece they just seemed to of give up on the animation and make it look like a pile of crap. The first art style felt well with one piece but the rest seemed out of place like it was missing some kind of crazy,wacky feel to it. The only time you saw them use CGI animation was in the 6th movie where they did it the whole way through. This felt a bit wrong at first but then it seemed to fit in quite well. The character designs were a bit over the top with some characters looking like they were just there for comedy purposes. One of the greatest things in one piece were that no characters look the same and they all had weird unique appearances. Overall the art started well but then went downhill 5/10. 
 
Sound- The voice actors in one piece are amazing showing heaps of emotion and giving the characters a fell of realism. It felt like most of them fit the role of the characters being the only one who could do them so well. After each 100 episodes you felt the voice actor get better pushing the amount of emotion they could put into each characters voice. The dubbed voices are not to bad, the funimation dub put a lot of effort finding the right people but there still was a lot of room for improvement. The background music was quite good it fitted with the scenes from the anime and it gave you a sense of emotion or excitement at points. Some tracks could make you cry played at the right time and some could take away that level of excitement at points. The OST is not something I would listen to everyday or every week, but maybe now and then I might listen to some of the better tracks in my spare time. The openings were always good especially 1,18,15,17 all get you pumped up and excited for the episode. The first opening we go does get over praised and is overused in the show with around 5 different versions of it. Overall with some notable tracks good voice acting and great openings one piece gets 8/10 in sound. 
 
Character- Most characters gave something away like if they were smart, dumb, very strong or even if they are weak. Every character has a weakness and a strength. Most characters didn't feel like they reacted to situations in a realist way. If someone was dying they wouldn't save them they would kill the enemy who caused the injury. Most reactions were based around revenge leading into some predictable story lines. With so many characters there will always be one you can relate with, making you find that character like another version of yourself. With a series so long and still going the characters grew quite a bit, but they still have a lot more room to grow personality and strength. The characters changed a little but it made such a big difference and they always found different ways to challenge themselves. Most villains seemed to have a strong motive what they would follow. The depth in some of the characters was very shallow with not to much history or much of a back story. The show had a narrator who was boring showing no expression in his voice. This show had so many characters but each one was done so well making it not noticeable how many characters they used. I think that you will remember most of these characters because of there unique personality. Overall each character is done very well and makes the show a lot more interesting. 8/10 
 
Enjoyment- I feel like most people can enjoy this anime a lot, it had great, memorable moments and some amazing scenes. If you can look past the bad animation you will go on a amazing adventure with highs and lows. This show may be childish but has some deep meanings. One piece could be mainstream if people sat down turned on there TV's and gave it a chance. The whole show would not be able to re watch but overall the great moments I would surely sit back and watch. Owning this series would be very difficult and take out a lot of time so I'm sure there a lot of people that would do it but it wouldn't float my boat. This series will always be remembered as the longest and one of the greatest series of all time with 10 years of it still running there is still a lot of time to change some of the issues in this anime like it's animation and unfitting music. The memorable moments will always be in my mind as some of the greatest moments in anime history. 8/10 
 
Overall this is one for the greatest anime of all time. it has memorable characters and great moments. It will always be remembered for all it's pros and if it will fix it's poor animation it will surely get a 10/10. But of course that's wrong so in the end One Piece will get a 8/10

    Ok, my first anime's were naruto, bleach, and d-grayman. I'd always talk to my friends at school about them and debate and discuss plot elements, characters, etc. However, over our senior trip they started talking about an anime they loved very much and praised more than Bleach at times: it was called One Piece. Now, i'm a bleach die-hard fan so when they kept praising this show i kept thinking ""Whats the big deal?"" I'd heard a bit about One Piece but not too much and i thought it was kinda baby compared to bleach or d-grayman. I also heard how long it was which really raised some doubts. I mean c'mon 400+ episodes long!? how can anything even go for a span as long as that?! I thought it was an overestimated, watered down anime, so when i finally began watching it after yu-yu-hakusho mid-summer i had my doubts and didn't expect much. Please permit me to say it now: I AM SO SORRY. I TAKE IT ALL BACK. One Piece is amazing. Period. The characters I found were likable and before you knew it became like a family, true nakama. The humor was greatly done and made me chuckle all the way through. Now the plot did take a bit to pick up with the actual story, but it didnt matter! The individual adventures were enjoyable and did well with pacing themselves out, even if alabastar and skypiea were a bit long. While the animation was kinda rugged in the biggining (which isnt bad at all considering it was 1999) it picked up nicely after skypiea and looked great. Now it wasnt perfect, it was a bit hard to develope a epic atmosphere at times during some of the arcs due to the more humor bases of the anime (ex. zoros fight with the giraffe was mainly goofing off and the big bad guy for chopper was kinda dumb) but it definatley has its epic moments, even more so than other anime. I sitll go back and watch Luffy kick the crap out of Crocodile and be amazing in his fight against Lucci (he will not fall, so epic!) Oh and while we're on Luffy can i say how much of a man he is! i mean when he climbed that huge mountain to save his nakama or the many other amazing things he did, aw man! And the rest of the crew too! ( if i went into it this would go on forever...oh wait too late, sorry) However one of the greatest things this anime has displays is the true meaning of nakama. The scene were nami is stabbing herself and throwing sand at luffy telling him to go way, and then cries and asks for his help. Aw man the hat symbolism, ""You are my nakama i will protect you"" i still go back and watch that. Each adventure showed more an more of the One Piece universe and made me fall in love with the crew more and more. Oh and the length, *ahem* Naruto, Bleach, you two have no right to complain anymore!!!!!! I dont want to hear it about the ""We need more fillers to let the manga get farther"" crap. I thoughtr fillers were there to serve that purpose, until i watched One Piece. 478 episodes and only 40 filler! (AT the most!) And its til way behind the manga from wat ive heard! I dont want to hear it anymore Bleach. (already gave up on naruto anime, read manga) Another great thing about One Piece is that it is very ingenuative. In the early episodes of say, Bleach, the characters had special powers and used them to cunningly beat their enemies, like ishida and Rengi's team up against the number 8 espada. But then it turned int okinda just a bunch of ""power battles"" like DBZ where whoever is strongest wins. (btw Bleach is my fav anime so dont think i hate it its just its kinda grating where it is) One Piece, however, has ingenuity all the way through and doesnt rely on just power battles. When Luffy's enemy can read his mind and predict his movements he decides to punch the wall behind him and let his attacks ricochet all over so the enemy cant read it, or Ussop tricking his enemy into unconsciousness when she coudve overpowered him easy. But dont think its just a bunch of weaklings who hav to outsmart everyone, they are strong too! Like the Groggy Ball where sanji and Zoro team up to totally overpower the competition or Luffy's first use of Gear Second. (Still love that) Oh and about that in particular, it doesnt get waterted down the moe he used it. Like in Bleach, Bankai is just another power everyone has and has kinda got watered down, but when Luffy initiated Gear Second you just know its gonna be epic and powerful. The humor was also very welcomed as it seemed to help move the plot along since it was so long. Overall I was very impressed with the series as a whole and cant wait for the new episodes every week. One Piece was the most pleasant surprise thats ever happened to me. Great characters, solid story, uplifting overall atmosphere, epic battles, good humor, it has it all! Im very, very sad that i hav caught up and will now hav to wait every week but i can truely say it has been a fantastic adventure that i will never forget. Arigato, One Piece!

    Where do I begin…? XD I put off this anime for a LONG time, but I seriously regret that now, partially because I now have to catch up -.- but also because… well…I can’t really fault this series at all! XD 
This is my first review so I’ll try cover everything I can think of! And this review will be 100% spoiler free (I’m prone to spoilers myself…) 
NOTE: I watch the FUNimation dub. 
 
Story: If your looking for an anime with a solid plotline your watching the wrong anime. The main point of the series is finding the treasure left by the infamous pirate Gol D. Rogers, the One Piece. However where I am at the moment this has been interrupted by a side mission to help someone, and I’m guessing this is how the story will continue. (Note: I know NONE of the story past where I am now, I don’t read the manga or watch the sub) Despite the randomness of story it’s still brilliant and extremely entertaining, which, let’s face it, is the main point of a story. As for the pirate aspect of the story…I have no interest in pirates (another reason why I put it off), but to be honest Luffy’s crew is not your average pirate crew…to say the least XD 
 
Art: Okay, so THIS is what put me off the series for so long, and looking back at that now I feel slightly embarrassed…I really love the art now! It’s different, unique I guess you might say, which is exactly why I liked anime such as Soul Eater. When I was deciding on whether to watch One Piece or not, I kept coming across forums and people saying “Don’t worry the art improves after a while.” I’ve seen a bit of the “improved” art and to be honest I think I prefer the old one, but that’s just a personal preference I guess. Anyway, anyone reading this DO NOT do what I did and not watch the series because of the art, because you will regret it! XD 
 
Characters: What can I say? Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of this show is the characters. Where I am in the series, there are 6 members in the crew, each one as different as the next. This variety of characters is one of the strongest points of the series. There is BOUND to be someone in the crew that you will love. As for the main protagonist, he’s just as idiotic and loveable as so many other main shounen characters. In fact, he’s probably more idiotic and loveable than all of them combined! You only have to say the name Monkey D. Luffy and I’ll start laughing! To be honest, this show is worth watching just for Luffy…well, him and Zoro maybe ^^” 
 
Sound: I’ve loved all the opening and ending songs so far, and I particularly love how FUNimation dubs them using voice actors (Vic Mignogna singing the first opening definitely helped me to keep watching, not that I really needed any help…) As for the music in the show, I don’t notice it that often, but when I do, it’s very fitting and works well with whatever is happening at the time. Off the top of my head I can think of one example of a song that plays at sad moments and really helps set the mood, it’s a beautiful piece of music. 
 
Enjoyment: This anime is perhaps one of THE best anime in relation to enjoyment. I haven’t found myself being bored once. The other day I found myself watching an episode and when I was finished I realised nothing had happened in it…and I was still so entertained by it! It didn’t fail at one moment to keep my attention. The fights are also brilliant and don’t tend to drag too much (in fact they may be a little short XD) To be honest, there are few other shows that have made me laugh as much as One Piece. 
 
Overall, this anime is a MUST SEE! And what’s brilliant about it is despite it being a mainstream, long running shounen, it has practically no fillers! (And even when it does I find it really hard to differentiate between them and the canon story) Sure, the story drags at points but that’s to be expected from an anime like this, and unlike other series, I don’t notice the drag as much. It’s just too entertaining for that! XD  
 
I would give this series a 9 but looking over my review the only flaw I can find is it drags a little…however I’m not sure about giving it a 10 because of this…so I guess I’ll have to give it a score of 9.5!

    I'm fairly new to One Piece; can't say I carry over that nostalgic feel, but that doesn't mean I don't love it.  
One piece's story is wonderful. It's such a broad idea and can always stay on the main story. There is rarely ever any fillers which is great. 
The fight scenes are awesome too. There's always tension in them, leaving you at the edge of your seat.  
So far (as of episode 351) I hate how no one will die. Everyone seems to live by some wonder or just lives in general despite being hit by something like a bomb millions of times. It's nothing I can't deal with of course, and I've heard it changes later on so I'm anticipating it. 
Personally One Piece is one of my favorites too. I highly recommend this. Even though its 700+ episodes and still going, it's incredibly worth it.

             I love One Piece. Let me start by summarizing the show for the 8 of you on the internet who has no idea what I'm talking about. One Piece is set in a Constructed World (A setting with no connection of any kind to ours in geography or history), where the world is one giant ocean, with some barriers separating it into four seas. It is the Age of Pirates, set off by the death of Gold Roger, and Monkey D. Luffy wants to find the legendary treasure One Piece, therefore becoming the next King of the Pirates. Because he ate one of the Devil Fruits, cursed produce that grant mystical powers to those who consume them, he is made of rubber. He gathers a crew, gets a ship, and fights other pirates. 
 
       Let me start with what is bad, the reason many do not like the show. The animation ranges, but it starts off on the closer end of bad. The dialogue is often cheesy and over the top. The characters, at first glance, are very 2-dimensional and annoying. It constantly breaks science and reason in every way you can possibly imagine. There are several filler arcs, many of which are bad. The original dub by 4kids Entertainment is probably the worst dub of all time, with a lot of unnecessary censorship and terrible casting and writing. It is, I think, the biggest reason for those who do not like it. 
 
      Now for me to gush about what I love. The action is amazing, honestly my favorite from any anime I've seen. The dialogue is over the top, but that's the point. Everything in this show is over-the-top, because that's how it is. The drama, sadness, awesomeness, comedy, and heartwarmingness are all purposely turned up to eleven. That's part of the point. The music, both in show and the openings, are fantastic. And my favorite part is the characters. I said earlier that they can appear 2-dimensional and that's true, from a certain point of view. But once you start paying more attention, the characters have far more depth than you would have though from the silly shonen anime you heard about. Luffy is that ""I'm gonna follow my dreams, eat a lot of food, and get stronger"" kind of protagonist, but then he says stuff that is kinda amazing. ""If I die while trying to reach my dream, then I die."" And he's not blowing smoke out his ass either, at one point when he thinks he will die, he accepts it with a huge grin on his face. The whole cast is like this, and several backstories will make you cry. 
 
     One Piece feels like it was made with a passion, and a message I agree with to a T. It is my shonen anime, and one I shall defend to the grave. Now if only Funimation would catch up on the collections and get back to dubbing the damn thing already!

    One Piece is an excellent show. It's exceedingly funny and I guarantee that you will laugh. The main characters are so weird and insane that you immediately love them.  
 
First there's Monkey D. Luffy, who is this optimistic boy that can stretch his body thanks to a Gum-Gum fruit he ate as a child. He's the captain.  
 
Then there's the sarcastic sword master, Roronoa Zolo, who practices santoryu, which means he uses three swords at once. He is the first mate.  
 
Nami is the third member to join the crew. She's a thief who hates almost all pirates with a passion, but adores money. She's the navigator.  
 
Usopp is the fourth crew member. He's a total scaredy-cat and always tells lies. He's the crew's sharpshooter.  
 
The fifth crewman is Sanji, who's a serious ladies' man. He is the cook.  
 
And then there's Tony Tony Chopper, who is...a reindeer. He's just a tad shy. He's the crew's doctor.  
 
There might be more crew members, but I don't know of any others. They're all really interesting, but the enemies are just absurd. Every time you see a new one you have to stare at it for a minute or so just to figure out whether he's wearing a wig, or if that's REALLY his outfit. The storyline is great and the music makes me smile. Even if you don't obsess over pirates like I do, you will love this show. Sorry there might be some mistake's because, it took a long time to do it and bare my English.

    One Piece, without a doubt is the best anime I have ever watched. You may not have liked the art in the beginning but guys.... it was in 1998. The art develops as the story continues. One Piece is about Monkey D. Luffy, our protagonist who sets out on a adventure to become the Pirate King. One Piece has probably the best story line in the history of anime. Each islands Luffy and his crew visits are filled with amazing detail and creativity. One Piece truly is the best anime/manga i have ever watched/read.

    Now this anime now this anime, I was very hesitant about first cos I am a bleach maniac and love naruto loads, so I was like I wont like this. Now how wrong was I , well I started watching it ye its really slow at the start, very very slow. But later on it gets amazing. The characters in One Piece are top class, they just are so well developed with such good back stories. On to the actual story its really good well made well plotted, ok there are fillers loads of them but hey these fillers are pretty good. Characters like Smoker Zorro Robbin are all characters who develop excellently through the anime. Art I did not like much at the start, but later on it gets better. Sound is awesome music is awesome some very very tense moments. Enjoyment a full 10 because its so good. Overall I'd give it a 9 Im still watching it at the moment at episode 430 its so good do not miss it, Bleach number 1 one piece number 2 and gintama 3 and naruto 4 for me lol.

    Though some may be drawn away by the length of One Piece or the fan base, I decided to give it a try. Having liked the episodes shown on Cartoon Network as a kid, One Piece was always a name familiar to me. This series is outstanding. It is a bit slow moving at first, but it picks up tremendously. The character development is outstanding, and you really feel like you are right there with the characters. Through times of happiness and sorrow, you are moved by the characters and grow near personal bonds with them. The story grabs you in and it feels like you are in a completely different world while you are watching. This is a must see for any anime fan.

                                  One Piece. The Treasure Of Shounen Anime? 
One Piece is a PG 13 tale of adventure and comedy. It has been around since 1999 and the author said it is only half way done. It's no surprise this anime is in the top big 3! 
 
The One Piece story is a simple story about a kid named  Monkey D Luffy with a dream to become the Pirate King and to obtain the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. The first couple of arcs is basically getting his powerful, witty crew together. Usually when an anime is introducing main characters there is little action, but not in the case of this one. Whether he had one partner or five The Straw Hat Crew (Luffy's Crew) always managed to stay in trouble. This anime is not just about it's action or wise crack moments, but it also get intense and will have you in tears (personal experience) as more of the story and mystery unravels. 
 
The art of this show throws some people off because it is not like the usually anime style, but looks cartoonish. I love the art and actually a lot of shows before the 2000's especially in the 70's and 80's looked like One Piece. I think it's art gives it unique style an easily distinguished it from the rest. 
 
The sound is where I have mixed views. If you watched this is dub I am so sorry and I know how you are skeptical of watching this show, but that was 4Kids dub. They chopped up the anime and made the voices younger like so it would appeal to kids. That is why I recommend skipping dub all together in this anime. Even the FUNimation dubbed is not finished and not worth watching. Please watch this anime in sub to get a taste of what the anime is really supposed to be like. Besides the Voice Actors do a splendid job. As for theme music I missed the first opening. I felt it went really well with the pirate them. I like the other openings as songs, but it really doesn't fit the adventure mood. 
 
The characters are something else. They are cliched yet not cliche and it's really hard to explain. I do not want to spoil it so I will only tell you that the characters each have their own special personality and this show works a great deal of showing their backgrounds. Even minor characters are not neglected in the show and you grow to love them like you grow to love the main characters. 
 
Overall I loved this anime and I recommend it to a person who loves to laugh, cry, and be overwhelmed with other emotions through the long ride.

    Let’s talk about One Piece. 
 
Now, why would anyone in their right mind watch, as of this review, 588 episodes -- 8 days of their life (if you watch 24 hours a day) -- on one anime which shows no signs of ending anytime in the next 10 years? In my humble opinion: because One Piece is the paramount serial anime series on the planet. I cannot imagine any other series captivating my attention from the first episode and holding it for so long. There are always new and exciting things to discover, and the stories of each crew member will make you love them for all eternity. Other crew members aside, Luffy is the reason this show is so amazing; he is the greatest main character in any series. His funny and light attitude makes the show enormously entertaining, and it contrasts and intensifies his strong emotions when he truly gets serious. Of course, the fight scenes are amazing and seeing new devil’s fruits or new techniques (especially some around the halfway mark :D ), will make your heart soar with excitement. The way that Oda (writer of the original manga) has created a world where the crew can go into any environment and find any enemy with any power, while still progressing the story, is complete genius. I have laughed, cried and jumped for joy while watching this show and I won’t be stopping anytime soon.  
 
But beware; once you start you won’t be able to stop. Plan accordingly. 10/10

    My favorite anime, one I cherish more than any other, one helped me tot realize my one and only wish. Being real good people, being with real good people, treasuring them and having a beautiful friendship is what I have always dreamed of, in other words. Each character, each episode is my treasure. As I am watching them, I find happiness. When they are happy I become happy, to see them being happy. And I feel sorry when they feel so.  
This is why I One Piece this much. 
Respecting anyone's own taste and liking I don't have a right to criticize anybody as well. I am fully aware of for anybody's taste and liking this anime might be cheesy, never-ending and exaggerated.

    I'd like to start by saying that I don't have many gripes with One Piece's story. The rating that I have given it is not a reflection of any flaws with the story, but instead a product of several other factors. 
 
I might also add that I do read the manga, which doesn't suffer from the same problems as the anime. I rather enjoy it, and I do recommend it. 
 
The anime, though, is a different story altogether. 
 
Since we've already established that I like the story, we'll start with the quality of the art. 
 
When I first began watching One Piece, I quickly fell in love with the art. Some people detested it, but it was a bit of a hook for me. 
 
Then, suddenly, after years of tuning in, I began to notice that the animation was a far cry from what it was when I was new to the world of One Piece. 
 
While artistic changes aren't necessarily bad, the types of changes that I noticed certainly were: less detail, more generic designs for some characters, terribly animated scenes. 
 
Admittedly, if the art was the only problem, the show would be at least bearable. Unfortunately, however, that is not the case; the pacing is even more horrendous than the animation, though it wasn't always so. 
 
As a matter of fact, the show's pacing was the nail in the coffin for me; it makes me (and many other viewers) wish that the studio would just throw in some fillers just to put some distance between the manga and the anime. 
 
To be blunt, so little happens in each episode that I sometimes wonder why the episodes are 23 to 24 minutes in length.  
 
The typical structure of an episode is as follows: 3.5 minute opening, 3 minute recap of the last episode, 7 minutes of "" new content"" (which consists of maybe 4 minutes of actual new content and 3 minutes of pointless reaction shots and overused flashbacks, and I'm being generous here), a 30 second mid-episode break, 8 minutes of some more content which follows nearly the same pattern as the pre-break material, and a 30 second preview of the next episode. 
 
I hope that all adds up to 23 or 24 minutes. 
 
Not like it matters. 
 
The studio clearly doesn't care about producing decent content, so why should I care about carefully estimating the amount of new material that is introduced per episode? 
 
Regardless of what I've written here, I must admit that I will not stop watching One Piece. True, I occasionally fall behind on the anime (as I have now), but I've been watching it for too many years to just give up on it now. 
 
I don't put this kind of time in so that I can quit halfway through. 
 
I'm pretty sure that very few people do, which is probably why this anime still has any viewers at all.

    A great anime that you have to see! When it comes to long-term anime is a piece for me by far at the top. That Oda has created this is simply the madness. Although it is the shortest in comparison to many short anime series, it has an incredible value for the enormous size.. 
Countless characters with intense backgrounds. Over the years, a gigantic universe has built up. In doing so, everything is handmade, and only the coherent and self-sufficient picture. Only the Filler sequences are also exaggerated. The same gilded for the often senseless stretching of the anime. But these are almost the only criticisms I have here.

One Piece is one of the biggest anime and manga out there, not just in length, but also in popularity, now popularity is not a good way to proof quality, but when the source manga is not only THE most sold manga in the world with over 100mil more sales than the number 2 most sold manga but its also THE most sold COMIC in the world by a single author and it got a record in the Guinness book, beside manga sales its also one of the most popular anime even here on mal at number 32 and 4 in most favourites, its also one of the most talked about show in youtube, with many big anime youtubers being fans of it, like Gigguk, chibi and even someone who is more critical like thatanimesnob said it was actually pretty good at some point, and again I know that popularity doesn't equal quality, but when a show is THIS popular, you can at least fairly say its does somethings good.  
 
over the years the show's quality has changed a lot, and not in a linear fashion where it kept getting better or kept getting worse, it just went up and down in quality a lot, to the point that if I had to rate each arc differently some would get as high as a 10 and some would get as low as a 5. 
The Good : 
 
1- If you look at the genres for One Piece in MAL you'll see :  Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Shounen, Super Power 
 
and I have to say one piece does all of these genres very very well. 
 
Action : the fights in one piece aren't that frequent with the story more focused around other things, but when they do happen they are very well done and there many different types of fights, you have some fights that are centred around raw power or some that use tactics and brains, and every fight has a lot of meaning behind it, in a sense that the stakes are high and what the characters had to do to reach that fight was a lot, basically the author really knows how to hype up fights before they happen.  
 
Adventure/Fantasy : the is probably one of the best thing about one piece, I've met many different kinds of people who've watched the show and one thing they always praise -even if they hated most other things- is the world building and the adventure in it, the world in one piece is HUGE with many island that each have their own kind of twist, a lot of different factions from pirates to world government to underworld workers to kings and leaders of the islands, almost every type of mythical creature there is, from mermaids, fishmen and dwarfs to giants, dragons, undead and talking animal people ( and much more ), and experiencing all of these islands gives a really nice sense of adventure, and the world is also very well connected, for example one character from the early episodes ends up being in an important character in an arc 500 episodes later.  
 
Comedy : this one is different to each person but I found the comedy in one piece hilarious and has really good delivery and timing, I'd link you some funny moments but its hard to understand it in its own without having an idea about the characters.  
 
Drama : its hard to go into this one without too much spoilers but I can say that one piece has affected me emotionally with its many tearjerking moments, even ones that you'd never expect.  
 
Superpowers : Superpowers in one piece can be very simple or very creative and interesting, but even the simple ones can be made creative with how the characters use them.  
 
Now MAL doesn't say One Piece has Mystery, but I'd say it does, Oda (the aurhtor) also leaves a lot of hints and forshadowing in many parts of the story and its why there are a bunch of one piece theories out there, I mean just search "" one piece theory"" on youtube and see how many results you get. 
and the ways these mysteries are revealed are also pretty good, not in an asspull kind of way but in way that will make you go "" whhaaat! so thats what happened!"" 
 
2- One Piece has some of my favourites Soundtracks that are really effective in doing what they are trying to do, whether its for building hype or making the viewer emotional. 
 
3- The characters are also a great part of one piece, with many of them having really awesome designs, interesting/emotional backstory, and each have their own goals and ideologies. 
 
Our main crew in particular is really great, seeing their interactions with each other is surprisingly one of my favourite things about the show, they are all interesting in their own ways. 
 
The Bad :  
 
Just like my ratings indicates, One Piece has a lot of problems and even someone who loves one piece like me can see them. 
 
1- For starters the animation is pretty bad overall, it changes over the course of the show, some parts its Sakuga level but most of the time its pretty bad, especially compared to today's standards.  
  
2- while I did say the soundtracks are usually great, the recent episodes haven't really been using great soundtracks, sometimes the SFXs are all over the place, The voice acting for the most part is pretty good and I have no problem with it, but its nothing mindblowing. 
 
3- the pacing of the anime is very very slow, the manga has 870 chapters ( as of right now ) and the anime has 798 episodes, just by looking at those numbers alone you can tell just how slow it is, with the recent 200 something episodes only adapting one chapter OR LESS per episode which is just crazy slow, one piece the manga is already slow enough at some parts but the anime just made it really terrible, there are also always about 5 minutes spent on recaps+opening. however that is not always the case, while the early episodes also had slow pace, its wasn't nearly as bad as now, and it was a very minor problem, which is why I kept watching the show and didnt drop it. 
 
4- Being repetitive is another one of One Piece's problems, however this one is minor, because while every arc has core elements that happen in ever other arc, for the most part its still a fresh new arc and these core elements are done in a slightly different way.  
 
5- Asspulls, One Piece doesn't have many of those but it still does have them and its a problem, fortunately though, when it does happen its in the arcs that are considered one of the better arcs ( because of other things of course ) and so this problem is overshadowed. 
 
6- some parts are pretty much useless and the show would be a lot better without them.  
 
Overall I'd say for sure give One Piece a chance, and keep going until you just cant watch it anymore, if you reach that point before episode 500 then well I guess its not for you, if you reach it after, then I'd say move over to the manga and give it a try, its worth it.  
 
 
 
And thats about it, I hope you found my review helpful, I apologise for any English mistakes I had (English is not my first language) 
 
I wasn't going to write a review but I noticed the reviews for one piece are either all 10s or all 5 or below, and I found both to be ridiculous, so I decided to write my own review.

    I once Loved One Piece, It used to be great... YEARS ago and I'll play Morpheus here before I start the review. 
 
If you want to stay in the illusion that One Piece is the best of greatest animes of all times, let it go, dont read my review. 
If you wanna know why the series is saturated already, keep reading at your own risk, you have been warned: 
 
1- No ONE. EVER. DIES. - It doesn't matter what is happening, if it is a bullet, cannon ball, knife, sword, atomic bomb, war, no one in the series ever dies, Oda only gives you the illusion that the character died to show moments later that everyone is ok. 
 
2- Flashback Kills - This one is contraditory to my first argument, but to dont say that oda never kills, he'll enjoy doing that in flashbacks, in the actual arc be relaxed, no one will die, but in flashbacks? be sure that someone will die. 
 
3- ""Hey, Ace and White Beard Died"" - Yes my Friend, and he made an entire arc for that to happen and who else died without being in a flashback, entire wars and civil wars happened, where EVERYONE got just bruises and scars... 
 
4- Civil Wars : EVERY ISLAND, EVERY SINGLE INSLAND, they face a civil war, one way or another, the population of the island fight, it doesnt matter the reason, they'll just fight. 
 
5- Random Mystery to be solved: Oda tends to throw mysteries around the series, just to solve them 100 chapters later, but it is not like lost, he doesnt give you hints about it, he just throw the mystery, and throw what it means, simple as that, but if you wanna know, keep watching for the next 2 years. 
 
6- Moar Boobs: By the past years, the female boobs is just increasing, while his creativity is diminishing. He is basically throwing random fan-service to keep audience. 
 
7- Hidden Royal Familly Seeking Something: Somehow the Crew will reach an island, and if that island have a monarchy, be sure that the king is overthrown and they will meet the princess and the king in coincidencial circunstances. 
 
8- Secret Organizations: I lost the count how many shady characters and secret organizations appeared, they are always the all powerfull, just to appear another one more all powerfull than before. 
 
9- Epic Moments: At the end of each arc, Oda tends to do something unexpected, and THAT where is his MASTER TRAP is, every arc, usually ends with luffy or someone from the crew doing something amazing or really unexpected, remember when I said about Ace and White Beard Death? That is Shocking, happened at the end of the arc, Goind Merry Being Burned? End of The Arc, Luffy Burning the Marine Flag? hum... And now that the trap is laid, the audience wants to see more, so he dont need to be deep, so shallow plots and characters are just enough, as long as he can keep giving them what they want. 
 
And that's basically his formulae, and it works pretty well, he doesn't change it, people like repetition, Fairy Tail is also a ""success"" so... if you give people simple fights with Power Ups never seen before, boobs floating, Epic Moments at the end, Rinse and repeat, success, One piece is doing that with maestry in his last years, Fairy Tail do that since the beggining, and Naruto do that Since the end of the Genin Tournament. This is Basically the Formuale of all those non ending series.

    Ok. This one is going to be a tough cookie. :| 
 
I will get this out of the way first. I may be slightly biased to One Piece but I have seen at least 70-100 episodes of other long series, Naruto and Bleach being 2 of them, I watched these 3 simultaneously, bad idea I know, but I was recommended Naruto and Bleach from a friend. So why did I watch One Piece you ask? Because no one else had is not the correct answer but pretty close. I wanted something for myself. A series I could devote my time to which I would enjoy. So a year or more ago I started the long grind and as I write this review I am at episode 717 and have seen a lot of the movies, at least 6-7 of them. 
 
This gets me onto my main point. I did say I watched all 3 simultaneously but that is kind of a lie. I watched Naruto and Bleach BEFORE I watched One Piece but dropped them for various reasons, Naruto got boring for me after 70 episodes (I know the second half is better and I will get around to it but smh) and Bleach was pretty good but I just couldn't get into it, I would get bored and stop then rewatch etc. (Like what happened with Fairy Tail). 
 
This now brings me to One Piece. This is the only long show, or any show in general, that I have never gotten bored of. A whole year I have been addicted to it when most other shows I watch for a week, or possibly only a few days, and then drop. The beginning is good, not amazing, but good enough to get you into it but once you get past the beginning few episodes. DAMN. This shit gud. 
 
Now I will get onto some stuff about the actual show. 
 
Art- 7/10 
It's Toei they can't draw for shit and this is the biggest, possibly only (for me), flaw in the show. Some episodes look really good and then some *cough*THEENTIREDRESSROSAARC*cough* don't look very go...od... 
Moving on... 
 
Story 8/10 
Simple. It's so simple that you get used to it then BAM. Something happens that makes you cry into your pillow, which no other long show has done for me. Stuff that you thought was irrelevant makes you cry. 
Simple, good, can't get confused *COUGH* but a little repetitive if you are into your story stuff. IF yuo are watching for entertainment you won't care. I mean look at Gintama it has one of the highest ratings ever but doesn't really have a story. 
My fav arcs are... 
 
1. Enies Lobby/Marineford 
2. Punk Hazard 
3. Fishman Island/Return To Sabaody Archipelago 
 
My fav film is Strong World 
 
Sound 10/10 
Hmmm... Some will DEFINITELY disagree but One Piece openings, endings (The few we had) and background music all fits perfectly in there respected place. 'We Go' after the timeskip was a really nice one since they had been waiting 2 years to adventure and then a really loud and upbeat song came on to show that. 
From the background music, which doesn't change much, to the openings they are all really good. 
My favs are... 
 
OP- 14/11 
ED- 11/15 
 
Characters 10/10 
This is the backbones of the series. So many characters that I want to learn about. Backstory on pretty much anyone gives you an opportunity to award empathy to a villain whereas most series just tell you that this guy is bad and not to like them. One Piece let's you choose if they are right or wrong. All of the crew members are good. None are annoying and I love all of them. I don't want to say anymore just know that all of the characters are really good, apart from Buffalo FFFFFF, so yeah please take a look. 
My favs are... 
 
Luffy, Jinbe, Zoro and a lot of other people but this list would go on forever :( 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
From the emotions to the comedy to the story to the character development to ASL :'(. I love it all. One Piece is the only series, for me, that can make me laugh, cry and want to know what happens next episode so bad I can't wait. Nothing else does this for me and that is why I am going to give One Piece a... (insert drum role)

    Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, a twelve year old girl (me) was new to Anime, and wanted to get into it. She stumbled across One Piece, and since she had nothing better to do, she binged watched it and absolutely adored it. 
 
But, then the fanbase started to get pretty violent, and the episodes airing at the time were dragging out a bit too long, so she decided to drop it for a while.  
 
During the year while she was gone, she discovered different Anime. Shows she actually enjoyed more than One Piece. And thus, returning to One Piece after the fandom had calmed down, after watching new shows that were mature and moving, she realized something she never knew. 
 
This show sucks. It sucks really bad. 
 
Story: 
Every cliche shounen show you can name. No really, just think about any shounen anime, and the first things that come into your mind are there. We've got the childish idiotic protagonists, we've got the overly eccentric girl who hits said protagonists because he's stupid, we've got the dark broody badass with a heart of gold, you can pretty much name everything that's going to happen before it happens. 
 
Art/Animation: 
The animation for the first 100 episodes was fine, for the most part. But in the newer episodes, it just looks so glossy and lazy. It actually hurts my eyes. 
 
Sound: 
The music is fantastic. Really, just get the soundtrack for this thing, it's the only thing that's worth it. 
 
Character: 
Very, very poor. Everyone's just your stereotypical Dragon Ball rip-off. Luffy = Goku, Nami = Bulma, Zoro = Piccolo, Sanji = Vegeta, Usopp = Krillin, Chopper = Chiaotzu, Robin = #18, ect.  
 
Enjoyment: 
None. It was enjoyable up to the Arlong Park arc. After that, it just got boring. Each episode is 20 minutes, and they waste most of that time with themesongs and recapping of the show's plot, and the previous episode. And the time that they do spend is wasted on filler, and the characters just standing around and talking. WHY THE FUCK DID I EVER LIKE THIS SHIT!!?????? 
 
Overall: 
Why am I giving this a 5 when I just tore it apart? Well, I do kind of still have a soft spot for it, as it used to be my favorite show, and it was what introduced me to Anime. And I used to like it because I was, like, 12, and I hadn't seen too many Anime at the time. So, if you have a 12 year old kid with you, show it to them if they wanna see something, it's harmless. Or, if you're new to Anime and you wanna see a shounen show, then go ahead and check it out if you want. It's harmless enough. 
 
But really, the only reason this show is so popular is because its fanbase is just a bunch of twelve year olds who like cliche shounen stuff, and 21-year-olds who're just as immature as the kids. Believe me, I've been in this fanbase. So, just get up to the Arlong Park arc, and just stop. Trust me, it's not worth it. 
 
If you want something original that's mature and relatable, instead of childish and tossing in backstories that's just a bunch of people dying, then I'd suggest giving it a skip.

    I enjoyed early One Piece, the story had me hooked and I would binge as many episodes as I could in a day. That said recently One Piece has begun to really slow down in their stories. Each episode from the Fishman Arc onwards only really has about 10 minutes of new content and a lot of that is looping animations to pad run time. Once it got to the Big Mom Arc I started to notice the extreme drop in animation quality as well. Because of this slow pacing and excessive drop in quality it is hard for me to even watch a single episode now.  
 
Early One Piece for me was a joy, but the post-Fishman Arcs are just so slow and poorly animated it becomes hard to watch after a while.

    One piece review! (as of episode 710) =SPOILERS CONTAINED= 
 
- Synopsis - 
 
      To this day Luffy, A little boy who ate the Gum-Gum fruit is on an adventure to find the one piece! A show centered around its amazing characters, and amazing world building, I feel it deserves my time for a review! This show, on where I am currently standing is at 710 of 851 episodes. My name is Seigyoku, and this is my thoughts on one piece! 
 
-plot/story- 
8/10 
 
The story is about a boy, named Luffy who had grown up with his brothers Ace and Sabo with a bandit mountain gang. Sometime after Luffy has decided to start his journey as a pirate! He has met many friends along the way.  
     
     The story is undoubtedly fantastic, the show gives me a sense of adventure and I feel like I'm with Luffy all the way on this journey. An example of this is when Luffy comes to the arlong park arc. When I first started this arc, it didn't impact me at first, but later in the story during the Fishman Island arc, it amazed me on how far ahead the story could be planned. it takes skill to be able to organize a chronological story while managing it on a weekly manga basis. 
 
as for the backstory arcs, they are worthwhile, rich with a story it leaves you satisfied on knowing the events of what happened. I'd say an amazing backstory example is Law's backstory. It showed how much it can change a person, it felt like I was suffering with Law during the whole thing. On the back of Law's coat that he wears, it says the person name who saved him, which is amazing. it leaves me speechless to know everything has a meaning in this show, and the plot is just about perfect. 
 
- characters - 
9/10 
 
This anime does characters in a unique way, that makes it stand out from other shows. This being a long-running shounen series, It gives the opportunity to build characters up, and make you really attached to them. A good example would be Usopp on the arc of Water 7 Island. The arc was mainly focused around Robin, but even other characters were brimming with rich interaction with the story. Usopp loved the ship of the straw hat pirates it was from his hometown built by one of his most loved. I could feel the pain from Usopp when he reacted to the news of the ship being unsalvagable. He had pride with the ship, and when he heard Luffy's decision his pride and love for the ship made the two have a serious clash which was the highlight of the water 7 arc in my opinion. 
 
Usopp is my favorite character because he used to be such a self-doubting person, and that's why he lied most of the time, to cover that up. In the show, he learns to overcome that self-doubt during that arc. He thinks back on the mistakes he has made and wants to fix them, and it shows that he has matured a lot, he still is cowardly, yes that's just his nature. 
 
-Art/Animation- 
6/10 
 
 
Now, this is probably my most liked part of the entire show, I apologize to the hardcore fans. This show was demanded on a weekly basis, so I can see why it was struggling with consistency on the animation subject. It just felt like I was looking at a painting sometimes if you want an analogy. Which somewhat threw off the immersive feeling of the show.  
 
Not all apples are rotten, there were some amazing scenes, such as mihawk slicing a massive ship clean in half it had so much detail in the scene I couldn't keep my eyes still, but for the majority of the show, it was lacking in some aspects.  
 
Now as for the art, it was unique in some arcs, I really liked the look of marineford, it had this feeling that it had the embodiment of the safety of the world and it had such an interesting design. The fact that there were so many characters it was amazing on how consistent the art stayed natural, even less significant characters looked good. 
 
-music- 
7/10 
 
The music was pretty darn good. The walk to Franky house and hearing that song of the straw hat pirates literally doubled the adrenaline and excitement I was feeling, and some of the soundtracks that really gave it that vibe of it being a monumental event. The death of whitebeard gives me chills when they were naming the casualties and the music that was playing helped with that a lot. So yeah the music was a good impact on the immersive feeling of the show. 
 
-final thoughts- 
overall score: 8/10 
 
I do not regret watching this show, it was worth the time, and thank you Toei animation for orchestrating such a masterpiece, the world loves you for all the joy you have brought to the anime community, this is seigyoku, and this has been my review on one piece, Sayanora!

    I give this anime a 3. I tried watching and watching this show but no, it doesn't work. Find it way to childish. I believe people can find it enjoying to watch when they just want to disconnect sometimes but there is nothing in this show which makes it deserve a 8.3 in rating.  
 
I can explain 1 of many scenes why i find this too silly and the fights boring. There is one fight in the early episodes when they fight a clown pirate ""Buggy"". A cannon gets loaded, Zoro flips it so it is pointed towards the pirates (they are like 2 meter away). For 5 seconds they just stand there like in old cartoons, not moving and then gets shot. There is maaany more silly fights which aren't even fun to watch. 
 
If you are looking for a Adventure anime aimed for more grown up people then watch Hunter x Hunter. Full metal alchemist is all right as well.

    There are many reviewers on this site who criticize this anime. The one thing I Don't get is that all those reviews have the one and the same thing written in them, i.e It is too long, 700 episodes and counting, don't waste time, more than 200 hours, etc... I would say F*@k all of them, Watch this anime because it is fun, it has great story, characters (except for Nami), Unique art and is enjoyable. If you don't like long anime's don't watch it. it is simple as that. But bashing this anime jus because it is long is not called anime reviewing it is just complaining. The world building in one piece is just awesome, Because of such a big world there are many possibilities of storyline. One piece should be watched arc wise, complete one arc and then leave the anime and then watch another arc after 2 - 3 weeks, it is alright. I am here to tell everyone that those people who go on and on about one piece being bad because of the length are just whiny b*tches, Who wants to get on the hate train because it is a ""TREND"".  
 
Watch this anime it is good 8/10.

    This is a great series (in some areas), and i've found it to be very lovable to many people. The art is very smooth and emotion full, and the characters are, though generally doll, enjoyable. 
One of the only thing dragging this down, is the fact that they've made such a rich number of episodes, that its retarded. Should be cut down to 100 or less, and just end the whole thing soon.  
If they, sometime, decide to do so, ill get my ass back into that series.

    Ok I'm going to try and keep this short.  
 
At the time of this review (episode 759)  
 
Story: amazing. Indepth. All of it seems to be connected. If I were to complain it's that the story can seem repetitive from arc to arc. Another good thing about this anime story is that after looking back at the arcs I found that I enjoyed the filler arcs the most.  
 
There is an art style downgrade from after the time skip that is pretty bad considering what art we have today in anime 
 
Another thing that started idiot aging me post time skip was the incidental music. I mean for 400 episodes it's alright but  by the dressrosa arc I was kind of sick of it.  
 
Anyway if you are new to this series or contemplating weather or not to watch, it's long as hell and only getting longer but it was well worth my time.

    Before i start the review need to say...thank you Eiichiro Oda for create the best anime/manga i've ever seen. 
 
One Piece is a HUGE shonen that was created by eiichiro oda in 1997 and the anime is produced by Toei Animation since 1999. And yes, it STILL making much sucess all around the world. 
 
The curious thing is that Oda planned to One Piece last only 5 years, but the anime has 15 years and the manga 17. And he said that the manga reached the middle last year. Yeah. 
 
The first time i saw One Piece, i was 7 and i remember that i liked it very much. But only 8 years later i started to follow the anime. I started in January, and ""finished"" today, May. Now, I can certainly say what i think about the anime. 
 
Story (10) 
 
At the beginning of OP, the story seems to be poor and cheap. You think like: "" Oh, pirates. He wants to be a king? Oh stop"". But when you get to the episode 60 you can't stop watching. All the story is connected, nothing is in vain. Remember that. Eiichiro is a tricky person. 
 
Art (8) 
 
I like the simple and crazy way that Oda draws. But you know, the grafics are not the best, and the anime is old, so you need to be patient at the beginning of the story. 
 
Sound (9) 
 
I LOVE the ost of One Piece. It feets perfectly with the scenes and the characters. 
 
Character (10) 
 
Each character has you own personality, and this make they special. They are very diferent and funny, but each of them cares a lot with the others. This is the magic of One Piece. Actually,they all are very weird people, with stranges faces, colors, forms and mostly laughs. Yes, in One Piece all the laughs (mostly in the villans) are very very weird. I almost broke my computer once because i hadn't had patient to hear the Moria's laugh 14 times in a episode. 
 
Overall (10) 
 
Ok, you definitely should watch One Piece. Is an epic anime that teaches you to never give up and always protect your friends. If you have never watched, you don't know what is live. And if you don't want to see...errr you gonna see it anyway xx

    I give up. Most people do that before even starting when they see that the series has over 400 episodes. I've watched 490 of them and I just can't take it anymore! I really don't like dropping a series and I generally try to avoid doing so, but the reason to do so is quite plain and simple: this show is a waste of time.  
 
The first few story arcs are really interesting. I've even rewatched the episodes where Zoro joins Luffy a few times since it just really draws me in with its excellent story and characters. It's not like I just ""got used to"" the series and the newer episodes ""seem"" dull because of that; those early episodes were really just amazing. The filler episodes throughout the series are intolerable and water the series down greatly, but the main story arcs are quite interesting and can really hook you. The series kinda loses its charm after a couple hundred episodes, though they still keep it pretty fresh when they introduce a new main character. It's the filler that kills this series, really. 
 
One Piece appears pretty cartoony at first glance, maybe even stupid. Some of the characters look pretty cool despite that (such as Zoro and Trafalgar Law), and it's a little refreshing to see a group of characters that aren't just a bunch of sexy beasts. Characters like Usopp just look unappealing and ridiculous at first, but even a guy like him can seem really cool as his character develops. I've got no problems with the artstyle, and the series has many serious moments that are convincing enough to make you worry about the characters despite the cartoony look.  
 
The long opening themes are one thing, but the long recaps at the start of each episode are brutal and highly unnecessary. I think this problem starts around the Sky Island arc and continues on for the rest of the show. 
Anyhow, I'm quitting at the Marineford war. That was 30 episodes of Luffy endlessly running towards the platform shouting ""ACE!"" while Ace would shout ""LUFFY!"" and ""K...kh...hh...!"", whatever that means. Half of it was just random pirates and marines firing their guns towards off the screen. I think the ""war"" atmosphere was really just boring and not suited to One Piece, especially since the all the fillers made it appear very slowpaced. The show lost its emotion and intensity. There are better things to come, but I can't handle these worthless fillers anymore. One Piece is nearly 500 episodes long and it isn't going to end anytime soon; they're only halfway to One Piece and the real battle is just beginning. I'm sure there'll be peaceful people living happily in the ""New World"" just like in the rest of the Grand Line, though, despite the fact that it's supposed to be the most incredibly dangerous place in the world.  
30 episodes of straight bullshit. Well, I'm sure the worthlessness and stalling amounted to at least 100 episodes. There are some truly incredible series that are only 24 episodes long; you'd do well to watch some of those instead of sitting through One Piece fillers.  
 
I recommend reading the manga instead; no fillers and the art is more interesting. I think I'd give One Piece a 9/10 if it weren't for the fillers. The last point would be saved for an ending, which this series will never have. Don't watch the fillers for completion's sake like I did; they really aren't worth it.

    Well not long ago started watching this series and now have ""watched"" quite lot. And I don't get it how people have so high opinion of this series. 
 
Story:  
Is quite boring honestly, if you like watch same joke 10 * in episode for 700+ episodes then this series might be for you. Nothing interesting happens until Summit War arc. In that arc there was interesting development in characters and connections to other characters. And during that time there Luffy did as he peaces and didn't give a damn what other we're thinking. That is only reason I gave this series even 6, would have been 4 or even 3 without that arc. But at Fishman Island arc it went to back to boring as there doesn't seem to be any reason for any fighting again. 
 
Art: 
Well quality in art is like a roller coaster in this this series, some scenes it is good and some bad. But I like old feeling what art style gives and that's why I rated it to 6. Could have been much higher if quality would be stable good. Color themes are also pretty good in this and seems to be they're not scared to use colors what I'm happy about. 
 
Sound: 
To be honest, nothing too fancy but quality is mostly stable if some side character voice actors not counted in. Music could be better in some situations but good overall. 
 
 
Character(s): 
Well characters in this series are 90% of boring or fanservice. There is literally none character development in this series so I don't get it how this series are even going on anymore. 
 
Luffy: 
Pretty good character but I have watched over 500 episodes and still personality exactly same as beginning of first episode of whole series. As a fighter he is getting stronger but it don't feel like it at all because still sidekicks gives him hard time. I know when they go deeper in Grand line there are stronger mobs but honestly. 
 
Usopp: 
90% of boredom. He don't have growth at all in whole series as person. As a fighter he has grown a little but his personality ruins this character wholly for me, crying help or crying to Luffy to stop all the time. That's everything this character is, nothing more or less. I don't even get a reason of this character because of... 
 
Tony Tony Chopper: 
Chopper are pretty similar to Usopp but he gets things done if situation requires it. Chopper is as character is direct upgrade for Usopp. He cries also Luffy to stop and cries help but if situation requires it he can get things done what Usopp don't. Pretty interesting character and this one I would keep in this series. 
 
Nami: 
This character is 100% of fanservice and nothing else. She don't have anything to give to series and can be also annoying you-know-what. I hoped when I first time saw when she was rescued by Luffy that she is just side character who drops after she's arc end but no. 
 
Zoro: 
This is most interesting character in whole series, he is actually only one who has grown as person in whole crew, and that's pretty sad considered how long this series has already run.  
 
Sanji: 
After Usopp this is second most boring character in whole series. He has not developed as person nor as fighter at all. And his obsession to women joke is gone too long and got boring already. I actually hope he dies on nosebleed somewhere. Not gonna miss him at all. 
 
Brook: 
Can be quite interesting character but feels like he's going to be in same category as Sanji. Same joke over and over again and does not do anything new. At first in Thriller Bark arc he seemed really interesting character and was quite good but when I went to Luffy's boat he went to bottom, he honestly don't give anything new to series and seems to be he is just there for filling Sanji, Usopp and Chopper jokes so they don't repeat same joke 3 jokes whole episode but 4. 
 
Nico Robin: 
Sometimes just for fanservice but much better character than Nami. Personality much better and honestly in a big role to drive story forward. 
 
Franky: 
Last but not least, this character actually got interesting design as a character and he has grown quite lot. I hope they don't ruin this because Franky got a lot potential as MC. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Well as I said in story, this series is quite boring and I have been ""watching"" this. Only ""watching"" not watching cause it's hard to enjoy same jokes over 500 episodes. And usually I keep this rolling for background sound so when I'm doing other things. I actually had quite high hopes for this series because this has run so long but looks like expectations was crushed hard. Most likely I watch this series till it ends but just for background noise, not for entertainment. 
 
Overall: 
Well this section is more like TL;DR for me 
- Do you like watch same joke in every episode till you die? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- Do you like series what are 90% fanservice and otherwise boring? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- Do you like characters don't grow at all (even after 500 episodes)? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- If you want to watch this you can skip straight to Summit War arc cause there really isn't any development in this series so you won't miss anything.

    You know what I really miss? The good ol' days of shonen anime/manga where something could have an outrageously bizarre concept with an equally bizarre universe which can be light in tone and set the stage for some grand adventures to unfold. Nowadays, it seems like most shonen anime and manga try to be all dark and edgy in order to defy those sort of preconceived notions that all shonen anime and manga is light-hearted and/or childish. While that's all fine and dandy, I can't help but feel that we're losing something special in the process of this sort of transition from light-hearted adventures to dark and grim tales of survival.  
 
With the cancellation of the Hunter x Hunter anime (further compounded by the manga's hiatus), it seems like brutal survival games chock full of fan service and outrageously violent battles are all that's left of shonen series. Then enters One Piece: one of the most popular shonen anime/manga series out there which is still going strong despite being around for 15-something years. It's had a lot of ups, downs, and more than its fair share of criticism levied against it but all things considered... it's something like a breath of fresh air in this stale climate that shonen anime/manga seems to have immersed itself in as of late. 
 
***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING*** 
 
One Piece takes place in a world completely dominated by maritime travel that's currently experiencing something known as the ""Golden Age of Pirates."" The ""Golden Age"" was brought about by the death of the so-called Pirate King, Gold Roger and his final words about where he's put his entire life's fortune. Whosoever finds Gold Roger's treasure, the eponymous ""One Piece"" will then become king of the pirates (or so the legend goes; I question how finding a dead man's riches will automatically make you king of all maritime bandits, but that's beside the point). 
 
While many people might dismiss this concept as childish, this is one of the very things I love the most about One Piece. You want to know why? The reason why is that despite the simple set-up would seemingly get repetitive over a short span of time, Eiichiro Oda steps up to the plate and manages to deliver plenty of adventures that are so grand in scope that you'll have a hard time trying to keep your jaw attached to your face. The way that Oda manages to so is quite clever and something that I never really get tired of: the fact that the Grand Line (the place where the vast majority of One Piece takes place in) is pretty much a perfect canvas to unleash his creative mind. 
 
The Grand Line is literally a place where common sense won't get you anywhere. Conventional means of navigation are impossible because each island emits its own, strong magnetic field that interferes with regular compasses. Instead, you need a special compass called a ""log pose"" which basically leads you to the next island and that island is completely random. In addition to that, it takes a certain amount of time for the log pose to reset itself and lead you to the next island. The log pose can change at a moment's notice, so you can't even trust the calm of the seas or the weather. On that note, weather in the Grand Line is incredibly chaotic due to the irregular magnetic field that encompasses the entire area.  
 
On the topic of weather, every island in the Grand Line has its own climate, fauna, and such. Some islands are cloaked in perpetual winter while other islands are quite literally stuck in prehistoric times with dinosaurs and everything. Going back to the log pose, sometimes it can point you to seemingly impossible locations. Would you believe that there's an entire arc in One Piece that takes place on an island IN THE FUCKING SKY?!?! I'm not even kidding. Whenever Eiichiro Oda puts his mind to it, he really can surprise you with what he can come up with. In fact, when it comes down to the world-building, only Fullmetal Alchemist and Hunter x Hunter come close to matching it. Of course, One Piece and HxH opt for a sort of ""make it up as you go along"" approach while Fullmetal Alchemist is more carefully crafted. 
 
A rather important part of One Piece's universe is the existence of the so-called ""Devil Fruits."" Whosoever devours one of these strange fruits will be given great power at the expense of their ability to swim. It should be noted that throughout the entirety of One Piece (thus far), there is absolutely NO explanation behind the mechanics of Devil Fruits and their effects on humans. Some people will undoubtedly take umbrage with this, but I don't. One of the things that irritate me the most when it comes down to shonen anime and manga in recent years is the fact that there's always NEEDS to be an explanation to EVERY SINGLE THING.  
 
Don't get me wrong, there's always going to be shit that will need explaining, but I find it infuriating whenever there has to be some sort of pseudo-scientific explanation given for practically EVERYTHING that happens to our characters whenever they gain/use a superpower. In One Piece, the Devil Fruit superpowers are indeed important but they're not the overall focus of the plot. I suppose you can consider the Devil Fruit powers to be analogous to Nen from Hunter x Hunter or chakra from Naruto if you need something you can compare it to (even then, it's not quite like those two). Another thing to note is that no two Devil Fruits will bestow the exact same power. 
 
***THE STORY*** 
 
One of the biggest problems that the One Piece anime suffers from is a VERY slow start. Like most shonen series, the story of One Piece is told arcs. The first 61 or so episodes encompass what I like to call the ""East Blue"" arc (which comprises of several smaller sub-arcs). Basically, it's where Luffy is recruiting his crew and the various adventures that follow suit. By the end of Episode 31, the final crew member joins and the team is ready to set sail to the Grand Line... although that's not quite the case. After Sanji joins the team, Nami briefly defects as we go into an arc that dives into her own back-story before she returns and becomes a permanent fixture of the Straw Hat pirates. 
 
It's not that these episodes are bad or anything, but I just got done telling you all this amazing shit that happens in the previous section and yet none of that shit actually goes down until AFTER these episodes. Well... to be fair, these episodes were produced well over a decade ago when the manga itself was still rather young. I suppose it's like Phantom Blood from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in the sense that it at least provides us with the foundation for these grand adventures to unfold. At the same time, I can't help but feel like Toei Animation could've at least skipped over some of the more superfluous stuff from the manga. Whatever, it's too late to do anything about that now. 
 
Aside from that, the story of One Piece is pretty damn good. For a series that's been going on for well over 15 years, it's surprising as to how consistent the overall story quality remains across the board. Yes, there are points where the storytelling takes a downturn, but this generally happens in filler arcs and whenever there's some excruciating padding in an episode to stretch out the chapters (more in the next section). Of course, there are also moments whenever you can tell that Oda didn't quite bring his A-game to the table in a particular arc. Yes, a man like Eiichiro Oda can also suffer from dry spells where his storytelling isn't quite up-to-par with what he usually brings to the table. He IS human, after all. 
 
Considering that One Piece is a shonen series, it's no surprise that themes of friendship and loyalty are quite prominent. What's more is that in a vein similar to ""classic"" shonen series like Dragon Ball, it's going to be a tale of adventure that is rather light in tone (for the most part). Does this mean that One Piece is automatically childish garbage? HELL TO THE FUCKING NO. Surprisingly enough, One Piece is fairly capable of taking itself seriously when the time comes for it to do so and what's more is that friendship/loyalty will ALWAYS be themes no matter what since those are hallmarks of the genre. No sense in complaining about something that's part of the course, you know... 
 
The overall arc structure of One Piece is fairly predictable, but that's not an inherently bad thing since it does offer a degree of consistency with the storytelling. The basic formula generally goes like this: the Straw Hats land on an island -> residents of the island hate them -> the Straw Hats meet the island's bad guy(s) -> they beat the bad guys -> residents of the island now love the Straw Hats. Keep in mind that this is simply the framework for an arc and the way an arc actually plays out may very well end up surprising you. This goes back to One Piece's greatest strength: giving us amazing adventures that are so grand in scope to the point where you can't look away from the screen for a moment. 
 
***THE FILLER*** 
 
Surprisingly enough, Toei Animation did a relatively good job of remaining filler-free in a series as long as One Piece (roughly 98 episodes). It also helps that most of the filler arcs tend to be rather short (typically 2-5 episodes) across 670 episodes. It also helps that a good portion of them basically got their origins from ideas that Eiichiro Oda wanted to put in the manga but couldn't for various reasons. But does that mean they're worth watching? Well... I suppose you can go ahead and sit through the filler but the G8, Ice Hunter, and Ocean's Dream arcs are the only ones that I consider worth watching since the other filler arcs tend to be more hit/miss. 
 
Going back to how Toei Animation mostly managed to subvert filler, it was through adaptation expansion. Eiichiro Oda is a guy who packs quite a lot of detail into his stories, so it's easy for writers to expand upon concepts he brought up but didn't quite flesh out. Unfortunately, Toei Animation has this nasty habit of taking things too far. While the adaptation expansion was good enough that occasionally bordered on great in the first half of the anime, the latter half of the series (Episode 405-onward) is where Toei Animation's adaptation expansion takes a downward turn for the worse. 
 
After the Sabaody arc, Toei Animation decided to up and scrap the idea for filler episodes entirely and instead adapt the chapters at a 1:1 ratio. Considering the fact that not every chapter will have ~20 minutes' worth of stuff to adapt, Toei Animation had to improvise and they did so by means of VERY excruciating padding. It REALLY got ridiculous in the Marineford arc where you're basically panning over shots of the crew and have to put up with Buggy's pitiful attempts at comedy. It even got to a point where they showed one character looking for milk before going back to a fight. Now with that said, it DOES get better and it's really noticeable after the time skip but it's too little, too late by that point since the time skip is fairly recent (around episode 515?). 
 
***THE CHARACTERS*** 
 
Considering the fact that One Piece has been going on for 15+ years, it's no surprise that there would be a LOT of characters. A good deal of them show up later on in the show/manga's run, but the vast majority of them are more or less just there for one arc before the focus of the story shifts to the next arc. Surprisingly enough though, even characters that have been around for just one arc were fairly well-developed and rather likeable like Dr. Kureha whose only appearance is in the Drum Island arc. There are certain characters who stick around with the Straw Hats for more than one arc (i.e. Vivi), but they're few and far between. Despite that, they receive more than enough screen time to the point where you feel like something's missing once the time comes for them to depart. 
 
For the vast majority of One Piece, we're stuck with the Straw Hat pirates: a rag-tag bunch of misfits with their own share of issues that also have such large bounties on their heads that rival Vash the Stampede's. The leader of the Straw Hats is none other than the rubbery Monkey D. Luffy. For lack of better words, Luffy is well... an idiot. What's more is that he's a gluttonous idiot in a vein similar to Goku or Naruto but thankfully he's not THAT extreme. A good benchmark as to how much you'll like Luffy is how well you can tolerate his airhead behaviour since it does get rather ridiculous at times. Regardless, he's got quite a few good traits to back him up and without Luffy, there would be no adventure, which would fucking SUCK. 
 
My favourite character would definitely have to be a tie between Roronoa Zoro (the swordsman) and Sanji (the chef). Why? Well... it's a combination of cool factor AND the fact that they play off of each other (and Luffy) rather well. I just can't get enough of their constant snark toward one another, nor can I ever get enough of Zoro's santoryu (3-sword style) or Sanji's ridiculously powerful kicks. That's not to say that the rest of the Straw Hats are forgettable, boring, or whatever because that is NOT the case at all. What I love most about the Straw Hats is that despite the predominant focus on Luffy, each member receives a good amount of development and time to shine on-screen. 
 
Of course, what are protagonists without their villains? Suffice it to say, Eiichiro Oda's creativity leads to us having quite a lot of interesting villains. Some of them are fucking AWESOME (like Enel in the Skypiea arc) while others are well... lame and stupid (like Buggy in the Orange Town arc). Honestly, this is something you'll have to put up with over the course of One Piece. You think that a limitless well of creativity is free? Oh fuck no! While Eiichiro Oda manages to hit the mark 95% of the time, there are moments where you have to put up with some of his ideas for villains that aren't stupid in an awesome way but are instead just well... stupid (ref: Buggy). Thankfully, arc villains aren't the only ones that the Straw Hats have to deal with. 
 
Considering the fact that the Grand Line is so vast in scope, there are a LOT of threats that the Straw Hats have to put up with, two of which being the Marines and the Seven Warlords of the Sea. The Marines are essentially your maritime police force which deals with pirates while the Seven Warlords are essentially government-sanctioned pirates. In exchange for a cut of the treasure that the Seven Warlords find, the government allows them to basically pick off smaller pirate ships that try to traverse through the Grand Line. Whenever an arc deals with one of the Seven Warlords, there's no doubt that it will be intense.   
 
***THE ART AND ANIMATION*** 
 
If the seemingly childish concept, Luffy's stupidity, or the sheer length won't repulse you, chances are that the artwork will make or break your overall experience. Personally, I feel like Eiichiro Oda's artwork has quite a unique charm to it. What I love most about it is that there isn't a single anime/manga series out there that has this exact art style (and before you say anything, Fairy Tail does NOT count). I can understand why some people wouldn't like it since it's rather cartoony and most shonen series nowadays tend to have realistic character designs. Regardless, Hunter x Hunter has a similar ""cartoony"" art style and yet people praise the everliving Christ out of it so if you're gonna talk smack about One Piece's artwork but not levy the same criticism against Hunter x Hunter, you're too stupid for words. 
 
Of course... there is one little gripe I have with the art style and that is the fan service. Seriously... One Piece's fan service is something that I can never quite get accustomed to despite having watched the anime AND read the manga for well over 6-7 years. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't find huge tits on top of a skinny waist and lanky limbs to be that attractive. If that weren't bad enough, post-timeskip Nami's outfit is essentially a bikini-top and low-riding pants. Come on, Oda! You expect me to believe that Nami just went through a growth spurt? Don't lie, she paid Chopper to give her a boob job and you know it. Same goes for Nico as well! But, I digress. While I can certainly complain about it all I want, the fan service isn't as bad as OTHER popular shonen series (i.e. Akame ga Kill, Fairy Tail). 
 
As for the actual animation itself, it pains me to say that Toei Animation doesn't really have that good of a track record when it comes down to animation quality because they have this nasty habit of producing several long-running anime series alongside one another as they're airing while rotating between animation teams that tend to vary wildly in terms of quality. There's a tendency to go off model every few episodes and it's actually gotten a lot sloppier in the more recent episodes with character proportioning changing at the drop of a hat (let's hope that these animation errors get fixed in an upcoming Blu-ray release or something). 
 
The first 206 episodes were more or less par for the course from Toei Animation. There was a lot of good, a good deal of penny pinching along the way, fights were decently animated but nothing worth getting excited over, etc. Episode 207 is when the show makes the switch to HD and a 16:9 resolution and from that point forward, the animation became more fluid and the artwork became a lot cleaner as it ditched some of the line effects and such that it used in the earlier episodes. A general rule of thumb I use is that if an episode I'm watching on Funimation's website has been dubbed, I'll watch the dub instead because dubbed anime generally uses the footage AFTER it's been cleaned up of most of its off-model errors. 
 
***THE SOUNDTRACK*** 
 
Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot about One Piece's OST that really caught the fancy of my ears which is quite bizarre since there's usually one or two pieces of BGM that would stand out to my ears while watching. The OP/ED themes are fair enough, and I do have a fondness for a few of them (although I forget their numbers and I'm WAY too lazy to look them up at this point). I will say this though: Skypiea had some pretty damn good BGM even though I couldn't remember any specific tracks that stood out. 
 
***THE DUBS*** 
 
If you've ever done a basic Google search on One Piece, you'll probably find out that it had a rather turbulent distribution history here in the USA. It was initially picked up by 4Kids Entertainment and was aired on FOX during Saturday mornings (only to eventually air on Toonami during Saturday nights). Unfortunately, 4Kids has this nasty habit of editing the anime they license WAY past the point of compliance with FCC guidelines. For a full list of 4Kids edits, you can Google it. Most One Piece fans will urge you to stay away from the dub and honestly... I can't really blame them for that (especially now, since Funimation has been distributing One Piece for damn near 7 years and their dub is significantly better). 
 
But if we were to take away the content edits that 4Kids was responsible for and focus solely on the actual dubbing, you'd be quite surprised. The actual dubbing isn't quite bad and if you want a real surprise, Marc Diraison (the voice of Guts in the English dub of Berserk) voices Roronoa Zoro in the 4Kids dub of One Piece. It's no stretch of the imagination to think that he's my favourite performance in the entire dub. Erica Schroeder, the voice of Luffy did a fair enough job in her role but some of her lines came off as a bit forced and unnatural (although I blame the ADR director for that, since the woman really is a talented voice actress). 
 
As for the Funimation dub, I'd have to say that it's pretty damn good stuff. It's common to hear dub haters say that Colleen Clinkenbeard as Luffy and Brina Palencia as Tony Tony Chopper make their ears bleed, but that judgement is really left up to you. Both Clinkenbeard and Palencia do a great job with the roles they've been given, but I will concede that they can get rather irritating at times (of course, I blame the characters since their voices can be grating in the Japanese dub too). However, my favourite performances would definitely have to be Luci Christian as Nami and Christopher Sabat as Zoro (although I wish that Marc Diraison was still Zoro's voice actor because Guts). It's nice to hear Luci Christian's regular voice and Christopher Sabat not being a large ham and I wish more Funi dubs would play them straight rather than having Christian and Sabat doing exaggerated roles. 
 
***ANIME VS. MANGA/HOW TO WATCH*** 
 
When it comes down to anime vs. manga, the manga always wins hands-down for one simple reason: lack of padding. Were it not for Toei Animation's overuse of padding, I'd heartily recommend the anime over the manga since it does have quite a lot going for it. However, it should be noted that you can alternate between the anime and the manga so that you don't have to plough through 760+ chapters or spend 6 months trying to catch up to the One Piece anime. Thankfully, the One Piece wikia can tell you what chapter(s) the episode you're watching is adapting and vice-versa. 
 
Rather than sitting through the first 61 episodes, what I recommend is reading the first 100 or so chapters from the manga (it's not as much as it sounds, trust me) and then moving over to the anime at Episode 62. If you ever feel like an episode is dragging on in pace, look up the episode on the One Piece wikia and see what chapter(s) it's adapting, then go ahead and read the corresponding chapter so you don't have to sit through 20+ minutes of something that you could easily read in less than 3-4 minutes. If you feel like the chapter you're reading is confusing or whatever, look it up on the One Piece wiki and then watch the corresponding episode. It's as simple as that, really. What made you think you had to sit through all 670+ episodes to begin with? The manga does exist for a reason. 
 
***FINAL THOUGHTS*** 
 
On the whole, One Piece is a very interesting beast to tackle. I like to imagine One Piece as the boss of the Big 3 with Naruto and Bleach standing by its side as its bumbling and incompetent henchmen. While the sheer episode count and turbulent distribution history may put you off from watching it, don't let that scare you. Whereas Studio Pierrot only began adapting Naruto and Bleach in 2005, One Piece has been going on since 1999 so of course there's going to be a stark difference in terms of episode count. For a series that's been going on for 15 years and counting with no end in sight any time soon, it's amazing as to how Eiichiro Oda is able to keep up this level of creativity. Are there low points? Of course, but thankfully they aren't THAT low and are instead very brief. Don't buy into the hate against this series since it's actually quite lovely. 
 
***ALTERNATE ANIME RECOMMENDATIONS*** 
 
1) Hunter x Hunter (2011) 
- The bonds between Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio are similar to the bonds shared between the Straw Hat pirates and what's more is that they both take place in bizarre worlds where fanciful occupations set the stage for tales of grand adventures just waiting to unfold. 
 
2) InuYasha 
- Both InuYasha and One Piece are more about the journey rather than the destination itself. Both shows comprise of large arcs that are split up between many smaller, easy-to-watch sub-arcs and standalone episodes. Both shows also put a lot of emphasis on friendship and trust (although InuYasha does so for different reasons; it IS a partially romantic story, after all).

    ONE PIECE EITHER GOING TO BE A LOVEABLE ANIME OR A HATEFUL ANIME FOR YOU. BELOW I WILL SHARE MY EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING ONE PIECE. 
 
 
Story 
 
The story is simple. It's somewhat drowned on most of the time. The fighting is ok and very entertaining to watch at times. On the other hand, the action is bad compared to other anime. The most stupid thing is how Luffy just randomly pulls power out of nowhere when needed -.-. Let him lose properly, let us see him gain strength, not just randomly give him magic powers in the next episode. Hunter x Hunter is a great example of showing to the audience how Gon gained his strength. 
 
Overall the let-down is in between the start of the arc to the end (meaning pretty much the whole story). During these times one piece finds a way to add lousy speech, action and can add a cheesy sad story to make the audience try to relate to it, just doesn't work. For this reason, I am giving the story 4/10 
 
Animation & Sound:  
 
One Piece animation is unique and can draw you in. The arts get better and better as the story progress. It's the same story with sound. However, you would expect the success of one piece would let it improve the animation standard to 2013/2014. It still lacks quality compared to animation that came years before now. For this reason, I am giving both of them 5/10 
 
Characters:  
 
One Piece universe has a wide a wide range of characters. The main crew is fun to watch but also can be annoying at times. The downside is newer characters are just not getting their screen time worth. We don't want to wait for another 100 episodes to find another fact about them. Well, I guess they done it to drown the anime on. Another downside to characters I would say is the villains for Zoro. I mean come on! One of the biggest badass in the anime yet they can't even be bothered to create a more interesting character without a cheesy or disinteresting story to fight him. Overall I give it 5/10 for the poor background information on the characters we are given. 
 
Overall:  
 
Overall, if this is the first anime you chose to watch, you might enjoy. If you have seen other anime that set the bar high, such as FMA, then you will be disappointed. The newer arcs just feel like Oda is doing his best to try and rake in money rather than continuing putting soul into the anime. 
 
However, I would say that it can be enjoyable for a younger audience or someone who is new to the anime world. 
 
Overall rating for the anime: 5/10

    One Piece is honestly the most amazing series I have ever watched or read.  The plots are well-written and hold my attention without taking themselves too seriously and adding unnecessary drama that causes me to lose interest.  The characters are some of the most endearing, well-developed and likable characters and the art, while not appealing to me at first, took a grand total of TWO episodes to get used to before I found it to be incredibly unique and my favorite anime art style to date. 
 
While this series has serious moments, it never stops being funny.  Something important about the humor in this series is that it's ORIGINAL.  None of the typical jokes that are recycled in every anime and even the serious moments I was talking about are sprinkled with clever and endearing humor that keeps me watching. 
 
Something that is important to me in a series is the characters.  If I don't like characters, chances are, I'm not going to like the series.  The lead cast to One Piece has won me over in their own individual ways.  There is not a single one I don't like and I seriously thought that was IMPOSSIBLE. 
 
I could go on and on about this series but it's not my job to tell you EVERYTHING great about it!  Just take my word on it!

    One Piece is a freak show. With over 800 episodes aired so far, there's no end in sight. 
 
So One Piece is a battle shounen anime, which follows the adventures of one Monkey D. Luffy, who aspires to be the King of the Pirates. He is the captain of the Strawhat Pirates, a crew consisting of both males and females, who all play an important role that helps keep the crew going. 
 
Luffy is our typical, dumb shounen hero, who is a glutton, grins a lot, and is happy-go-lucky. He is a rubber man, whom can stretch parts of his body, gaining this ability after eating one of these ""Devil Fruits"" when he was younger. The rest of the Strawhat Pirates all have unique personalities, with their own quirks, and you're likely to find a favourite among them. Although, some of them can be annoying sometimes. 
 
The art style is something you'll either love or hate. It can be either appealing or unappealing to look at. In my case, I don't have a problem with it, and that there are worse-looking anime than One Piece. It's quite cartoony, and has a distinguishing look to it. The designs of the Strawhat Pirates look fine. But it has some of the ugliest-looking supporting characters you will find in an anime. 
 
The animation is ass. Produced by the infamous Toei Animation, the animation is average and just looks outdated compared to other long-running anime that aired (or is airing) around the same time. It's just disappointing and I know it could look better if another studio had done it, or if Toei put more budget into it like in the films. Along with this, the fights (which are mindless) just look unimpressive and are dull compared to the fights in other battle shounen anime (like Naruto and Bleach), and it also uses a lot of still frames. There are also no fluidly-animated episodes for the episodes with high-action scenes either. Barely any of the fights are memorable, they don't have strategy, nor do they have any rewatch value, and the choreography for the fights are just lame. This isn't a show you want to watch for the fights. 
 
The sound effects are somewhat annoying. I personally hate the sound effect of a heart beating. The music is a mixed bag. It's upbeat most of the times, which goes well with the theme of the show. The first opening sounds amazing, and made me revisit the show frequently early on, but other openings are just painful to listen to. The main characters have their own theme music, which I always liked the idea of in anime in general, and they fit with the characters. The voice acting in both the sub and dub are great. I personally prefer the dub. 
 
The pacing is fine from episodes 2 to 301 (episode 1 was slow-paced), but it becomes permanently slow-paced starting from episode 302. Most of the filler episodes are surprisingly decent. Though in latter episodes, there are almost no filler episodes to speak of, which results in snail-pacing for the canon episodes. 
 
There are some things that have always annoyed me while watching this show, other than the fights. There is a lot of crying in it, from both main and supporting characters. Not only that, but they make these ugly, exaggerated expressions on their faces when they cry. It's probably a staple of the show, but it feels like they went way overboard with the tears, and it gets irritating the more you watch it and hear them wailing. Accompanying this is the constant melodrama. Hate that shit. It tries too hard to make the viewers cry. 
 
Another thing is the lack of deaths. Basically, for the most part, nobody dies in this show (outside of flashbacks). Like nobody. This got noticeable the more I watched it, and I found it a bit annoying. Like I wasn't expecting any characters to die within the first 100 episodes or anything, but damn, does it take a long-ass time for the first actual death to take place in the show (we're talking about hundreds of episodes). I don't mind lack of deaths in an anime that has a realistic setting, but One Piece has a fantasy setting, and it's unacceptable to me for a fantasy anime like this have virtually no deaths. What also irks me are the moments where the show makes it look like somebody has died, but later on you find out that they didn't. After realising how rare deaths are in this show, I just roll my eyes whenever a character, in a non-flashback scene, says that they're going to kill or decapitate another character. And speaking of flashbacks, why do most of the characters have to have overly tragic backstories? I get it! They had it rough! Stop making me feel sorry for everyone! 
 
I also don't really like the humour; it's just childish and involves slapstick and retorting. In other words, it's mostly unfunny, at least to me. And I just don't like the general tone of the series. You often see these minor, nameless characters scream their lines to whatever is going on in front of them in a silly way in dramatic moments, and it's pretty annoying. And the anime in general is a bit too goofy at times compared to other battle shounens. 
 
Overall, the main characters are the strongest aspect of the anime, and is the biggest reason why I try to continue to watch the anime. I admit it's fun to see the Strawhat crew's adventures. It's a pretty silly show, not taking itself seriously at all. However, the abundance of melodrama might be a turn-off for some people. The arcs are also formulaic for the most part, so it gets repetitive too. If you have a lot of time on your hands, and like adventure, then consider checking this show out. If you're looking for a battle shounen with spectacular fights, then I suggest you look elsewhere. The fights in One Piece are crap. I myself grew tired of watching this show after the Thriller Bark saga. The show peaks in the Marineford arc, and there's little reason to continue watching this show after the timeskip.

    I never write reviews but I think this series deserves it. 
 
NOTE: This is obviously not a bad-ass/cool-mysterious guy on a seemingly complex mission that is trying to mind-fuck you. This is SHOUNEN. Straight-forward and easy to understand for younger viewers and deep enough for the older. This is business as well as entertainment ei: MAINSTREAM. 
 
Sure it has a VERY generic shounen anime base-line but it has a lot more depth to it that only a mature audience can understand. This can't be seen within the first 20 episodes; it's one of those things where you have to grin and bare with. Most likely, your efforts would be worthwhile. 
 
I'll just follow the trend and comment on the sections; starting with the weakest qualities. 
 
 
 
1. ART: (6/10) 
 
This is a HUGE issue and it takes a lot of perseverance and patience to get used to the art style of this anime. It took me about 6 months to get used to it. 
At first, everyone looked like overly-hyper, 12 year-olds being too loud and just looking at them made me want to stop. Noodle-like arms and legs, weird anatomy etc. the list goes on. But if you power through however long it takes for you to get used to the art, the characters appear as catalysts of nothing but pure emotion. This puts you in a weird, neutral position. You know that the art isn't great but you can't seem to imagine this series in any other way. Changing the art style becomes a bad idea. 
 
The only reason why I'm giving the art style a 6/10 is because it's so damn hard to swallow. In the end, anime isn't just eye-candy, it's storytelling first and foremost and I think One Piece knows this very well. 
 
 
 
2. SOUND: (8/10) 
 
The sound in this series isn't bad but it isn't spectacular though it does have golden moments during heavily emotional scenes. What IS fantastic is the seiyuu's performances throughout this colossal series. They (generally) capture the essence of their characters, flaws and all. For example: The annoying idiot aspects of Luffy. Mayumi Tanaka was THE voice for Luffy. No one could fill her shoes. 
The opening themes usually sets the correct tone for the series; an up-beat, ""let's go on an adventure"" kind of feeling. Corny? Maybe, Childish? Very, Effective? Absolutely. 
For what One Piece is and what it does; the sounds in the series definitely supports. It's doesn't suit my taste in music but it's very ""One Piece"", which adds to the experience. 
 
 
 
3. STORY: (10/10) 
 
The depth of this story will surprise anyone. I had very low expectations for this series, having started years after it began airing but after watching it for a while, I truly believe that this is one of the best shounen stories to date. 
 
Despite being from a very obvious shounen base-line, One Piece delivers fantastically. One Piece explores society in a very extreme manner; often exaggerated to enhance the hype of the moment. You can see that this is deliberate because of how everything within the story drives to one particular moment.  
 
I don't think One Piece's story should be compared to reality because it's simply not realistic: It's not supposed to be but we can certainly compare and relate the ideas and themes within the plot. 
 
This is a truly well thought-out plot, beautifully integrated with the characters to provide a very wholesome experience. If you sit there and watch it -searching for flaws- you will be missing the point of One Piece. If you approach it with a ""What the hell but whatever, lets see how this goes"" attitude, you are guaranteed to enjoy this plot more. 
 
NOTE: Fillers are NOT stories, they fill empty spaces. That's why they're called 'fillers'. They are meant to be half-assed to buy time for the author. You can't judge a series by fillers, that just means you're stupid. 
 
 
 
4. CHARACTER: (10/10) 
 
First impressions are important when it comes to characters. Unfortunately, One Piece fails at this and fails pretty hard. We are introduced to a very typical hero, off to be some king of something and be the biggest, baddest man on town: in this case, the world. Then we meet a typical tough-guy/Mr. Cool. etc. 
The thing that is amazing about the characters in One Piece is that though they appear very standard; they somehow manage to break their cookie-cutter mold. Each character basically has one strong quality about them but that one aspect of their character is what makes each character special. 
 
They then develop as the story progresses; being faced with challenges each character's physical, mental and emotional state to their limits; tests their judgment and instincts. They are never perfect but it's how they work around their shortcomings and utilize their few strong aspects to survive in the hostile world of One Piece, that puts the characters of One Piece in a league of their own. 
 
Once you get used to the whole atmosphere of this series, you will find that you won't be able to help but feel very attached to almost every character you come across. 
 
 
 
5. ENJOYMENT: (10/10) 
 
It's fabulous. I can't think of any other series with this much depth; in character design and the execution of the plot. There is a lot to read into in this series, people just need to take a deep breathe and allow themselves to be drowned and suffocated by it. It won't kill you I promise. 
 
 
 
6. OVERALL: (10/10) 
 
I obviously love this series. It's completely underrated and is constantly being flamed by 'mature viewers' that think they've actually grown up just because they watch brain-raping anime with what SEEMS like a complicated plot when it's actually just another generic anime to their related genre. 
 
This series deserves a lot more than that. It is worth the trouble of getting used to the painful art style. It is worth credit. There IS a reason why it's popular. 
We, in the Western world tend to think that it's mind-boggling to see that THIS is one of their most popular animes but I think it's our arrogance and denial that is causing this negative reaction. Apparently, anime is just pretty colors, characters with big eyes and crazy hair, and big tits or a scifi-novel with moving pictures. 
 
One Piece is a fantastic combination of business, entertainment and art. It's obvious why this series is such a success in it's homeland. It's just tragic how a disgrace to mankind (4Kids Entertainment) got hold of this gem before it could reach a wider audience. 
 
This is not a masterpiece; but it's pretty damn close to being one. 
There is no such thing as a perfect show.

    OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! 
 
From a scale of ""over 9000"" to ""too damn high"", how autistic am I You say? 
well judging from watching this garbage I'd say a 9 will suffice for the  
after effect. 
 
I like it, but in all honesty its not good. 
So To begin my review, Let me start of my experience of watching OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!!  
 
Please do understand this is not me taking shots at this series in any way, this is just me expressing my views on the show in terms of its merits and failings to see if its as great as fans really suggest this to be. 
 
For a long time you see I've watched the series of One Piece back on television during the great Toonami era which basically is The western TV version of saying HELLO JAPAN!!  
 
The dub for 4kids was what I watched at first and no surprise It deserved it at the time because the show wasn't that special from the get go from when it started off to where its currently at now with DOH Flippin Flamingo.  
 
And yes I went to funimation and the japanese for there take on its characters voice and music etc which still did not make any difference apart from seeing some dumb unrealistic violence and yet the show still hasn't grown up to where I am now in the series, it could be possibly I'm not acknowledging the show in the right way despite that I'm still watching it or maybe Oda just isn't Goda anymore 
OH NOOO! THE HORROR!!. 
 
The Basic story premise is about pirates with super fruity power ups known as Devil Fruits (Laughing excessively here at this point) 
More to It lies with our main character Monkey D Luffy a wannabe young man who wants to be king of the pirates. 
(Wow had no idea there was royalty to begin with pirates but oh well) 
 
Luffy strings up a group of people to join his pirate crew within different arcs of the story to help in searching for a treasure known as OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! that was foretold by the greatest pirate known as  
Gold D Rodgers who apparently hides the treasure in the Grand Line (because thats the name of the big game I guess?) and by the time our hair turns grey we might actually find out as to why and what it is, (that is either you or Oda stays alive until then.) 
 
At the time of Gold D Rodger's death sentence he makes his last infinite statement that he says he left everything in OnePiIISSWuaaaa! 
 
Oh yes Gotta love that D eh Boys and Girls ? 
 
So far in the midst of everything the story tries its hardest to keep building up and gets messed up at an early point right after 50 episodes which was supposed to be its greatest strength but also becomes its greatest weakness.  
 
You probably wont believe me for saying this but that weakness being is WORLD BUILDING.  
 
Basically what I mean by that is constant dragging on of episodes to make you feel that you are on a long journey of some sorts but in reality,  
All it really is doing is STALLING on the part of the mangaka Oda Eiichiro's Art design and writing for whatever wage he seems to be earning on demand at the moment and yes its fact since the industry supposedly is hard on the condition of writers on a weekly basis. In other words the PACING OF THIS ANIME IS AWFUL.  
 
Sounds familiar?? Its pretty much very similar to Hunter X Hunter mangaka Togashi Yoshihiro's approach in the story that constitutes for being excessively greedy in its approach, then again quite a lot of Shounen animes are like that I guess. 
 
Its like the anime is holding up a sign saying:  
HEY NOTICE US PLEASE!! PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF US! OR WE'LL KEEP SLOWING DOWN FOR WE SEEK THE ATTENTION!!!!  
 
Anyway enough of the issue at hand before some of you start feeling like I'm trying too hard to be negative on purpose. 
 
Think to yourself THIS, If this was such a great shounen for examples like death note or even FMA Brotherhood why the need for SO many episodes??  
 
Why am I so serious..?? 
 
very simple answer, Again its World building! which demands many SLOW pacing in a lot of episodes, So much so that they probably need LOADS of spin off specials and movies like you haven't watched enough of this already as it is in and outside of this franchise,  
(also referring to Japanese one piece merchandise of course.) 
 
by the time you get your toys at whatever time period this show continues, you ALL would of already grown out of this at some stage in your life unless your an Otaku then fair enough. 
 
This is No Rant here, I'm only stating the obvious critical point towards the show as a whole. But like I mentioned its because of this World Building this  leads to the major reason why the story at most becomes tedious and below mediocre at best on a consistent level in almost EVERY Arc.  
 
Oh and also FILLERS whether the fandom wants you to know or not know, there are a lot of filler characters which also includes badly forced gags for no progressive purposes except for you to question say ''Hey maybe I should watch something else for the time being,'' and me being an honest critic of this generation I will gladly say this, that You should not be force to be put through too much of the same stuff that you don't really want to SEE in a long series like this. 
 
Can we be honest and say for any anime watchers out there that loads of episode can harm World building because of timing and pacing problems such as this?  
When you are chock full of content like this, it should be constructed and executed better! Never mind the BS on the whole it started in the 90s kinda nonsense. 
 
YOU have the content for viewers to be engage in the show yet this anime stretches out the same shit you already witness before without some even realising it (Naruto I'm looking at you on this notion here).  
So don't go into this series thinking there ain't gonna be any fillers because I can most assure you there are, and quite a lot of them even if some of the extreme fandom don't seem to believe so. 
 
The Art is okay and at the same time can look very BAD in terms of the details of a lot of characters. marines look stupid and quite similar to one another and just well fodder really, 
 
females in this series turn out to have the same physique as every other hour glass shaped female in the show. wait is this fairy tail??  
(Oh boy I might of hit the nail on that one) 
 
Big tall men have extremely wide bodies and extremely skinny legs for no reason, at least whitebeard is the more convincing one out of them. 
 
Other characters which includes non human characters look ridiculous and just too nonsensical to be taken seriously not matter what dragon ball like power they seem to possess. 
almost like I'm watching a Disney cartoon back in the day if it was on LSD.  
and for the love of god why is usopp's nose a DILDO?? 
 
I don't care what third dimension of Disney this is suppose to be?  
THIS does not appeal to me thank you. 
 
Now on to The Power schemes and structures of OnePiIISSWuaaaa! such as  
Paramecia:  
Body manipulation over their own bodies, environment, or produce substances. 
Logia:  
having the power of natural elements or force of nature. 
Zoan:  
Transformation of species and inter-species hybrid forms at will. 
 
Ah, you would think this category would be solid?  
While some powers in the series I'll admit can be used to good effect, others can look completely ridiculous and nonsensical even in their own category which for the most part makes the power balance of this series  
even more unbalanced.  
 
Oh and lastly 
Haki AKA (Haki of the Color of the Conquering King): Domination of the wills of others is the dumbest made up BULLSHIT! in the entirety of this franchise. 
(Oh wow Conquerors Haki! OMG! That guy just looked at another person and that person fell DOWN!! OMG!!) seriously? 
 
NO SERIOUSLY,  
Don't get me started talking about the different fighting styles in this series, its lame and not worth mentioning for they are like an excuse for characters that have to fight for the sake of having fights as their only true purpose and nothing more. 
 
Villains in this show are typically One dimensional, There the kind of villains that like to displays cruel tendencies to other characters that you really wouldn't care for, 
BUT I guess because the straw hats appear (Oh Whoopie) You are force to unfortunately,  
at times It can seem some what tiresome Especially if you are already familiar with this Shounen pattern again and again and again and AGAIN.  
 
How long has this series been going on for? (No Seriously) 
 
So now on to characters where the show for the most part kind of develops, but only due to back stories to further a fully purposed plot for them later on from the get go but it never really makes ground breaking attempts to carry along in this stride in every arc which is a real shame. 
 
So this wouldn't really be shocking up to this point, ESPECIALLY if you have already watched a shit ton of episodes till the current episode you are at right now. 
 
Main Characters The simple short version. 
 
Luffy: IMO, as the Lead character he is one of the most uninspiring main character leads I've ever seen in shounen he has 2 fixated moods DUMBASS Or Constipated Raging Man child, Take your pick. 
 
Zoro: is useless in direction making the punt of his efforts in lots of situations where he is lost at every turn very stupid which in turn leaves his three swords style.  
But then who cares when you see characters like Killer Bee from naruto who uses his own 8 swords style So right off the bat what so impressive about this 3 swords style?, Haki Right?, ''the only answer to just about anything dumb in this show, thats cool I get it.'' 
 
Sanji: is basically Brock from pokemon as he is just a generic character who tries to be a hit with the ladies and never gets any including that he is also a chef and STILL never gets ANY WOMAN or PUSSY. Poor bastard.    
 
Franky: I guess you can say he is the Cyborg technician of the ship who thinks he is SUPER MANLY but most of the time he is just a complete Super douche mentally and physically speaking. 
 
Nami: is Tragic navigator turned tragic Fan service. which gets dudes thirsting ''WHeres that nami Hentai at!!?? 
 
Chopper: I don't want to know any further about this annoying Doctor Yogi Bitch. 
 
Brook: Probably my favourite straw-hat pirate out of them all but Oda sometimes devalues his character like others. 
 
Nico Robin: is Tomb Raider but with a cool ability if I might add. 
 
And to be fair I liked the back stories of the characters. 
 
However, what I didn't like was over using the same sad theme for each of their themes with streams of over exaggerated tears. (talk about milking moments like these here to give people quickly them feels.)  
which gets old really fast. 
 
As for the sound department, its lacking but by no means bad, it suits whatever mood you could be feeling in this long ass snail pace of a series. the voice acting quality were few and not so many. 
 
Animation wise Can look really decent when they put there time into it like marineford for example and a lot of other times can look pretty abysmal most of the time according to Toei Animation. 
 
Overall am I enjoying this series? I am trying to, but because of those obvious glaring flaws on the surface still exist just like the treasure OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!!! 
 
I'll admit I have put this on hold during the arc of Doh Flippin Flamingo because I still intend to finish what I started. otherwise why go in over 600 episodes deep just to drop it? 
You see I'm a watcher not a reader of forever long mangas so I intend to keep it that way plus I have no time for comparisons between the anime and manga I have better stuff to do in my long life so I leave you with this. 
 
If you want the most silliest longest Shounen adventure ongoing where everything changes with the times except this then by all means give this a shot you might end up loving it, just not in the same way it has been for me.  
 
I can be sure I'm probably not the only one.

    Ask any person on the internet what their favourite kind of warrior is and you are bound to get one of these 2 answers. Ninja or Pirate. Now we ALL know Ninja\'s are a plenty in anime. But Pirates? Try finding a anime about that! 
 
Eiichiro Oda to the rescue! 
 
The legendary Pirate Gol D Roger. Once acquired everything a pirate could. But before he was executed he told people he hid his treasure \&quot;One Piece\&quot; at the end of the Grand Line. This started the great age of pirates! 
 
One Piece is set in the time of pirates. Even though there are references to real pirates. Bellamy, Alvida etc, its more of a fantasy world. And what a fantasy world it is! Weird creatures, giant monsters and people with a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; ability. Devil Fruit grants the person who eat it unique abilities such as transforming their body, or giving them special skills. The one consequence is it takes away their ability to swim. 
 
One of the people who ate a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; Is the young man Luffy. Blessed with the Gomu Gomu fruit (Rubber) He is a rubber man. and he wants to be the \&quot;Pirate King\&quot; (The person who acquires \&quot;One Piece\&quot;) He and his crew of weird but unique characters set of to the \&quot;Grand Line\&quot; to find One Piece. 
 
Eiichiro Oda created some really amazing characters! Rorona Zoro a swordsman who uses 3 swords. Liar Usopp, Navigator and Money maniac Nami, Chef and Love freak Sanji, Reindeer misfit Chopper and more. Even though the characters seem a little bland at first after a few episodes their characters really start to shine. 
 
Humour is a really big part of the series. You will constantly laugh your ass off at the weird and just downright funny humour this series has to offer. But its not all comedy. Heck no! Fans of action and drama will also love this series. the fights are simply incredible! with the Devil fruit users being the highlights of the series. But just like that the series can take a much darker turn. And will certainly manage to bring a tear to your eye. (Nami\'s background being one of those times DAMN YOU ARLONG!) 
But it never turns into a emo fest. 
 
Its a pretty long series (counting over 310 episodes) and even though there are some filler arcs. It just keeps getting better and better.

    I haven't written a review in almost a year so i might as well start with this 
 
80% of all user made reviews will be positive no matter what. The best way to evaluate anything is to read the negative reviews as well. This is a good rule to go by for anything (games, movies, appliances, etc) With that being said I'm not giving this series a 10.  
 
Quick Review: 
   - Story (4/10) Its an infinite loop story, shounen boy being the greatest in the world and it follows him in all his wacky adventures.  
   - Art (6/10) It is indeed a very well animated series but you can easily see many common ways to for the studio to cut corners.  
   - Sound (8/10) Voice acting is top notch, everyone has a wide range of emotions but some overreact too much in one episode. Whats with all the yelling? 
   - Characters (7/10) You'll either love em or hate them (or both) Regardless you''ll have your share of favorites and luckily you will know all about them.  
   - Enjoyment (8/10) Main story arcs are great but what grinds it to a halt are the long drawn out situations in the vein of the Dragon Ball series.  
 
 
 
Full Review: 
     I kept getting bugged and bugged about when i was going to pick this show up. Ever since 2004. Fast forward to 2008 and I finally picked up and started watching this show from episode 1. I started watching this show with very limited expectations since everyone keeps hyping the hell out of this show. And to be honest, the best way to watch this show is to have very low expectations. Because as soon as the story arc for obtaining Nami started (eps 031- 044), I definitely fell in love with this series.  
     That story ark had everything a shounen anime should have, comedy, drama, action, and serious business. Basically an edge of your seat roller coaster ride trying to figure out what will happen next. Sadly, the story arc's like this are far and few between. The structuring of most arc's usually focus on one or two of the main characters which is perfect for a long running series like this. Don't get me wrong, alot of the adventures are good clean fun which most will enjoy. It's fine if there's no continuity what so ever and plot holes you can fill a 10 gallon trash bag in. It's all about over the top slapstick adventures and it does that well, even perfectly.  
 
     So why in the hell did I give the story a score of 4? I could make a 10 page essay if I listed them all but the main issue is its whole premise. It is a LONG RUNNING shounen anime. That means they will do anything and everything to make a story arc as long as possible. A perfect example is that the opening AND closing credits will average between 90 to 150 seconds each, a last episode recap will last around 5 minutes , and a next week preview will last for about a minute. Add all that up and that roughly adds up to ~15 minutes of non essential story telling. FIFTEEN MINUTES!! Granted, new story arcs wont have as much time shaved off to start but the typical formula will repeat itself every time. But even then its like why bother watching last weeks episode if you can almost tell half of last weeks story today? Its an infinite loop that we're doomed to be in.  
     Since they are a long drawn out stories, they also suffer from the Dragon Ball virus. Having a face off between good guys and bad guys for 30+ episodes and essentially 'filling' in the time with flashbacks or side stories really insults the viewers intelligence in my opinion. They even have the gall to replay back story arcs that lasted upwards to 10 episodes and 'rehash' the arc into one or half an episode. I could have easily skipped over 260 episodes if i knew they were going to do that. I know it is to acclimate new young viewers to how their lovable characters came to be, but isnt that what dvd's are for? Or at the very least, don't bother to tie them in to a story arc.  
     One more thing I must mention, try not to think too hard when people look like they're going to die one minute and the next, they're up and jumping around like nothing happens or any inconsistencies like that. It will make your head explode if you do.  
 
If you are willing to forgive the aforementioned problems with this show (or any long running shounen anime) I'm sure you will notice they do carve alot of nice stories that you will more than likely enjoy. As the actual stories told in the series just look so much fun. It's like watching Indiana Jones NONSTOP. Although it will take forever for them to tell you a story, you'll either be laughing crying or enjoying the wackiness that is One Piece.   
 
The creator did do a wonderful job of making VERY unique and non static characters, although some might appear typical or cookie cutter, they usually do something completely opposite or you will discover things you never thought would happen (inconsistencies aside). On top of that, the voice actors are very memorable and fit their characters awfully well. Although most of them yell more than i would like, the sheer number of cast members is staggering and is hard for me not to be impressed. I agree I am not a fan of a few of the main characters but knowing so much about them (due to side stories) its hard not to cheer for the straw hat crew! 
 
This series is far from perfect, but it is very enjoyable.

    One Piece recounts the story of Monkey D Luffy, a young man who wishes to become the Pirate King; and the rest of the crew of the Mugiwara ('Straw Hat') Pirate crew, each of whom join the crew to realise lifelong dreams of their own. 
 
Luffy ate a Devil's Fruit as a child, more accurately the 'Gomu Gomu' fruit (gomu means 'rubber'), thus his body took on the form of rubber, enabling him to stretch and inflate himself at will - though the downside for anybody who eats a Devil's Fruit is that they can no longer swim: something of a disadvantage for a pirate. Luffy is a bit of of a unique character in all of the anime series I have watched: he's not smart, but he's not stupid. Perhaps 'simple' is the best way of describing him, as he has the same thoughts and ideals no matter what the situation is, sees no reason in pretending to be something he isn't, and often has trouble adjusting his fun-loving character to act appropriately in serious circumstances. Although he is the captain of the Mugiwara Pirates, he is pretty much held in line by the rest of his crew, especially Nami. He does, however, usually get the final word. 
 
Luffy's aim is to become Pirate King and to claim the ultimate treasure that the old and greatest Pirate King, Gol D Roger, announced at his execution was at the end of the Grand Line: the most dangerous, treacherous and feared ocean in the world. This treasure, 'One Piece', gives the series its name. It is yet unknown exactly what One Piece is, or what it does. However, with every island of the Grand Line that the crew traverse (the only way to sail the Grand Line being to hop from one island to the next) they are one stop closer to finding Gol D Roger's heritage. 
 
The rest of the Mugiwara Crew consists of characters just as well-rounded, though still retaining their individuality. Roronoa Zoro, a green-haired 3-sword-wielding (one in each hand, one in his mouth) bounty hunter who has come to be known as 'Pirate Hunter Zoro' (though the name was neither coined nor furthered by the man himself) joins the crew in order to realise his childhood dream of becoming the best swordsman in the world, figuring the Grand Line should bring him a plethora of worthy opponents. 
 
Nami, the navigator, is a beautiful yet intelligent orange-haired girl whose dream is to draw a map of the whole world - though her main passion is accumulating vast sums of money, usually via theft. She is generally the brains of the crew, but occasionally needs Luffy to show her that her heart is in the right place. 
 
Usopp, a long-nosed man whose penchant for stretching the truth is made evident in pretty much every episode, wishes to follow in his father's footsteps and become a great pirate. Although he's not as strong as other members of the crew and has no specific 'special powers', his quick-thinking and ingenious-yet-comedic inventions have too often been known to save the day. 
 
Sanji, self-professed 'Love Cook', is a talented chef from the floating restaurant Baratie, who can cook as well as he can kick - Sanji is generally characterised by his inability to resist stepping in to rescue a beautiful lady, especially Nami (even though she manipulates him simply because she knows she can). Sanji joined the crew after great persuasion in order to find All Blue, the legendary ocean where the four seas meet, and thus fish from all the seas can be found - a gourmet cook's paradise. 
 
Tony Tony Chopper is the ship's doctor. Here's where it starts getting a little, well, let's say idiosyncratic. Chopper is a reindeer (not a tanuki, a reindeer!) who ate the 'Hito Hito' Devil's Fruit (hito means 'man'), meaning that he is not only able to talk (to both humans and animals - a skill that comes in very useful), but also walk on his hind legs, and even transform himself from cute to somewhat monstrous forms. Chopper wants to become a great doctor and help people, and eventually, after much persuasion from Luffy, sees piracy as a way to give his wish meaning and direction. An ongoing joke with Chopper is for him to shout &quot;Doctor! We need a doctor!&quot; whenever anybody gets injured, before realising that he's the ship's doctor, and so gets to work. Chopper is a cutesy/comedy character but also gives us plenty of reasons to take him seriously. 
 
Finally we have Nico Robin, a woman with a mysterious past, and another with the power of a Devil's Fruit. Robin ate the 'Hana Hana' fruit (hana = 'flower'), and thus is able to grow hands from any surface - an ability which sounds pointless on paper but has saved the Mugiwaras from so much danger over the episodes that it has become almost integral to their survival. Robin is an archaeologist who joined the Mugiwaras at her own behest, as Luffy had saved her life against her will. She spends most of her time reading history books, and someday dreams of finding the 'one true history' of their world by traversing the Grand Line in search of 'lodestones', which have ancient documents inscribed on them. 
 
Even at the early stage of introducing Luffy and watching him recruit the first few crewmates, I had fallen in love with this anime series. The first 20 or so episodes are somewhat slow-paced, as well as a little confusing, as the quirky sense of humour that One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda gives the series takes a little getting used to for a gaijin. The other members of the crew don't want to join Luffy's outfit immediately, but Luffy manages to convince them that becoming a pirate with him is the best way to realise their dreams, and also helps them to tie up loose ends in their homeland before setting off under the straw hat-wearing Jolly Roger. 
 
It's important to bear in mind that these are not your classic Western, rum-toting, eye patch-wearing, &quot;YAAAAAARRRRR&quot;-shouting pirates, with huge beards, peg legs and hooks for hands. That isn't to say there aren't characters who fall under these categories (except for the &quot;YAAAAARRRR&quot;ing), but One Piece is a world filled with intensely interesting, larger-than-life characters who bring a dimension to the anime you wouldn't have thought possible. The powers of the various enemies of the Mugiwara crew bring an almost rock-paper-scissors element to the show, as the party is often split up into groups who have to survive and meet back up with the others in order to continue their journey, some characters' expertises being more useful against certain enemies than others - although the rubberman never knows when to accept defeat! 
 
This anime contains some of the most imaginative and out-of-this-world story arcs I've ever come across in an anime series, especially one that does not take itself too seriously. One arc sees the Mugiwaras sail up into the sky to 'Skypeia', or Sky Island, where they take on an evil God who has the power of lightning. The final 'showdown' battles can span 10 or more episodes and are, for want of a better word, epic. Simply the journey undertaken to get onto the Grand Line itself is a tale worth rewatching for its many highlights, as well as being an introduction that comforts you by subtly indicating that the future escapades of the Mugiwara crew will pique your interests further. 
 
The Mugiwaras are to a point misunderstood as pirates - they don't plunder, rape or murder everybody they meet. In most cases, they actually help those they come across, but are still very much wanted by the Marines (the main governing body of the sea), who set huge bounties for Luffy and Zoro in order to garner help from bounty hunters, as well as the many other pirate factions sailing around. 
 
The animation sometimes lets the show down slightly - it seems the budget for the animators seems to rise and fall depending on the importance of the arc. Some battles are brilliantly animated, such as the showdown between Luffy and Crocodile, leader of the Shichibukai, but many of the filler arcs look poor in comparison. However, this does not take anything away from the fact that One Piece is a masterpiece, with a quirky Japanese sense of humour and a narrative that can be appreciated by all, but loved only by some. My advice is to give it a try - if you're anything like me it will certainly captivate your interest, and then some. 
 
Quick warning: stay WELL away from the 4KIDS English dub. They gutted the show, stripping it of many of its best features, and hired a voice cast that could test the sanity of anybody, be you 3 or 43. The lush orchestral musical score and lively J-pop intro has been replaced by awful faux hip-hop in order to market it to Americans, some of the blood is cut while some remains (this is NOT a gory anime by any stretch of the imagination - blood is used as more of an indicator that a fight has been going on a while), characters are renamed according to whim (Zoro is renamed Zolo, either to escape copyright infringement, give a closer transliteration from katakana, or just as an effort to be utterly, utterly lame), and there are some frankly ridiculous amendments - the one that really sticks out for me is Sanji's cigarette. Sanji likes to smoke, and he always has a cigarette hanging from the side of his mouth. In the 4KIDS dub, this cigarette is replaced - in every frame - with a lollipop.

    One Piece has been running for 15 years now and shows zero signs of slowing down. It is true that there are several anime and manga series that have run for MUCH longer, but that doesn't honestly excuse One Piece for how long it has overstayed it's welcome! One Piece has a diehard fandom and it is by far the highest in average rating out of the big 4 shonens. However, it is actually my LEAST favorite of the big 4. I'm dead serious, I really don't like One Piece and I will explain why. 
 
One Piece reminds me of a line from one of my favorite movies: Shaun of the Dead. Shaun: ""I like having him around, I've known him since primary school, and besides he's a laugh! Pete: ""Ok, I admit on rare occasion he can be funny. Remember when he was up all night drunk playing Tekken 2?"" Shaun: ""Oh yeah (laughs) when was that?"" Pete: ""That was 10 years ago! When the FUCK is he going home!?"" 
 
While other shonen series at least try to mature along with their fanbase like Naruto going to Naruto Shipuuden or Dragonball going to DBZ, One Piece is the same goofy, juvenile crap that it was in 1999, right down to the eye raping HORRIBLE art. Another problem is that it tells a continuous story, which makes it difficult for new fans to get into it or get caught up without spending 5 straight months doing nothing but watching One Piece! Pokemon has an excuse for running forever and never evolving (get it?) because new games come out and each season Ash must move to a new region and catch more Pokemon. Most people don't continue to watch Pokemon, so it is constantly getting new fans that are experiencing Pokemon for the first time. Pokemon (insert edition here) is their first Pokemon game and the anime seems fresh and new to them. They haven't seen the original Pokemon series or played the original games and it doesn't matter! Detective Conan has been running for 20 years, but like the Sherlock Holmes short stories it took inspiration from, it is completely episodic with a new mystery each week and only a few established characters. A new audience can jump in anytime and it doesn't matter if you've seen the first 15 seasons. One Piece actually tries to tell a continuous story where it DOES matter what happened in the first 10 seasons. You can't just jump in at episode 600 and expect to really enjoy it and understand it. However, even you get all caught up with the 800 episodes of the Straw Hat Crew, it isn't worth it because the tone, characters, and quality of story telling never matures into anything that someone 16 and up and having half a brain would find amusing! 
 
All of this isn't to say that One Piece is a particularly bad anime. I have seen some REALLY bad anime, but One Piece isn't on my list of anime I actually hate. One Piece is an anime that I consider mediocre, insanely overrated, and having run WAY past its time without having the grace or decency to take a bow. It is much like the Simpsons in that last regard. At least one good thing came out of One Piece....None Piece! If you haven't seen One Piece yet, I would recommend skipping this one, but still check out None Piece on Youtube, because it's awesome!

    Lets start with the story.  
 
Story. 2/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. 
 
Art. 3/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. 
 
Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. 
 
Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. 
 
Enjoyment. 5/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... 
 
overall this series is mostly full of gag you should not take it seriously if you do you're only going to be disappointed so the series isn't the worst series I've ever watch. So if you want a series to laugh at, I would 100% recommend one piece to you all.

    Well my first review, Ill try and make it a good one.  
 
One Piece, well i gotta be honest, I didn't like it at first. I thought that the voices were stupid and that it had really no plot whatsoever. This is all thanks to 4kids making the crappiest dub ever. I stopped watching it after, ep 20 or so, but then i heard to try it again using subs. I thought nah, it might sounds really stupid, but i still tried. After episode 20 or so, I was like &quot;WOW&quot;, this is awesome and from then on i was watching it non stop until episode 280 where i caught up. (yea i watched about 250+ episodes non stop) :D If you plan on watching it, watch it subbed please.  Well that's enough of that. Onwards. 
 
Story 
The story is really amazing.  At first i didn't find anything entertaining, but I pressed on and continued watching. The plot is really amazing.  Its different from what most mangaka does, and that is power.  The story is all about achieving your dreams, getting nakama(companions/friends), and overall having a grand adventure. The story is original in a sense that it gives you a feeling of ease and hilarity when reading it. I for one, have always enjoyed a chapter and in each chapter is very powerful and/or funny.  
 
Art 
Well to be honest, I find the art interesting.  I mean its cool at times but then in some episodes its really crappy.  Thats probably the only thing I dont like.  But the fight scenes are amazing. The character design is very interesting and very original. The animation is pretty...crappy at times but that's to be expected in some animes. I mean not all of them would be amazing but there are quite a few that really have good animation. The animation for most fight scenes are really well drawn and intricate. 
 
Sound 
I have only one thought for this. JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS OWN AMERICAN VOICE ACTORS. Seriously, they sound so much better and once you hear them, your instantly hooked to them.  4kids really did the crappiest dubbing ever, and that was mainly why i stopped watching it. Also their gum gum rap( american opening) was so terrible. Thanks to Funimation for at least making an &quot;ok&quot; dub. But subs are still the best. Their voices mesh with the characters personality so much that it's amazing. 
 
Character 
Wow. The characters are really amazing. From the air-head captain to the greedy, money-loving navigator, it really is the most unique anime ever.  They are all different characters with all different dreams that power them throughout the show.  They all have alot in common, but really the biggest thing they have in common is that they all believe and support their captain, because he has saved them where they needed it the most.  Every character in One Piece is different from everyone and they are all entertaining. Every episode is funny and most of the time it is Luffy that makes it funny. Luffy is pretty much the most unique character made.  He is a simple minded captain who has no other thought other than one piece, his nakama, and MEAT. Yes meat, he loves meat,  but if you watch it you will learn that :p 
 
Enjoyment 
Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The fillers are much better than Naruto or Bleach fillers and they are alot more exciting.  Again the fight scences are amazing.  Every episode you will definitely laugh, because Oda-sensei (the mangaka- the one who made One Piece) is awesome.  He is pretty much the most creative mangaka, and the person i definitely want to meet.   
 
Overall 
Overall, I give One Piece a 10/10, well because it is pretty much amazing. The characters are very loveable, especially Luffy.  Every episode i laughed, every episode I was always at the edge of my seat.  If people tell you that One Piece sucks or that its not all that great, then don't listen! The only bad thing about One Piece is that 4kids made the dub first and then ruined it in America, don't listen and just watch it.  Listen to me and not them okay :D

    Review In short,  
I'm Going to keep it real with you all that you would obviously see my score that i gave One Piece.  
Well, That is why in my review I'm going to go over these factors as to why this isn't worth your time so that I can save you a life line. So for that You are welcome. (This Applies To Manga Also in case your wandering) 
 
Anyway I have Dropped this series for many reasons alone that I did to where I was watching and Investing my time with this and its pretty simple why that is and why It made sense for me to review One Piece.  
 
Firstly Its very easy to base this series on the analogy of this being a shonen adventure series yes, however what continues to irk at my own viewing experience of watching this for a long while now and to put it simply if I were to sum up this series in a nutshell It would be summed up in 4 words...(Typical Forced Annoying Tendencies)   
 
To empathize my point much further,  
This anime has dragged onto the point where I know longer care where the story is heading now because its writer  
Oda Eiichiro unfortunately likes to Time waste WAY too often in his  
writing of milking hundreds of episodes of this series of its so called world building and brain wash a lot of its Japanese audience as well as those that following the whole over saturated popular shonen trend in the process to the point that the fans themselves have overate this anime in general in its own category. 
 
Literally the story has not changed to any degree where a new plot can be implemented differently in its approach which sadly isn't the case let alone can the story mature with its premise as this is still following the same freaking formula of a repetitive lame shonen nonsense of its character troupes with most of its episodes from 1 to god knows what episode its currently on right now so far which I really question if this anime just wants the viewers attention just because of its length that can still be milked because of it?  
 
OR does it want to be a pirate adventure shonen that can integrate an effort into its story and characterizations? Well at this point I can easily tell you that both completely Suck at making these traits realized in Oda's craft which is not engaging my viewing of the same formula with many random added coincidences that luffy and strawhats encounter on their journey and with that has lost more credibility in claiming that this is an anime about pirates in general which is even more ridiculous throughout and for the longest time after a while I just found this series to be rather boring and predictable in its long tedious dragged out boring narrative.  
(Btw, Nothing to do with just its length or its terrible look in general) 
 
I honestly got to ask those currently watching or even reading One piece  
Do you really like to enjoy the same old tropes and jokes over and over again that includes many long pointless plot elements that have many cons for milking their story and character for its own purpose?? 
 
Its Just like how the Naruto franchise lost credibility thinking its own series depicts ninjas in its own way to show the struggle taking place for nonjas old and young in its own viewing in the show which shows in both naruto and one piece over time what it has lost through its extended transition in both their writing of these concepts. 
 
As a shonen anime Its these glaring flaws that just keeps continuing on and on. That in terms of its story, characterization, progression, writing, enjoyment and any replay value what so ever for a shonen experience which becomes blatantly obvious that it fails! especially when some claim this to be the definitive shonen anime experience of a grand adventure. (Oh Dear.) 
 
There are 2 clear things fans will use to defend this show by saying don't be put off by the shows length or its dumb cartoony animation and secondly dont be put off with the handling of the material in the way Toei Animation handles this so instead read the manga, And to that I say.. NONSENSE! Since the show already has a lot problems already that fans seem to gloss over. 
 
You see, Reading its Guinness book of its trash manga doesn't even help or even give me value for reading through for what has loads of the same problems as I've mentioned above. 
 
If that wasn't enough of an issue. Its story of its characters and its events always end up feeling pretty much the same Forced Melodramatic story in its writing that you have seen and heard loads of times and only forces you to endure this along with bad side stories that contribute into an even SLOWER pace for this show in each of its build up with each Arc that by over hundreds and hundreds of episodes later by then it totally becomes unacceptable, By then I don't blame certain people out there for skipping chunks of its story now and then.  
(Trust me, Having tolerance for this anime should be the least of your worries here people.) 
 
For me going through each arc to arc in a easy going manner that I approach most anime through my viewing You'd expect that this would be casual thing of ease for me right? No sweat? WRONG,  
It didn't guarantee me as a viewer any love or charm what so ever to a lot of its characters like the time you are first introduce to them in the series. 
 
Instead it only just copies and paste stuff mostly of the same scenarios that you would see far too often in this series for most if not all of these characters and YES that does includes the main crew along with their progression except for some few in the straw hat crew that show to get more abilities than others really makes it fair in its togetherness doesn't it?  
(Some bonding that is if you ask me?, since only a few certain characters with plot armour that can do certain things most others couldn't do)  
 
Even when uniting the straw hats together only just makes it for a more cheesier affair most of the time when you would obviously expect it Especially when it comes off as cliche as it does.  
 
Which also regards to parts where one piece at some parts wants to go dark its already so desperate to up the ante that a blind Ray Charles can easily tell from miles away that its only going to result into a similar conclusion like before. 
 
I mean come on! its way past most of the amount of standard shonen episodes! which reminds me of Detective Conan, However in Conan's case the Difference is between these 2 series is in its Fandoms.  
One Piece fans try to Over hype the crap out of this which is really unnecessary even when lots of people know clearly that it is the case.  
 
A terrible excuse for making points along this series own progression just because its stretched out as it has been for the premise inexcusably which is a joke for those who try to justify this notion.  
 
Look, We already got the basic gist of things going on in this series from the beginning, Even through its dumb world building and set up and even till now is still not even well structured since it throws random places for us to be distracted so that fillers can help maintain its bad pace let alone does it even make that much sense to begin with especially when trying to use foreshadowing to justify the ridiculous amount of episodes that is in this series as it is to make us feel like we have feel invested in the unknown mysteries of the show which actually does the opposite effect.  
 
I believe the one piece fandom have gotten mixed up with what world building actually is with the amount of episodes there have been especially focusing on stuff that this show thinks I should see but I don't and no I don't need to have to skip arcs just to enjoy something, Why should I? that is just retarded. Is that why its Manga counterpart is in the Guinness book of records because of its pacing and complacency? Makes sense for whatever parts of this series gains popularity in much of its story for being pointlessly repetitive i suppose. 
 
1. First off regarding what I've mentioned so far,  
If you have an immersive world and there is already enough content in the story/journey in your world building never mind how vast or mysterious it is, Don't pointlessly drag it out instead USE IT! and stop milking it with stupid character expressions of coincidences full of plot devices and plot armour, I do not care that it is a dumb shonen. At least FMA knew this a lot better. 
 
2. Pointless prologues to your episodes.  
 
3. Bad morals in many different situations of the story with its writing. 
 
4. Stupid journey objectives that hardly revolves around the plot of the treasure of one piece until HUNDREDS AND I MEAN HUNDREDS of episodes later on to the point which is unacceptable along with milking its main characters most of the time of this franchise that gets to the point where it feels like its turning into filler which by the way there are a lot of them no matter what fans try to say against this. 
 
5. Dumb fanservice depictions of its females making video games like dead or alive and Onechanbara look a lot more tolerable. 
 
6. Stop foreshadowing something in the story that was mentioned hundreds and hundreds of episodes ago as its not good story telling neither is it clever in any way since it never justifies its consistency for constantly dragging on in the way it does. 
 
7. Over hyping stronger characters that don't really get involve in the story that much anyway. 
 
8. Its lame music score that should sound great but it doesn't. 
 
9. Most of the times bad animation no doubt, AKA Toei Animation VERY LAZY INDEED and are swimming in pools of Yen around them like fat sewer Rats.  
 
10. Devil fruits abilities in the way with any other devil fruits that are demonstrated looks stupid and nonsensical to the overall balance and power scaling with variations of different class devil fruit users, which in term of supposedly creating unpredictability and uniqueness to a devil fruit user's abilities only serves to unfortunately create a convoluted mess of an explanation of devil fruit powers in general to those that are Logia, Paramecia and Zoan in their own element even in terms of their weakness which is badly depicted on in the show. 
 
11. Haki creates a lot of bullcrap deus ex machinas later on as an excuse of not explaining a lot about devil fruits all that well and lots of times is used mainly for plot armour for certain characters of the writer's choice which is lazy nor does it add anything new to the battle scaling in fights more like unneeded add ons. 
 
12. its voice acting well its just mostly tedious and over the place nothing great or over the top despite how Oda writes the story (Bad writing Btw) that even after listening to lot of these characters it just makes me want to listen to a dying mule instead. Nothing weird or wonderful about that my friends. 
 
With all that being said, Its only qualities that I like about one piece are the art designs of certain characters and the fact there is a series that stars pirates, since there are very few anime series that have pirates (not that they are suppose to be role models in any way)  
but those are the only positives with this series in general for me and honestly nothing more. 
 
Overall its an over exaggerated series of repetitive outcomes that I have not enjoyed in its long run about dumb wannabe pirates quote PIRATES! It's only real positive here is HEY ITS ABOUT PIRATES WOW THATS RARE TO FIND IN ANIME ISN'T IT???..WRONG BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT PIRATES ARE LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHO CARES ANYWAYS.  
 
That is like me wanting to write a story about slavery on different Ethnicity/Races but NOOOOOOO............. that won't be right, so why not glorify slave traders into being these nice dumb heroes? because you know It sounds interesting right? RIGHT??... WELL WRONG AGAIN. 
 
Now going back to my point of Watching this crappy cartoon this only makes me or most viewers seem to have to glorify such a pathetic outlook of a premise with its stretched out world building that is not even incisive enough to its history of the story, neither is it memorable for me enough to even care about it to watch it any longer as it doesn't reward me growth in their characters, a decisive objective or consistency of its so called journey within its story in general.  
 
Last but not least The fights really suck! seriously do yourselves a Big favour there are better Shonens and many other Animes out there that is worth watching that has better characters, better story, better pacing and better growth than this long turd of a show that seems to overate a lot in Japan above others which unfortunately is the world we live in today. Consider this dropped and good riddance.  
 
Excuse me for being honestly critical as I am as I do not sugar coat a series if that is what you really wanted about this show in general, well too bad. You can go to other reviewers that are giving out tens towards this Overrated piece of fiction that's overstayed it's welcome. 
 
To all of you who have read my review thanks for taking the time and take care.

    In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review's goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series. 
 
And by the way, this review is based upon the original Japanese version. If you have had the bad luck of viewing the 4Kids dubbed version, you have my heartfelt condolences. Right, well, anyway, moving on... 
 
PLOT: The story of One Piece mostly consists of the Straw Hat Pirates traveling from island to island and having crazy adventures. Although each crewmember has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: to reach the end of the treacherous Grand Line. Bound by this promise, they pass through unbelievable adventures. Given this pattern, you would think the plot would get boring and predictable, right? Amazingly enough, unlike shonen anime with similar plot devices, One Piece manages to become less and less predictable as its plot advances. As it advances, it also delves into serious situations. There is actually much tragedy involved with One Piece, but the show maintains a balance of comic relief as well. I've actually been driven to tears many times while watching this show, but I've laughed out loud just as many times, if not more. 
 
ART: One Piece's art style is one of the elements that turns many people off to the series. The style is fairly old-school, remniscent of 90's shows like Dragonball Z. Then again, I guess One Piece started out in the late 90's, too, so that's to be expected. Either way, the quality of the animation steadily improves as the show moves along. The show is now broadcast in HD, and the quality simply blows me away with every new episode. But the show's animation style remains the same, just greatly improved in terms of quality. After all, with a show as crazy as One Piece, modern animation styles just wouldn't fit. I simply cannot imagine Monkey D. Luffy with eyes like Uzumaki Naruto; it simply does not work. 
 
SOUND: I absolutely adore the music of One Piece. There are so many different kinds of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, angry, confused, funny, sleepy, scared, epic, cryptic, foreboding, intense, etcetera, etcetera. For each of these situations, there is a unique musical piece which plays in the background. What's more is that each character has their own style of music and their own theme. Whenever I hear a background song, I immediately know what's going on, and fall into the according state of mind. It happens subconsciously, and it adds to both the predictability and spontaneity of the show. If Zoro's 'epic' music begins to play, he may still lose his current battle. However, whenever I hear that music, I immediately know, ""Zoro is going to dominate in this scene,"" regardless of whether or not he actually does. 
 
CHARACTERS: I cannot think of enough synonyms for ""incredible"" to sufficiently describe One Piece's character development, so I'll just say that it's definitely SUPER!!! Ahahaha...yeah, that was a reference to the show...anyway, the characters of One Piece are one of its major selling points. In fact, it was the characters, not the story, that hooked me to this show. Each character has their own personal reason for sailing the Grand Line and for joining the Straw Hat Pirates, and this goal pushes them to new heights with each passing adventure. This goal is backed by an emotionally engrossing backstory which usually can encompass more than two episodes. I have been moved to tears by so many touching flashbacks I no longer possess enough fingers to count them all. The characters are all very personable as well, and are the one aspect of One Piece you can nearly always predict. You always know Luffy will be Luffy, and Usopp will be Usopp. Never would you expect Sanji to suddenly lash out at Nami, but you would certainly expect Nami to lash out at everyone else. Do not misunderstand me; I am not implying that the characters of One Piece are static. They are all decidedly not static. By comparing the current Luffy with the Luffy of the first few episodes, you can discern an obvious difference. The same holds true for all of the crewmembers. Yet the changes take place gradually over time, not all at once. That is my favorite part of this anime. Just like actual humans, the One Piece characters develop new traits and discard old traits, but always remain the same person they were when first introduced. 
 
ENJOYMENT: When trying to convince my friends that they should watch One Piece (mostly so I can discuss the latest episodes with them), I inevitably have to ask myself why I personally enjoy the series. And then I am stumped. I mean, I could say all the above and people still wouldn't be satisfied. There would be people asking, ""Well, why do you like that kind of plot? I saw this one show that had a different kind and I liked it."" How am I supposed to respond to that!? That's the equivalent of saying, ""Why do you like chocolate ice cream? I like vanilla, and it's way better."" Whether you enjoy something or not all depends on how your brain is wired and your attitude when you try it. Just because I love One Piece doesn't mean you will, and just because someone hates One Piece doesn't mean I have to. Erm...I kind of got on a rant. Ehehehe...uh, yeah. So, I enjoy One Piece because of the above reasons. Is...that all I'm supposed to put here? It seems inadequate for some reason... 
 
OVERALL: In conclusion, I find One Piece to be epic! Whether you do or don't, please don't discount it for any reason until you've actually begun watching it. While I can attest to the fact that the story doesn't really become exciting until the crew reaches the Grand Line, the material before that is still crucial to the rest of the story, and is still very enjoyable. Oh, and as a matter of precaution, DO NOT WATCH THE 4KIDS DUB! If you do, then you may very well suffer severe damage to your cerebral cortex. If you must watch the show in English, I recommend the FUNimation dub. Their DVDs contain about 13 episodes each, and are available wherever you buy your anime. I forget how much they cost...well, you can Google it if you really want to.

    *Contains major spoilers* 
 
Well I'm about to do what most people consider suicide... Talk bad about One Piece... 
 
Following: Full-fledged review and chibi review-version at the end for those who can't read: 
 
FULL REVIEW: 
 
To be clear about this: I have seen all movies and all the episodes released until now (ep 658) and while there are tons of things I'd like to talk about, one thing stands above all: One Piece never grew up like other shounen did. Naruto, Bleach, Dragonball and even Fairy Tail have become more mature and improved themselves over the passage of time. One Piece is still the same non-serious, immature nonsense that first aired in 1999. 
 
Well to begin with One Piece's famous strongest point, the story... I am just not impressed. Ignoring the fact that after 600 episodes the anime's new arc revolves around talking toys and chibi fairies (childish as hell), most of One Piece's arcs are practically the same. Straw Hats arrive at said island, where a tragedy has been happening despite the place appearing bright on the outside, the whole tragedy originates from 1 man who is usually evil for the most pitiful of reasons, straw hats get seperated into 3-4 groups, straw hats kick villain ass, a big feast is thrown in by the glad citizens where another arc is foreshadowed before they move on to the next island. And while people will argue that the ""War of the Best""arc was different, I still didn't find it the least bit interesting (2 deaths only? really?). 
 
Staying on the story part, lets talk about what's arguably the most important story element in a shounen: The villain. One Piece has yet to show us a villain whose appearance isn't laughable. Crocodile was wearing a coat in the middle of the dessert, Enel's ears were too long not to notice, blackbeard is missing way too many teeth to be taken seriously, Donflamingo... I can't even begin to name the things that make him not-even-slightly threatening. In general One Piece follows the brilliant rule that ""evil is stupid"" and the protagonist's charge-ahead thoughtless moves always prevail against the plans the villains had been setting for a few good decades now. Going for villains' backstories, it's usually brilliant writing such as: Stupid for the Yolo, big misunderstanding in the past, pity jealousy and ""we will explain it some time in the future"". Sorry, its just hard to take these guys seriously. 
 
Still on the story part: Being so kid-friendly is annoying. I can't get over how War of the Best, the ""grand battle"" of One Piece only had 2 victims, or how the Colosseum in the Dressrosa arc had no casualties whatsoever in a ""battle to the death"". Oda grow some balls and KILL people. Also regarding Ace's death in the War of the Best... I am not amused by how all of One Piece fans claim it as the most tragic thing to ever happen and yet we knew nothing about Ace other than the flashbacks. You could just as easily have put a Nazi Officer in his place and I'm sure the fanbase would still be crying buckets if we saw a flashback of said officer playing with the snow as a child while some uninspired dramatic music was playing. I can't decide if I'm more annoyed by the awful writing or how moronic the fanbase is. 
 
Humor & Fanservice: Waaaaaay too repetitive. It was funny in the first 100 episodes, now I just want to chocke puppies every time Brook makes a skeleton joke or Luffy and Chopper get overly excited about something. On the fanservice + story part: There is no female lead. Nami and Robin became important characters for their respective arcs (Arlong + CP9) but right after that they slipped in the background and became minor characters. Still on the Fanservice part: Oh yeah, sex, flirting and even love don't exist in this universe. Everyone trying to take part in one of those is either a villain-in-disguise or someone about to be tricked because of their stupidity. In general: For One Piece Sex/flirt/love is stupid (right next to ""evil is stupid""). 
 
Sound Part: 1st: The variety is a total disappointment. I can't remember a single track that actually got me on the edge of my sit. 2nd: The animators don't even make proper use of the soundtracks that already are avaliable to them. For example remember the final fight Luffy had against Crocodile. Do you remember the epic music? Obviously no because some moron decided that the fight shouldn't have music at all. Now imagine if at the same scene (final moments before Crocodile's defeat) One Piece's original opening ""we are"" was added. Suddenly the scene becomes 100% more exciting. They already had the copyrights, it's not like adding it would hurt anyone! The sound effects are equally terrible. Just look at the brilliant sound effect of Sanji repeatedly kicking Don Flamingo in ep 655... Sorry but I have made RPG Maker games with better sound effects than this. On the voice acting part: MOTHER OF ALL ATTROCITIES, IT'S HORRIBLE. Just look at the age of the voice actors, half of them are about to die (and I'm crossing my fingers). The voices are completely unfitting for most of the cast, not sounding at all like the age they're supposed to portray (well that's a big surprise...). Of course screams of despair, crying etc etc don't sound even relatively convincing. 
 
Animation: Just awful. Way below the antagonism. The only worse animation example I can provide in a relatively similar episode release period was the ""fast-paced-action"" in the Naruto Vs Pain battle, and that was an artistic mistake on the studio's part that was never again repeated for exactly that reason. I won't even go into detail describing how lazy the studio is, using the same footage OVER AND OVER AND OVER. 
 
Action: Doesn't really exist. One Piece doesn't ever show a proper fight without something goofy (aka annoying morons making even more annoying jokes) breaking up the seriousness. When the anime does decide to get serious it's just Luffy screaming on top of his lungs cliche lines while the villain doesn't even bother debating and just tries to kill Luffy (not that I blame them). The fights mostly consist of 10 seconds of action being repeatedly shown with slightly different soundtracks playing on the background each time and villain lengthy monologues inbetween them, usually followed by concentration-breaking flashbacks of things we have already seen a million times. If you're hoping for creative fast-paced excitement look elsewhere. 
 
One Piece is like a kid that never grew up. After 600 episodes, despite all the ""hardshps"" our protagonist came through, he never really matured, none of the characters did. The tone of the anime didn't mature either. a graphics improvement and a gradual increase of the cast members being the only notable changes since the beginning of the anime and for me it has just become too monotonous, too boring. Once Piece is waaay past its due, but there is a single reason it stays alive. Nostalgia. People are willing to overlook all of its flows simply because it serves as a bridge for times when things were simpler for them (or so they remember at least). But if someone was to judge One Piece for what it really is and not for the happy memories of being taken by daddy to the Luna Park he would see it for what it is: Trash. 
 
CHIBI REVIEW VERSION: 
Aweful animation and soundtrack, followed a story that quite clearly follows a pattern even for its jokes, overly repetitive and with action that doesn't really remind of action. Immature, with annoying characters that are portrayed as ""smart"" rather than ""morons"" and laughable villains. Stay away.

    Warning: Minor Spoilers 
  
If I were to say anything bad (and I will have to do that as this review is not a positive one) about this anime that would not offend the hardcore fans (and I know there are a lot) is that it's PAINFULLY slow. 
 
 Even if you leave the fillers aside, still- the plot itself progresses in such a slow pace that it's rather hard to watch. Now for a younger audience it may not matter that much, but to me as a higher age audience, it matters greatly, after all, out of the 23~ minutes of each episode 3 are spent on opening and ending (which is usual I guess), but in most episodes, roughly 5 (!) or more minutes are spent on a recap of the current story arc, as if the creators of the show forgot it's a shounen anime and instead got the idea that the audience are elderly people with Alzheimer. 
 
 But ok, this means there is still 15 minutes left per episode right? Well, not really. In most episodes, the heroes get separated. When they do, the anime tries to keep track of ALL of them simultaneously, cutting every few minutes. This wouldn't be so bad IF after the cut, the same exact scene did not repeat itself (example - a few seconds that show one of the main heroes standing and looking at a place/ villain that is shown from a few angles. Then the anime continues elsewhere, and when it comes back to the same place, the same exact scene is shown). That may not sound as much, but in drastic cases that can sum up to a few minutes (the worst case I bothered to count was almost 4 minutes of time wasted on watching the same scene). Combined with a lot of other tricks, I'd say that a lot of episodes are left with about 11 minutes of actual content on average. That is simply dreadful. 
 
 Now to say some positive things for contrast- the story is actually very interesting and the characters are well done... BUT, no matter how good something is, if you drag it out too much (and this is indeed the case with One Piece), even the best story in the world and the best characters possible (not to say one piece has neither of those.. The story is great, and the characters are good, but not more) will not keep you entertained, and turn even the best story possible into a boring experience.  
 
Now back to the negatives. NO ONE DIES IN THIS ANIME. This is of course an exaggeration, as some people actually do die in this anime BUT only when it's critical to the plot. At all the other times, the characters ""die"" just to add drama and to come back a few scenes later.. Sometimes to ""die"" again and add even more ""drama"" (added """" because at this point its more awkward/silly after one time rather than dramatic). The worst case of this I saw was with Brownbeard who ""died"" something like 5 times over 2-3 episodes (if I remember right), and still stayed alive in the end while the show tried to suck as much drama out of this as possible. And this brings me to the next point- fake drama. They seem to try and squeeze out as much of it as possible, at every opportunity they get. From crying children (and adults) to characters repeatedly ""dying"" and to the most cliche tearjerkers possible at every turn of the story. They even go as far as to try and make the villain's henchmen AND EVEN THE VILLAIN himself have a tragic past that you are supposed to relate to and feel sorry for (because seems a villain can't just be evil because that is just the way he is, he had to become evil because something bad happened (lol)). Also I mentioned crying.. There is an unbelievable amount of it in this anime. And that would be ok (I guess) if  
A- they did not try to milk it for drama (yep, that's a word that sure gets a lot of use when discussing this anime huh?) every single time 
B- they didn't think that when someone cries, he instantly turns ugly, with snot running down his nose and with the worst face expression possible, regardless of gender,  age or how emotional he is. 
 
I'd say a lot more, but there is already a lot of text, and it's enough to sum it up - this anime is not one I would recommend someone to watch under any normal circumstances (maybe only if someone made a shortened version with all the repeats, openings, endings and cuts removed thus making the whole anime be at around 300 episodes max), I watched over 600 episodes myself, and I can safely say that although some parts were enjoyable, it was mostly rather boring when looked as a whole, and I am regretting the time I spent watching it (as of what i watched it so long- my friend recommended it to me and I did not expect it to last this long. I usually finish what I start, but this is ridiculous.)

    One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched. 
But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we? 
 
A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age.  
 
In the world of One Piece, there is such a thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water. 
 
And where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
Now how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple. 
 
One Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be.  
 
One Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together. 
 
Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable. 
 
In contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does. 
 
Another potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is. 
 
Do not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit. 
 
In short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen. 
 
Regardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.

    There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show.  ""I don't like the art style"" or ""I've seen the dub - NO THANKS.""  I'm guilty of both of these myself.  But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece.  For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is.  If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh.  They butchered it, there's really no other way to put it.  They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series.  FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go. 
 
As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen.  Much more ""cartoonish"" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime.  Despite that, you end up loving it.  I wouldn't even say that you have to ""get used to it"" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way.  It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before.  Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have.  Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at. 
 
Now that we've got those two points out of the way... 
 
One Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise.  The plot is pretty basic at first.  Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him.  You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them.  They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities.  They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams.  Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew.  Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason.  Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series.  No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses. 
 
The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE.  Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch.  The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC.  But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge.  The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few.  There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor. 
 
One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise!   There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things.  I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point.  One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments.  And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA. 
 
In a word, One Piece is perfect.  And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say?  It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end.  It is, simply put, amazing. 
 
So why should you watch One Piece? 
 
Because you're missing out on one hell of a fantastic show if you don't at least give it a try.

    To start off, I had seen quite a few episodes of one piece as a child on toonami, prior to even discovering what anime was in fact. From the very beginning I had adored this show, even watching the horrendous dubs on american television.  
 
To speak of the dubs, do not judge one piece by these. PLEASE. For God's sake don't hate one piece or anything about it because of what 4kids decided to do to it. Simply put they took something of masterpiece and full of depth into a shallow, horrid voice acting, and choppy version of the original. Funimation has done quite a decent job of recreating the dubbed version, but nothing can compete with the original, as the original is what it was meant to be like.  
 
Also, do not dismiss this lovely anime because of the earlier animation style of the first few episodes (as well as the more cartoony based style.) To dismiss something because of the artwork is no good reason to not watch it. THe characters are so unique and so original, and each character has meaning. Oda (the author) goes into complete detail with each of his characters. Even creating the characters in all of the filler episodes.  
 
What I can say about the story is that I have never laughed harder, sobbed more intensely, or fangirled more viciously than in this anime. The pure plot of this anime is so in depth and so intricate that I have re watched it several times (yes, all 554 episodes) So many people I come in contact with ask me ""How in the WORLD do you watch something so long? I just can't start now it's too overwhelming."" Well, let me tell you. I got so into this I was watching about 20-30 episodes daily. Just from the fact that I couldn't get enough of this anime. I really couldn't. 
 
It's starts off as a regular kind of pirate scenario where everyone wants to become the best. What really caught me is the fact that it takes every type of pirate ""legend"" or mystery and puts it into a reality. Sea monsters, crazy powers, evil marines, everything. What also caught me is starting out with one boy and one dream, and making that dream seem more and more real by the battles and crew-mates he finds along his adventure.  
 
I guess I like the flavor of starting off small and crawling your way to strength and ambition, but this anime just packs that flavor into one huge ice cream sundae. With a friggen cherry on the very top. I really have only praise for this masterpiece. Unforgettable characters, amazing scenery, endless adventure.  
 
Simply put. I never want it to end.

    If you asked me about One Piece, i would tell you that it's one, if not the greatest shounen ever, with fun characters, great adventure, fights, feels and backstories. Once you specify that you're talking about the Anime? Oh boy. The adaptation is done by Toei animation. At first it wasn't terrible. The animation has always been kinda Meh but i can take that without that many issues. However, in the Skypiea Arc i've noticed a reused soundeffect from Dragon Ball (the fuck?) and i started to get a little salty about the adaptation. After the 2 year time skip it was getting worse and worse, animation, sound, pacing, comedy. All of it was getting worse by the minute. 
 
Now, at around episode 820 the issues are worse than ever.  
You see, the anime is catching up to the manga, but they don't want to stop cranking out the anime, nor do they want to go the Filler route. So instead they stretch it out as much as possible. So much so that about half of the ""content"" in the current anime epsodes, isn't in the manga.  
For example, the fights. In the manga they are emotional and hype. In the anime, you see them talk for 3 minutes, than it's gonna focus on someone else, than it gets back, a single punch is landed (that you see in stillshot for 2 minutes), than it cuts to other characters talking for 5 minutes......you get the point.  
Not only that the pacing gets fucked up like this. They often try to add comedic moments to make it more bearable. Except they fail. Hard.  
What you have now is such a chaotic and slow development of characters plot, butchered comedy and basically everything else that's been altered by toei is shit too.  
Stuff that takes a chapter in the manga, takes 3 episodes in the anime. Not only that, but at the start of each episode, there's a ""recap"" of the last episode, then opening, then stuff happens (but not really), then there is ending and preview for the next episode. Just like that, 24 minute episode has 12 minutes of the actual anime, which consists out of 8 minutes of exposition, 2 minutes of stillshots and 2 minutes of actual content. 
 
One piece is great, don't take me wrong. Hell at the start of the anime, it was pretty good, but as time went on, it kept getting worse and worse and now i consider it borderline unwatchable. 
  
TL;DR 
If you want to experience the Magical journey that is One Piece, read the manga. the anime is a little over 820 episodes ATM so catching up will take you a while, and once you do catch up, there's no hype or emotion, just ruin and a hollow shell of the manga  that's been beaten to death by toei.

    man, what can i say about this show....in america i 1st saw one piece on fox for kids, and i thought it was the worst shit i had ever seen in my life, because us sloppy americans like to make &quot;cartoons&quot; kid friendly so they took all the great things japan did with one piece out and made it really gay, not to mention the voice acting was TERRIBLE.....BUT I checked it out again in 2007 and found it bareable..........as the show moved on i just thought wow i love this show......luffy and the rest of the characters are great......i even like the characters that i wouldnt necissarily like if they were on another show ( ussop and nami) this epic is great, they do everything really well. when theres drama its great..when there comedy and funny as hell, the fighting is great, the Story is fantastic,i love everything about one piece. hence the reason why its my favorite show, idk when a show is going to knock it out of the number one spot, but when it comes along, ill be shocked.

    First things first; forget about the number of episodes. For this truly doesn't matter for once you start you won't want to stop. This show is an EPIC and is one of the best the adventure genre has to offer! 
 
I first saw an episode of One Piece years ago and thought that was pretty good and then didn't cross my mind until I started to get into anime more. What really put me off was the sheer number of episodes there was and thought that there must be a sh*t ton to fillers like Naruto. While Naruto in like 75% filler One Piece only has 58 filler episodes which I even enjoyed watching. Strangely I keep wanting more fillers now, strange right?  I asked my friend who reads the manga 'They must have found the One Piece by now, right?' he said 'Not yet' this got me interested. So I decided to pace myself and start watching it thinking i'll take this slow and pace myself. 3 weeks later... where are the rest of the episodes?!?!?! 
 
Story - 10 - They story is about Monkey D. Luffy's journey to become the King of the Pirates along with his crew mates who each have a harsh past and a dream of their own that they wish to fulfill on this journey along the Grand Line. They travel to new places making new friends and new enemies along the way. Now that may seem simple but one of the best things about One Piece is that it is an ever expanding universe where everything is intertwined and nothing is insignificant. 
 
Art - 9 - Now the art in One Piece may not be anything like the Fate series, but that doesn't matter. This is a show about pirates who starts from nothing and grows to be recognized world over. Just how the story and crew grow and develop, so does the art. The art starts out very simple (keep in mind that this started in 1999) and at first put me off a little since I was used to art like Fate and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo but it eventually grew on me and suddenly I didn't  care anymore and started to really like it. Now at episode 717 the art has become cleaner and more fluid, while I look back and think how well the art reflected the story in the early episodes (That being said there isn't anything wrong with the art now). 
 
Sound - 10 - ALL THE OPENINGS ARE GREAT (I am even playing them in the background while writing this review =) ) ! They dubbed the first few openings and I think they did them really well and prefer them over the subbed versions. They are all memorable and catchy. They make you want to watch them all the way though every time. Every soundtrack is great and reflects each scene splendidly. Very WELL DONE! 
 
Characters - 10 - Since I could go on forever about the characters, I will try and keep this short. If you want character development then this is one of the best. Each character develops a lot (Especially Nami =P)  While they travel together they form bonds with each other and we get to know what drives each character to do what they do. I don't want to spoil anymore since this is a big part of watching the show so i'll just say that you won't be disappointed with the character development since it does is done EXTREMELY WELL.  
 
Enjoyment - 10 - You should be able to tell from my review that this is one of my favourites. This show and all of the characters will always hold a place in my heart.  This is one journey that you don't want to miss. I watched One Piece dubbed from episode 1- 384, and would recommend it for everyone. The dub is good from that point onward but I watched it  in subbed because the dub wasn't out yet and I really enjoyed it.  
 
Don't be turned off by the number of episodes. Even if you only watch 2 episodes a week I would recommend starting it. The adventure is still going and will last another decade. Plenty of time to catch up! See you on the Grand Line my nakama!

Subbed or dubbed (Funimation)? - I think that the dub is more enjoyable for the first 384 episodes at least. I couldn't watch the subbed version of the early episodes. To me the Japanese voices are really annoying. The subbed version is better after episode 384. I would say it's slightly better than the dubbed version.

its got a great mix of humour and action not just all serious stuff but its a really good anime i really highly recommend watching this

    ok, let me just start by saying that approx 25 episodes in (with my friends pushing and screaming at me to continue watching) i got caught up in the storm. Every arc begins calmly, and ends in shock/epic , and they always do it right. With this many episodes, theyve set a parallel universe in our minds, and all this is due to 50% Luffy and 50% everything else: 
 
because Luffy, although he looks simple, is just the ultimate favorite character i have ever seen in all the animes i can think of. 
 
and i have never seen a more powerful redefining of the word CONFIDENCE in all my life. if you havent seen it, what are you waiting for...

    This series is just awesome, that's all there is to say. 
There are a lot of unique items/attacks/characters in this series, and Luffy keeps the fun going! 
 
What I really wanted to write this review to say is: 
If you're going to watch it, which you should, watch the Kaizoku Fansubs. I really can't stand any of the other subs. They screw it up in so many ways. In one case, I don't even know how they got &quot;Gomu Gomu no Mushi&quot; mixed up with &quot;Gomu Gomu no Rocket&quot; it's just THAT bad. Kaizoku sub it the best, Staw Hats off to them. :P

    *Spoiler Free Review* 
One Piece is an Anime about Pirates, Mainly one crew of Pirates called ""Straw Hats"". It is a action adventure anime, where the characters have special powers and are super strong. 
 
The Main storyline isn't that amazing, It's typical boy has a dream, boy goes out to obtain said dream, but what is amazing is the side storys that mixes into the main story, and there are tons, most of these are character background or goals, but it all fits in very nice, due to how big the One Piece world is, and how well the characters are devolped. The main reason I gave Story a 7 is due to the real main story, it's been done tons of times. 
 
The artwork and animation in this Anime gets alot of negitave response, but on the whole i'd say its average, its not rubbish by any standard, and sometimes has some very nice effects, But it's not the best out there. Don't be put off by the people who list the animation as why one piece sucks, because its the most stupidest thing ever, people still play old video games and watch old anime, do people complain about the graphics/ animation in them? No.  
 
The Sound is this Anime is epic, The Voice actors are very good at their jobs eppeically Zoro and Luffy. The Music is full of epic win! Most of all, all of the sound effects sound like the real thing, which is always a good thing, you know somethings up when a sword sounds like a wet fish hiting a rock. 
 
The Characters are very well devolped, even the majority of the lesser know characters have somewhat of a devolped background and continue to devolpe in the anime, something most animes don't have. I like that One piece does this, as it adds to the well written universe the creators have made, and it also allows the One Piece world to expand. 
 
To finish things off, the amount of enjoyment i get out of this anime has only ever been rivaled by Death Note, comparing it to other animes of the same genre however, nothing has came close to topping how well everything in One piece goes, and sometimes I hope that the show will never end, because I find it that much of an enjoyment to watch. 
 
So go check it out, if it sounds intresting to you, if not, well i guess my review skills suck, and you should go read a diffrent one piece review :P

    This review will cover the first “half” of one piece (Ep 1-516) just so you can tell what period this is based on but I won’t give any spoilers so calm down. 
 
Let me start by saying my first introduction to one piece was through the 4kids dub and I have to say I didn’t mind it. Of course a few years later when I watched the original subbed version it really shows the major flaws with the 4kids version luckily I didn’t get too far into it. I have seen some of the FUNimation episodes and for those of you who do prefer English dub that would be the way to go. 
 
Now for the review… 
 
Story: One piece’s story is one of the best constructed anime series around, you watch it back and you can pick up references to people or events over 400 episodes in the future… that’s a well thought out story line. You see Luffy grow from a young child to a capable captain of a crew, dreaming of being king of the pirates! It’s not only Luffy that has a goal, every crew member has their own dream and these are explored as well. Each member of the Straw Hat crew is a main character, while not being as focused as Luffy, you see everybody’s backstory making every person someone you become attached to. One of the best features of this series is that it can deliver on the paths it chooses either if it’s a more fantasy styled setting like Skypiea or a hectic battlefield at Marineford each setting works in the one piece universe and the emotional connection you end up getting towards each character makes the comedy/heartbreak/success/failure of each plot a gripping one.   
 
Art: Honestly, when I first started watching it I didn’t enjoy the art style compared to other animes and a lot of the people I showed it to at that time had similar opinions but once you watch it for a bit it grows on you and you wouldn’t want to have it any other way. The way Oda has drawn the characters really has given him the opportunity to throw some very “unique” looking characters into the mix in the future episodes without them seeming out of place.      
 
Sound: The music and sound effects are perfect, if you watch the first OVA of One Piece you can hear the dominant sound of rubber being stretched every time Luffy makes an attack, while good for effect they made it look like it took a lot of effort in order to stretch. The anime series changed this making the sound not as harsh and as a result it makes the action more free-flowing. The music itself sets the mood exactly like it should and the times where a song you know becomes dominant in the series when something is about to go down really increases the effect the scene has one you. The voice actors also do a terrific job of conveying the right tone and volume for each scene. 
 
Conclusion: In the end I base my scores on how much enjoyment I felt while watching each series and in this series 10/10! And I don’t like giving out 10s but from the amount of wondrous time one piece has given me… it’s worth it and you should definitely watch it. 
 
 
First review, any feedback would be good to help improve future reviews. 
Thanks for reading.

    One Piece, originally a manga written by the genius Eiichiro Oda, was adapted into an anime in 1999.  
 
Both the manga and anime are still ongoing, even after hundred of episodes and chapters, and yet One Piece still remains more exciting and thrilling than ever. Even after 400 episodes, the story is getting better and better. It is extremely hard and rare to find animes that have more than 100 episodes... and to never loose its pace is surly an accomplishment.  
 
Oda has done something rare - he has created a convincing alternate reality with thousands of interesting characters and places. Each are unique and bizarre in their own way. 
 
One Piece is a unique and epic masterpiece which tells the story of a young pirate, named Monkey D. Luffy who sets off to sea to gather a crew and to become the most famous pirate who ever lived, by becoming the Pirate King.  
 
The character interaction between Luffy and his crew mates is brilliant in One Piece and never becomes dull. After hundreds of episodes of this show, I gradually became attached to Luffy's crew. This is much drama, fighting, and comedic moments in this grand anime. 
 
Since this show was made in 1999, the art for the first couple of episodes can turn people away from this series. The art, of course, gets a lot better as the series progresses and was always interesting for me regardless. It is always inticing to observe the bizarre and intriguing world that Oda has created. 
 
The soundtracks are also classics, and even to this day I occasionally listen to them on my youtube playlist. 
 
Watching One Piece has become a sort of a ritual for me, as I have been watching a new episode every weekend for the past couple years. One Piece is a timeless show that I plan to watch for years to come!!

    It's just sooo sad to see how shows like Bleach and Naruto are more popular than One Piece...it just goes to show how understimated this show rlly is... 
 
This is one of the few anime that have evrtyhing you would want in any series, from awsome action sequence, to hilarious comedy and then to drama. This is the only series, besides elfen lied, that has made real tears come from me. 
 
People shouldn't put a barrier between this show because the art style, which is what most ppl have problems with in this series, just because the style is unique and trying something new is not bad at all. Also, it shouldnt be judged by the bad job done on the dubbing of the series which totally killed it. 
 
There is a character for evryone here and anyone that truly calls themselves an anime fan should definitely give this show a try. It's no mistake the manga is #1 in Japan and since the naime is exactly like the manga...well u kno. 
 
Anyway, just don't judge a book by its cover and give it a shot!!!

    ""A man's dream will never die"" 
 
When I started my venture into anime, there were three shows that I told myself that I was not going to watch: Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. This is because these three show have one thing in common: They're still on the air. Watching a lot of anime is as bad as it sounds, but watching something and trying to catch up with is even worse. Plus, I mocked these three series for their appeal to the younger crowd. Then, suddenly I was told that One Piece, the childish-looking one out of them all, is actually the best out of all of them. To be honest, I always thought One Piece was the butchered piece of crap that was presented to me by 4Kids when I was younger. Then I found out that Funimation picked it up and re-dubbed it when 4Kids went out of business. I watched the first episode of Funimation dub...I have now seen all 10 movies, 430 episodes, and watched most of the OVAs. 
 
In other words, One Piece is one of the greatest and most addicting animes of all time. 
 
How could a show that I once regarded as juvenile be masterful? Well, first off it's not juvenile, in fact it's quite brutal. At first, it's starts off normal. We are introduced to our protagonist, the carefree and determined Monkey D. Luffy, the self-proclaimed future king of the pirates. He seeks to achieve this goal by forming the best pirate crew, sail the whole world, and find the legendary treasure, the One Piece. This is our first step into the brilliance of this show. Luffy, while not the brightest person and well-mannered person, is the character we as the audience want to look up to. While some can debate that his decisions always tend to cause destruction and violence, it's that utter lack of not having fear that chills go down my spine. It's the idea that we must go on our own adventures in life and pursue our dreams even if others say that they're dead and unreachable. 
 
However, we've all seen this story before right? There have been numerous stories about going the distance and following our dreams. What makes One Piece so different then? If I were to summarized One Piece in one line then it would be this: One Piece cuts the bull shit. Most stories about going the distance always have that one point where the characters give up or something happens that prevents and then something happens that suddenly makes them want to move forward. One Piece...there is no such thing. One Piece is all about becoming stronger. Stronger to stand up for the people you care for, stronger to advance on your journey, stronger to be ready for that final goal. This is One Piece's true accomplishment. 
 
The show also has a strong sense of humor. There are so many times where I have chuckled and even laughed out loud from the comedy of this show. Even if it's running gags such as Zoro's lack of direction or Sanji's weakness for beautiful women, there is always something fresh and some sort of new take on it. 
 
This leads me to my next point. One Piece not only emits happiness and laughter, but all other emotions as well. Emotions such as sadness, fear, hope, love, and sometimes even anger. We as the audience feel this because our main characters feel it as well. I can say that you will probably find something about yourself in the form of these characters. For example, like Luffy, I have always have had tried to fight for that one dream. Like Sanji, while his actions are exaggerated a bit, even I have to admit that I have always catered to woman's needs more than men. Like Usopp, I have always have felt like the weakest of group, the one who is inferior compared to my stronger peers. Like Robin, I have always felt like the one who was misunderstood, the one who has been labeled by society as this type of person. One Piece shows that sometimes it's okay to be different because even when the whole world is against you, there are people who will stand by your side and will fight to protect you. 
 
These character only then are brought to life by the people who play them. I have seen the first 205 episodes in English and it shows off what Funimation does best and makes up for what 4Kids did. After that, I switched from the English, as new dubbed episodes are coming out later this year, to the Japanese track where the voice acting is also top notch. It was interesting to know that some seiyuus here are actually well known. For example, Chopper's seiyuu is Pikachu, Zoro's seiyuu is Mugen from Samurai Champloo, and the one that I think that a lot of you are going shocked by is that Usopp is voiced by Kappei Yamguchi, the voice of L and older Detective Conan. Right now I have been introduced to the character Boa Hancock and her seiyuu is Kotono Mitsuishi, the original voice Sailor Moon, the voice of Misato from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Excel Excel from what else than Excel Saga. The voice actors do amazing jobs in both languages giving some truly powerful performances. It should also be addressed that the score to One Piece is unforgettable. The music of One Piece not only matches great anime scores such as Cowboy Bebop's or the original FMA anime, but even stacks up to John Williams and Danny Elfman film scores. Trust me when I say that after watching the show for a long time, background music will become so familiar to which you will start humming plus also indicating the type of situation that lies ahead. 
 
The animation of One Piece is also something of noteworthy. Unlike, traditional animes, the animation of One Piece is more of like of that of a combination of old animes, American cartoons, and in the hi-res episodes like that of conventional animes from today. In a way, it's a something of it's own style, probably the one thing that will make anime fans, who are used to animes looking like shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, not want to watch to this show. However, the cartoonish visuals of One Piece only makes it unique from everything else. While we do see some carbon copies of characters here and there, not often does a character look like another character and have the same personality. I tell you one thing, I have to admit while characters like Nami or Robin or any of the women in this show do have ridiculous anime proportions, it only makes me wonder are there woman in the world that possibly exist (oh it's times like this that hate that I'm a geek). 
 
However, this also allows me to say what you should know when watching it. Do not question anything that happens. I know that's a weird thing to say considering that ""no duh it's a cartoon it shouldn't be taken seriously."" However, I say this because the thing is the show keeps you so invested that you forget that a lot of wacky cartoonish things occur and some animes of this nature like to take themselves seriously when they shouldn't. Luckily, the show is aware of itself and often makes meta jokes about the characters and the situations that occur. 
 
I have seen a lot animes and the ones that I consider my personal favorites I wish have lasted longer than just 26 or 51 episodes. One Piece, on the other hand is still running to this day and to be honest when that day comes, it's going to be sad seeing the final adventure of the Strawhats. I love One Piece, it moves away from the standard conventional ideas and gives them the middle finger. Damsel in Distress, screw that, we already have two ladies that that can kick ass. Living by government rules to which One Piece answers, ""there is no honor in the government, it's full a people stubborn people who only do it for the sake of following orders."" What about villains? Clearly all of them have the same personality right? ""who is the real villain here, is it the government hunting the pirates, is it the other pirates, or it could it possibly be Luffy and the rest of the Strawhat Crew who are the real villains here?"" One Piece on the surface may look like the average shounen but deep down there is something more than just skinny yet large chested women and cool action fights. I'll just say this right now: One Piece is the first anime that made me cry. More than Wolf's Rain, Clannad, and Grave of the Fireflies. One Piece will be and should be remembered among anime fans as something as a tale of hopes and dreams. If you have not seen One Piece, then there is no better time than to start watching now. How can I put this: If you wanted to choose out of the big three (four if you include now Fairy Tail) shounens, then One Piece is your answer. I love it and I swear you are going to love it as well.

    The Story -  It starts out feeling Cliche with &quot;im gonna be king of the pirates&quot; by finding one piece! but really the story more revolves around Luffy wanting to go on adventures and if there's one thing that One Piece delivers on its the feeling of a huge world and a very very Epic adventure that you are almost not gonna get in any other anime.  
 
The Art - alot of people do not like the art style of one piece. but i myself find it very unique, so you actually feel like you're watching something very different in a very good way. 
 
The Sound - One Piece, in my opinion, has some of the very best japanese voice actors and the music in it is just phenomenal when something big happens you know its something big because the music that goes along with the show complements it all so well. 
 
Characters - unlike what seems to be the current standard of emo main characters and clingy annoying girls, this show breaks away from all of that using a very enthusiastic main character, and instead of a girl a clingy guy that is handled in a comedic manner instead of annoying. This show also has possibly the best character development of characters in any anime i have ever seen. when you watch the show you real get to feel like you know the character instead of just watching them. 
 
Enjoyment - You may look at the length of the show (which when this is written was almost 400) and say &quot;I'd prolly get bored watching such a long anime&quot; but this is not the case as the show just gets better the further you get. 
 
Overall - this anime is a must see for anyone who likes anime. and do not, i repeat, DO NOT watch the 4kids Dub, watch the sub, or else its a whole different experience.

    One Piece is one of the three kings of Shounen. This is an undisputed fact. The anime started back in 2000 (the manga in 1997), and has been going strong for over 10 years now. Given that, I think it's fair to say that if nothing more, something's gotta be going right for it to last that long. 
 
Now I, like everyone else who has reviewed the show, am giving it a 10, a rave review, and overall I've lopped off one of my fingers and replaced it with a thumb, solely to gain the ability of giving this show 3 thumbs up. But understand, I've re-watched this series from the beginning 4 times now, and read through the manga twice. I know One Piece inside and out, and I'm not here to simply rave. I'm here to give it a fair review. 
 
Shounen Syndrome is an anime infection with symptoms ranging from over-exposed attack explanations to lengthy conversations where they aren't necessary to horrendous filler arcs and even all the way to episode recaps that take up a good quarter of the time the episode is alloted. 
 
One Piece is not immune to this. No attack can simply go unnamed, or unexplained. Though they'll only explain it once, and it's usually not as horrible as it sounds. Though One Piece is in an interesting position in that they know it's ridiculous. The joking nature of the characters often brings up the ""It's not cool if it doesn't have a cool name"" mentality. So you could let One Piece off the hook to some extent, as it almost satirizes the rest of shounen by participating. 
 
One Piece also did something I'm not a big fan of. Starting around episode 300, they started using opening themes that lasted a full 2 and a half minutes. Followed by 30 seconds of intro, and then 30 seconds - 3 minutes of recap. Sometimes you'll have to start watching 6 minutes into the episode to actually get to new content. But this is both a blessing and a curse. For you see, One Piece filler tends to be pretty horrible. So, around episode 300, they upped the animation quality for widescreen TV. And to be able to put out this quality animation once a week, a shorter episode time makes the jobs of the animators easier, and production more cost effective. This meant a more quality product, in shorter spurts. The shorter spurts however, contribute to less filler. And for this reason alone, the reduced episode time and long recaps are in fact a blessing for One Piece fans. Though not many would know it. 
 
So what about the actual show? I'll assume if you're on this page, you already know a bit about One Piece. It's a show following the adventures of Monkey D Luffy and his ragtag crew of pirates searching for the great treasure ""One Piece,"" with the ambition of becoming the Pirate King (the one who rules over the greatest seas of the world). The story is solid, and has only been better developed over time. Oda has done something wonderful, in that he had his story planned out long before it got there, and it seems he's having even more fun with One Piece now than at the start of his career. This contributes greatly to the enjoyment factor One Piece provides. 
 
The art style is the biggest complaint I've heard about One Piece. A lot of people have told me they just flat out disliked the art style, and that was one of the biggest reasons they didn't want to watch the show. Though I can't understand this, I guess One Piece's art style is more cartoony than most anime. But that art style reflects the values of the series. It IS cartoony, in spirit. That's kind of the point. That being said, if that's not your thing, I can respect that. The other thing to mention about the animation is that it's been going since the year 2000. As such, earlier episodes definitely aren't up to snuff in terms of animation quality, especially as it's a shounen with a budget. But as the series and time progressed, the animation quality progressed as well and is now very well done. 
 
By far though, the characters in One Piece are what you enjoy the most. Luffy is your typical anime shounen, the kind of guy you can't help but love. He's simplistic and dim-witted, but his heart's in the right place and that's what sticks. Everyone is well written and typed, and the character development throughout the series is rather impressive. New synergies arise that both reflect Oda slipping into a more comfortable mindset whilst writing his character's parts, and the characters themselves becoming more accustomed to each other. 
 
Overall, One Piece has been going 10 years. And in those 10 years, the crew has grown up and developed with it's audience. Even given it's Shounen faults, it still does an absolutely wonderful job of story telling and entertaining. The main point I would bring up is never watch the 4kids dub. It's not One Piece. If there was one example I could provide to convince you of this, they turned a french chef into a brooklyn accented disaster... smoking a lollipop. 
 
That is One Piece. My most timeless anime. It's an experience I would recommend to any and all anime fans, though I know it may not be a good fit for many.

    I absolutely must write a review for One Piece because it's my favorite anime to date. Shonen-action wise, I think that One Piece easily beats competitors such as Naruto and Bleach. (Apparently, in Japan, it has sales that outrank Naruto and Bleach combined? That's quite the opposite of its status in America lol) Anyways, One Piece is an epic anime series. It has the awesome fighting that a shonen fan needs, it has an EPIC storyline, great character designs, (I love basically every character that Oda introduces other than the villians he makes that readers are suppose to hate so that when he gets his ass kick it'll be so much more satisfying, of course) an awesome awesome soundtrack, lots of intense drama, and just overall greatness. I even enjoyed *most* of the fillers; I felt that they were somewhat on par with the canon. It's a definite must watch for...everyone...WATCH IT!

    Well..let me make it simple for everyone..Its about this young boy who sets out on a journey to fulfill his dream of being the pirate king and finding the all time treasure known as One Piece. Gold D Roger the previous pirate king,had been captured and on the day of his death sentence he told the people hat he had left his treasure in the grand line which then started the great pirate age.The devil fruits in this anime grants inhumane power to anyone who eats it but is cursed to never be able to swim. 
People who havent watched this anime to watch it!!!!!!.If u have watched the 4kids dubbed version just erase it from your mind and watch the japanese version.Its funny and the way the characters are voiced are just absolutely great.In the beginning arcs it may be a little boring for some viewers but trust me and i seriously mean trust me..it gets way way way funnier and it gets way more interesting in the later episodes.believe me.To me there may be some expressions they make which can look a little lame but come on man nothings perfect :P.. 
 
Art: as for the art..u cant say its awesome.Its a little old and all but who cares XD you'll get used to it eventually if u continue watching :)  
 
Sound: good voice actors and actress that voices their characters ..i think they're very talented 
 
Character:Monkey D Luffy(Main MAIN character) .Along with his trusting crew mates .Roronoa zoro the swordsman , Sanji the perverted cook that loves women lol , chopper the doctor in the crew - shy and adorable, Nami - the navigator shes witty and quite violent, Nico Robin the archaeologist - she loves anything related to history, Usopp - the sniper of their crew, Franky - the ship wright of the crew and lastly Brook- im not so sure what he is but i know that hes a perverted dead skeleton dude that came back to life therese characters wont be introduced immediately but they will slowly be introduced later in the series 
 
Enjoyment: so far i have to  say this is a very enjoyable anime 
 
Overall id give it a 9 or 10 becos its really awesome :3

    After years of brushing it off, I decided to finally marathon the show about a month ago, and well, it’s not half bad if I’m being honest. 
 
Positives: 
 
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a setting as big and explored as the world of One Piece in any other anime before (And I’m guessing this is why it’s so popular too). It’s so imaginative and vibrant, so much effort is put into explaining how the setting works in terms of geography, history, factions, religion, government, lore, etc. Everything in the universe links together and many plot threads are consistently carried over and tied into future story arcs, to the point where I would never believe you if you don’t told me he was making it up as he went.   
 
The whole cast of characters all have unique character designs and distinct personalities. The main cast is quite fleshed out; you learn almost every detail about them, and their views and priorities slowly change over the course of the series. Same can be said for most side characters, and to some degree, they receive more character development than the main cast.  
 
The soundtrack is great and really matches the tone of the series (My favorite being “Overtaken” and the “Stone Storage Room”) and also compliments the scenes (The scene “Walk to Arlong Park” comes to mind). 
 
Negatives: 
 
Animation; the quality is just not good. It was decent at the start but gradually got worse as the series went on and really hit rock bottom after the timeskip (It looked like I was watching a slide show). 
 
It’s repetitive, some story arcs follow this structure of Go to new island->Residents have a dilemma->Fight & beat villain->Go to new island->Res… 
 
Pacing; this is why I will be dropping the series at this point, and will be switching to the manga (Eventually). IT’S SO SLOW. The pacing, just like the animation, was decent at the start but gradually got slower to the point where it felt like almost nothing was happening for 23 minutes. I even had to visit the wiki to find out that some story arcs are actually longer in the anime than the manga, and this is without filler, meaning that they adapt less a chapter per episode, just, no. 
 
Overall, it has its faults but it’s a fine shonen (At least until the timeskip where the animation severely declines), and this is what I would ultimately consider to be THE adventure shonen.

    The story of One Piece is a long and enjoyable experience. It makes you care for the characters and their bonds; you become emotionally invested in their success. However, the anime is a disappointment to say the least. The length of scenes are stretched to a ridiculous degree. Every episode covers one chapter, but that includes an intro song, an outro song, and a long unnecessary recap. If you catch up you will constantly be waiting a week just for the characters to almost do something. and as the series gets farther into the story the animation gets worse. If you are interested in this series; read the manga. Its a great story, but the anime just isn't worth the time investment.

    Episode 898 proved it again, this Anime is not worth the time. What happened? It began so strongly, with an anmiation and art-style which needed some time to get used to it but once you did, it suddenly fit. Moreso the story was so rich after a while, you didn't even think about it. 
 
But let us get to the present time.  
 
The most recent Episode showed perfectly what is wrong with One Piece. It drags too much. It takes up to 5 minutes and sometimes longer with one character building up his technique. To fill more time, the main characters fight side characters who have no purpose in the story than just to get beaten up. But it takes up so much time as if something interesting is happening. You learn nothing new, there is no story progress, but those battles takes 10 minutes and more of the airtime. It is always used for comedic purposes and to show how strong the mc is. We know. We saw it 6000 times already. It doesn't matter if you put cool music under it, even the music starts to become unbearable. The mangaka Oda knows, he draws one or two panels with those and moves on. 
 
The worst part are the One Piece apologists. And i don't mean those who truly enjoy the show and defend it, bless them. I mean those who see the problems, are aware of it, they don't like it either but since they protected and defended this show since the beginning against Naruto and Bleach, yes that far back the Big 3 times, it became their second nature. 
 
If i didn't invest so much time in this show i would've dropped it. The characters are likeable though some characters now became so one-dimensional, they became boring. I don't see this as much of a problem because i trust Oda to create an arc where they will get a progress. 
 
As already stated, the characters, even side characters are the strong point of this show. The story is interesting and is building up since years, though you still can't see where it is going. Enel going to the moon, when everybody thought he is just mad, seems to have a bigger plot role than thought. This is how One Piece catches you. You can engage in many theories and conspiracies. Who doesn't love to do that? 
 
I've long decided to read the manga and the only reason i watch the show is because of my little cousin who likes to come over and watch it with me, since i pamper him. He still enjoys it, but he is 8.

    3 Simple words: BEST ANIME EVER !!! 
 
The big 3: Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, but to me, One Piece is the only big one. 
 
This one contains the least fillers of the big 3. Even tough every character gets introduced over a couple of episodes (in which you learn about their history and create a real connection), all eps are relevant to the series. Even episodes that look like fillers at 1st, get some part in the main story afterwards... 
 
A friend of mine said I had to watch this anime and he was right, so now I'll tell you the same, WATCH IT.

    Initially I was wary of watching this popular shounen anime as I preferred shoujo or romance anime. I also thought the art was sort of wonky at first, but upon starting this show I was overwhelming pleased. The story and art are, for lack of better words, amazing. I began watching One Piece two months ago and caught up to the 455 episodes in that time and can't wait for more releases each week. Although OP is considered part of the Jump trifecta along with Naruto and Bleach it's really in a league of its own, far surpassing these two in enjoyment and story. Frankly, the others aren't worth watching at all. One Piece has amazing flow between episodes and VERY few filler arcs.  
 
Luffy is also one of the greatest main characters of all time and is supported by an amazing cast that really allows the viewer to understand One Piece's overarching theme of being ""nakama."" Even the secondary characters are extremely lovable.  
 
One Piece is definitely worth watching no matter what type of anime you are into. It definitely doesn't leave you disappointed.

                   I don't understand why some people were put off by the arts at first. I just thought it was different when I saw it. I enjoyed the first few episodes and laughed a good couple of times and quickly labeled this show as &quot;For entertainment only&quot; since I thought it was some sort of Random-Funny clip shonen that takes a while to end.  
 
               But as I continued to watch it and up to the Arlong arc, I was SHOCKED TO DEATH. I didn't know it could get so emotional and deep but it manages to be light hearted at the same time. I was so utterly charmed by Luffy and his crew's personality. They practically highlight each other perfectly, like the colors of a rainbow, they all stick together but each of them stand out, nobody is the same color. 
 
               Others are for you to actually watch and find out what it's really about. I mean, people don't just say it's good for no reason.

    I started watching this in 2008 and I was immediately hooked on it. I loved every bit of it - the pirate theme, the art style, the characters, the story. 
 
It has been pretty much amazing until episode 381, or in other words - the end of the Thriller Bark Arc. Up to this point, the plot lines of the arcs were really fantastic, the art style was good, the fights were engaging, I just couldn't wait to see the next episode. 
 
But after that point, where they were entering Shabaody Archipelago, the show somehow lost its ""magic"" for me. I suddenly didn't care as much about what happens next and the excitement was diminishing. At the time I didn't take notice of that, but around the time of writing this in 2019, I finally realized that I no longer care about One Piece anymore - I did not care about the characters, about the fights, about how the story goes on, I just kept tuning in every Sunday morning to watch the new episode, because it had become a part of my routine for over 7-8 years. 
 
Now the art style has changed and at first I was on board with with, but later on I started noticing that the unique character of One Piece is gone with this new style. The colors of everything look somehow really bright and vibrant, and yet, at the same time - really washed out and dull, especially now in Whole Cake Island Arc. Where everything is so colorful and yet it looks dull and boring. 
 
The cannon fodder enemies that get knocked out by the dozens and once and don't even have names used to look somehow more unique and quirky, now they look really generic and similar. The same observation can be made about the main characters and even the supporting characters, main villains and supporting villains. Enemies like Captain Kuro, Don Krieg, Enel, Crocodile, etc. looked unique and interesting, but now enemies like Charlotte Family who never made an appearance before look very uninspired, it's like the author wanted to make some random, generic weird characters for the sake of making weird and quirky characters, but he failed at making them unique. Even the art style of the Straw Hats changed from being quirky and likable to overly-perfect, refined and with that - somehow boring and unlikable. 
 
The story arcs in the first part of the series (up to and including Thriller Bark) were interesting and unique, but now they feel boring, prolonged and utterly uninspired. Even Dressrosa, which people praise as a good arc, I found it to be very boring and a drag. Arcs like from when Luffy fought Alvida up to Loguetown have been a precious experience for me that I will never forget. When they crossed Reverse Mountain and entered the quirky otherworldly Grand Line, everything on the excitement scale got turned to 893593548935843. It has been the most epic part of the series (all the way up to episode 381). 
 
Character development has been insignificant and at first that was okay, because the show remained happy-go-lucky without being boring, but by episode 870, the character development hasn't been very significant and coupled with the other (and growing) negative aspects of the series, it is becoming very hard to watch. 
 
Overall, I think that the author Eiichiro Oda's inspiration for One Piece has diminished or has completely disappeared. He probably only draws the manga with the only goal to finish it and retire. His passion seems completely gone and what made the anime/manga/series interesting and exciting doesn't exist anymore. At this point I've lost all interest to continue watch the series and will be dropping them, I'm considering moving to the manga at this point only to see how it ends. 
 
In my opinion the show stops being good after episode 381 and my personal advise would be to stop watching there and move to the manga. If you don't believe me, you can go ahead and continue to watch, but you will probably feel the same way like me after you catch up. 
 
EDIT: I tried reading the manga into Wano Arc and even that's boring and horrible. At this point I've completely dropped One Piece. I tried to rewatch it again from episode 1 to episode 381 with the original animation, but around episode 125 in Alabasta, I lost interest, not that it's bad, it's just not the same after seeing it.

    What can i say? Its a Masterpiece . All other stories only care about fights but not this one . One piece is about the Story. One Piece has great fights too but fights are not its priority. Watch it if you want great story with comedy,action,sadness all the different kind of emotions then definitely watch it .  
 
But if you're not hooked by episode 60 then drop it , its not for you. One Piece just gets better and better  with every arc. Even if it didnt hook you up after 40 episodes it will definitely hook you up at 200+ episodes point.

       What could possibly be more exciting then being a pirate sailing the seas battling against other pirates, getting into ruffles with the government at the same time searching for new crew members and for the ultimate treasure? Sounds like an adventure eh? The surprising thing about One piece is that every small thing to the very detail is done to the finest level. I cant complain about any facet of this show and ill tell you why.  
 
One piece does everything surprisingly well, it possesses an entertaining story, with interesting characters and even mixes in intense drama which is huge since the show is a comedy first type show. One piece starts off with the main protagonist Luffy, one of the most ridiculous looking pirates ever, in search of the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. This treasure was hidden somewhere in mysterious oceans known as the grand line by the greatest pirate in history Gold D. Rodger. Nearly every episode is hilarious as you watch this half-minded pirate do incredible things, meet incredible pirates and so on. For anyone who watches Action shonen animes like Naruto or Bleach, One piece actually does something better then those shows, it entertains fans nearly every episode(although a few fillers exist here and their, they are still quite entertaining) and it knows how to present a story with very fascinating characters. 
 
I&rsquo;m calling all anime fans to check out this great series but I would be doing you a disservice by not informing you of the fallowing: DO NOT WATCH IN ENGLISH SUBS. This show was introduced in Japanese and is excellent in its original without censorship. The American censorship attempts to water down the show for children by removing heavily violent scenes and explicit plots. The English voice actors are horrible as well&hellip; need I say more? Anyway watch one piece you are guaranteed laughs and an adventure.

    I deserve a trophy. As of this writing, I have watched 577 episodes. At the very least I'm entitled to a ribbon for participation. Please excuse the satire, yet fully stated, following One Piece is a life decision you can't go back on. I've heard stories and things labeled as 'larger-than-life' from time to time, which as a literal thing is hard to imagine, and I'll tell you One Piece is larger than those things. If something truly is larger-than-life, as some frightful things are, it would lose recognizably, and have to appeal on upheaval or shock. One Piece is not larger than life. Hear me say, with all appeal, that One Piece delivers as large as life can. 
 
Now the life of a subject notwithstanding, there's the honest directive. One Piece is indeed huge. The manga has been serialized since 1997 and the anime airing since 1999. I'm amazed every time I'm reminded of this. Stories are rarely if ever allowed a life so long. Sense dictates the market at large would become bored, yet it marches on. I've only come to the series in 2010 myself, which is truly stunning both how long it took to finish and how it still converts so far into its lifespan. 
 
Shōnen giants have meritable criticism. Drawn out plots, dragging episodes, truly few bursts of action, and many disposable characters. It would be a bold-faced lie to claim that One Piece is an exception. The popular obeys popular formula. Only the contrarian will find problem with that and, besides, unimaginable popularity is not well-liked by the hipster generation. I once held One Piece to disdain. 4kids produced a very awful dub I saw on saturday mornings as a kid. Its huge popularity seemed unjustified to my closed eyes. A fan of something so huge and bland would likely be boring, a sheep coddled by peers and fearful of anything outside their comfort zone. Simple minded fans always exist, so do not take my elitist prejudice to heart. It's no quality I'm proud of. 
 
Winter break listlessly rolled by. I was a freshman in college and belatedly frustrated with my social situation. That may or may not matter. Animation has never been a focal point in my life, but I will always very much enjoy a good story. It doesn't matter where or how it comes to me - just if it reminds me of something, anything, important. There are infinite ways to look at life. I'll tell you why I watch animation to tell you why I finished One Piece, because it is the same. I was looking for something to burn out with, insomniac halfway into winter, my strength fissured into coping instead creating. That is when I want things to move in front of me instead of me moving them myself.  
 
What made me choose to start watching One Piece, and I mean definitively, I cannot say. I reasoned I deserved to give the show another chance - it was popular for a reason or something along those lines - but looking back there was nothing logical behind it. There isn't much logic to go around at three in the morning. I watched twenty episodes straight, ending at noon the next day. The show's whimsy and optimism - in a same line Luffy's childishness and excitement - kept me rapt during a dank time. It may have been a false attachment at first, but from Zoro's backstory forward I was in a combined state of excitement and satisfaction. Episodes turned like simple pages in a story, speeding forward until I reached an insane one hundred episode total. A long show spans a hundred episodes, but One Piece barely begins. 
 
In the middle of the Arabasta arc, some hundred episodes in, I actually had to justify and think about why I watched the show. Before then, watching continued effortlessly, just as only wanting to know what happens. Whether or not a story provokes such a feeling is only a trick of pacing and has nothing to do with quality. Eventually, everything becomes evaluated, and despite being bored with the Straw Hats wandering forever in the desert, I found it was not simple joy, excitement, or shameful pacing that held my attention, though they did help. It was the show's surprising depth, not only in character development, but the attention to detail put into the entire world. 
 
If you make it to the Water 7/Enies Lobby continual arcs, know that you've reached the single part of the story that enables me to say One Piece matches up to any great and peerless execution of storytelling. There are many stories with that honor, however, that makes it no less of a feat. Without giving much away, there is driving contention in the crew caused by a practical problem and a more sinister one. A new character's main reason for living intersects with one protagonist's main reason to die. An old protagonist finally succumbs to his lasting doubts and shadows, acting most shocking and out of character for the genre - but thankfully not the show. The main villians are inexplicable and hard to believe at first, yet after, and somehow because of, initial appearances, they are more than enough to drive the story forward. The many conflicts, subplots, and rapid changes make this story arc the most complex and rewarding in the series and allow me to recommend One Piece to anyone without a shadow of a doubt. 
 
I nearly quit in the second half of the Skypiea arc. It encompasses many of the bad points of the show - many bland characters outside the main cast (from Enel's wacky helpers to the clueless Conis), overkill pacing (Satori's ridiculous ""Trial of Balls"" lasted like four episodes), and few moments of excitement (Chopper had the only respectable fight and it was against a guy who would forget to open his mouth when speaking). However, snuck close to the end of the arc are three entirely wonderful episodes concerning a Montblanc Norland. They have nothing to do with the main plot - even occurring 400 years in the past from the main characters - and yet is of the greatest subplots One Piece has. The show had before convinced me of a world to breathe in, but somehow it had me interested in its history, even without a real pay off. Anything concerning a Gol D. Roger is even more exciting and equally removed from Luffy's quest, all to an extent. There aren't many stories where even its history remains interesting and convincing. 
 
If you haven't seen the show, I realize my review isn't being very accessible anymore. There is so much to cover when something is so long, so I know not to try to cover everything. One Piece truthfully remains very consistent throughout its entirety. Though many major plotlines have been boring or even poor from times, the show has never been dedicated to a major plot, or it would have ended by now. When others describe why they enjoy the show so much, many point to its character development, comedy, art style, and its densely woven plot. Especially liked is the very intense chekhov's army. Characters and concepts introduced anywhere in the show appear and reappear when it's appropriate (and many times even when it is not, such as Usopp befriending giants for no reason than knowing other giants), but appropriateness truly does not matter, for the directive is to make events connected, so that the characters live in a present represented by a real past. 
 
There is beauty in telling a story about a world, instead of only about characters, or only about a thing. To use a daft example, the Lord of the Rings has a fantastic reputation as a fantasy novel, maybe even recognized for the wrong reasons (thank hollywood). The Lord of the Rings is a post-modern epic and I mean that literally. I shall define an epic that lives in its folklore and obeys it completely, like a recognizable Greek epic The Odyssey. I want to believe the greatness of an epic is not totally reliant on its heroic characters, though they contribute greatly. A fantasy epic takes a picture of an impossible world and makes it a possibility. Those are the simplest terms, but it is not the act of creation that is important, it is the completeness. The world's culture, laws, & customs are obeyed naturally in the telling and the characters, while important, impact overall a small part in history. 
 
When I think of Lord of the Rings, I don't think too much of its band of heroes, the struggle of good versus evil, or the strength of good nature. For me what stays is how detailed the world is and how far Tolkien went. It is a story about Frodo and the Ring, and yet it is a world of so much more. One Piece can be called post-postmodern, if you're silly, because it is very much simple and bright instead of being grim and refined. Wouldbe epics try to be grim and defined. And wouldbe epics do not have a world I believe in, which is why they're only caricatures of the worlds around us. One Piece, at a certain point, became a true fantasy epic. It is a story about Luffy and finding One Piece, and yet it is a world of so much more. Everything surrounding the characters oozes with careful thought. One Piece no longer feels only like Luffy's story or just the story of the Straw Hat pirates but a recounting of history by the movers and makers themselves - a fictional history that feels so very real. 
 
I remember my cousin over and we were eating pizza. It was shortly into winter break. My hand was my plate, pizza doesn't need a plate, but he was holding a plate with pizza. Eating pizza, holding pizza, he looked liked he wanted to say something and didn't know how. The need to share won over the insecurity of sharing and he asked me if I ever heard of a show called One Piece. Call it coincidence, still, I had just watched Luffy's final fight with Crocodile and was able to express how much I liked the show. He was a bit farther, starting the Davy Back fights if I remember, and was very excited that the insecurity never existed. He was excited he had someone to share this world with, I'd guess. At first, when we talked about the show, we would focus on the main characters and talk about what fights we liked, what lines we liked, what backstories we most appreciated, and inevitably what characters were the best. 
 
Two years later, we have both finished the show, and end up talking about it when we see eachother, at least to discuss the most current episodes. Sometimes the discussion spills over when either mentions how much we like the show, or how such and such used to be better, or what arcs we loved and hated. Now when we talk about One Piece it could easily last hours - it is, after all, nearly 200 hours long - yet we do not focus on the main characters as we used to. A comparatively small part of our talks touches on the protagonists, partially because we both know them so well, mostly because we're talking about the world at large. One piece has a world you can picture, a world you can really talk about, a world to be excited for. I very much like stories, as I say, but it's hard to say flat things about a whole world. I very much like worlds too. It's different, to say the least, and despite any insipid moment, I believe One Piece is a world worthy of any others and is an absolute joy to experience.

    I used to fall into the trap of &quot;The 4Kids dub = One Piece&quot;, so I figured One Piece was some totally lame series that only appealed to little kids. I actually got into One Piece after visiting a crack community on LiveJournal (capslock_op). I decided to check it out, but I was hesitant. Then, I ended up reading volumes 1-14 in under a month! (I know I'm reviewing the anime, but I read the manga first.) 
 
One Piece has very believable characters. The main crew members all have very real, very believable personalities. The storyline is interesting and easy to follow--hardly anything ever goes unexplained, so there are no loose ends or awkward plot holes (which is a problem I encountered with Bleach.) It has a great balance of humorous and serious moments.  
 
A lot of people seem to complain about the art style being &quot;bad&quot;, but I don't think that's the case. I think that One Piece's art style is appropriate for the mood and style of the series itself. It's entertaining and a little bit goofy. If One Piece's art style were &quot;better&quot;, it wouldn't be the same. Sure, sometimes there are some really oddly drawn frames, but the bulk of the animation is pretty good. Even some of the &quot;better&quot; animations have their &quot;wtf?&quot; moments.

    One Piece is a fun show, plain and simple. Normally, I'm all about serious, intelligent anime, but One Piece is my big exception. There are a lot of good, high class shows out there worth watching for the artistic value. But we can't forget the main purpose anime is designed for: entertainment. And when it comes to pure, non-thought-provoking entertainment, it's hard to beat a kid literally made out of rubber beating the crap out of a clown who can disassemble himself. (And that's just Season One! There's much crazier stuff than that.) 
 
What I love about One Piece is that it never even tries to be serious. The characters are all zany, yet they remain engaging enough to hold the attention of someone like me who looks for something with a little more substance than your average kid's show. New main characters are gradually introduced throughout the series, and each one makes a meaningful contibution. Most of these characters are added when Luffy, the self-appointed captain of this crew, randomly decides he likes them and wants them to come along which adds to the silliness. 
 
Another aspect of this show that sets it apart from the rest of the shounen action crowd is the consistency of the characters abilities. The members of the Straw Hat Crew are never forced to undergo some random quantum leap in power level in order to defeat their enemies. This means that despite the fact that the show is currently almost 350 episodes in length, none of the characters have experienced the continuous exponential increase in power seen in other shows that would otherwise give them the abilities of Superman by this point. 
 
Despite the length of the series, the material for each new episode is usually fresh, with a surprisingly small amount of filler and recap (though it does have some.) The action moves along fast enough that each new episode is simultaneously satisfying, yet leaves the viewer looking forward to the next one. 
 
I'd say the main weakness of the show is the tendency to crank up the cheesiness factor just a little beyond my tolerance point on occasion. Other viewers could be affected by this to a greater or lesser extent than I am; it's really all a matter of personal preference. One other disclaimer: do not watch the 4kids dubbed version. Just about any fansub is better, since the dub is censored and material is removed to such an extent that the quality is adversely affected.

    Before watching One Piece I was skeptical of watching it. It was one of the most popular animes out there but it just did not look like my sort of thing. Eventually my friend who got into anime started watching it and told me of its greatness, but I was still put off it. Finally after nagging me to watch it I caved in and started. I am glad that happened as it has to be one of my favourite anime's ever! 
 
Story (10) 
The story at first may sound simple. A young pirate sets out to find a crew and the lost treasure of one piece, although it quickly becomes more and more complex with all the stories of each character to the individual arcs. Oda has created a huge world like no other. Simply amazing. 
 
Art (9) 
The art at the start of One Piece may not look that great but that's because it was made in 2000. The art gradually gets better and throughout the 400+ episodes it starts to get amazing. Everything is thoroughly detailed. 
 
Sound (10) 
I loved the opening and endings to the anime aswell as the sounds that the characters make when they are doing their special moves. It makes the anime come alive. 
 
Character (10) 
One pieces characters are revolutionary. They are detailed in both art and story. The back stories of each character and their personalities are amazing. 
 
Enjoyment (10) 
One piece was a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs. Places when I would be in stiches from laughing or tearing up in some of the emotional episodes. One piece has everything in it from Comedy to drama to a bit of romance. I highly enjoyed this anime from start to finish. I nearly went 24 hrs watching episode after episode since It kept me wanting more. 
 
Overall (10) 
Overall I would rate this anime a 10/10 simply because it is unbelievable. I am glad that I gave this anime a chance and would thank my frend for introducing it. It is probably my favourite anime right now

    I created an account just so that I could write this review. I started watching One Piece four or five years ago, and still find myself moved by this amazing series. 
 
I have seen and enjoyed many anime, from Gintama, to Death Note, to Legend of Galactic Heroes, to Trigun, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, a plethora of Gundams, and many others. One Piece has something that none of them have. In fact, One Piece has something that perhaps no other form of motion picture entertainment today has:  rock-solid, consistently good writing. Good writing is hard to find, but good writing that can stay consistent and true to a massive overarching storyline through 500+ episodes?  
 
At first glance, One Piece presents itself as superficial, formulaic, light-hearted fun, but then it  catches you off-guard with its depth of character, its surprising plot twists, its amazingly complicated and well-developed world, and its wisdom into the desires of the human heart. It lulls you into thinking you've figured it out, and then surprises you yet again. Plot threads left dangling for hundreds of episodes suddenly become significant again and seamlessly weave themselves back into the storyline, and you realize that you are viewing a grandly designed epic that is genuinely designed to span years. 
 
I have seen far too many shows that start off great, and then reach a point where the author or writers start floundering around and basically start just making the plot up as they go along.  
*Cough*Cough*Bleach*Cough*Naruto*Cough*LOST,DEAR GOD LOST*Cough. 
 
Not so with One Piece. Every story arc fits into place in a larger tapestry of the main plotline, and does so in some amazingly imaginative ways. 
 
 
In terms of artwork, One Piece certainly can be strange, but overall it contains some of the most original and fantastic locations and character designs you will ever see, anywhere. In terms of animation, it does occasionally suffer from the fluctuating quality levels that most long-running series have. 
 
The pacing is good, in general, although there are a few times where it feels like certain events are dragged out a bit longer than necessary, although it never reaches Dragonball Z-like proportions. Many of the of the arcs feel like they slow down right before the big conclusion, but in a way this only heightens the emotion at the conclusion of each arc. And believe me, every arc has a powerful climax. 
 
The music is fantastic, although noticeably repeated. It's difficult to have original music for 500 episodes, after all, and it's only to be expected. Many of the tunes are very catchy, though, and I love how main characters are associated with particular themes in true Wagnerian fashion. 
 
The characters are the best part of the show, and I would rate this anime higher than 10 for character if possible. They are all fantastically written, both amusing and bad-ass, and tremendously consistent in personality. The Japanese voice acting for them is also utterly perfect, and while I admit some other anime dubs are decent, I highly recommend watching this one in the original language. 
 
One Piece never fails to move me emotionally, and always in a positive way, leaving me feeling better about life in general. Paraphrasing something Luffy said once, ""As long as you are alive, something good can happen to you."" I started watching this show with my friends years ago, and I will treasure that time spent, both as a reminder of some good times I shared, and because One Piece is simply an amazing journey. 
 
 
- Happy Sailing

    You'll either love it or hate it. There is no in between. 
 
The time is The Great Pirate Era. To find the treasure the legendary pirate Gol D. Roger left behind, One Piece, countless pirates have endured death. The boy who ate the Rubber fruit, Monkey D. Luffy, set out to the seas with the Pirate King as his goal. On his way, Luffy has met countless comrades. Today, they continue to sail through the greatest sea of all: The Grand Line. 
  
Accompanied by great soundtracks, Monkey D. Luffy and his nakama sail across the world. As they fight corrupt governments, bounty hunters or other pirates, they meet new friends, develop their character and occasionally give the viewer some comedic relief. The art may not be outstanding. Since the anime is catching up to the manga. there is some filler along the way and the recaps and previews are getting longer.  
 
So what? If you find comedy, fighting, music and character development in anime more important than anything else, you won't mind those small details. This is truly shounen as it should be.  
 
Note: I strongly recommend you watch the subbed version. Although Funimation did a quite good job on the dubs, it was abused by 4Kids before Funimation took over.

    Hands down, the best anime I have ever seen! 
 
 
Story is about a boy, Monkey D. Luffy who is aiming to become the Pirate king. On his way there he will need to conquer the sea, and meet up many new friends and ofc - Nakama. The everything is okay at first, but as anime progresses, story grows up to amazing proportions! I don't want to spoil all the great fun you could enjoy by watching it so i'l just give a few rates. 
 
Story: 9 - Pretty simple thing grows into something much wider and interesting, deserves the grade rightfully 
 
Sound: 9 - Great sound effects displayed through the series, even has few of it own songs (for instance ""Bink's sake"", really great one), and great sound effects. 
 
Characters: pure 10 - The crew meet up a whole bunch of characters, that are again - unique. I think that One piece has the richest line up of characters of all animes i watched,heard about or will watch in the future. And again nearly all of them played or will play, big or small role in the series. 
 
Enjoyment - Pure 10, as somewhat fan of anime, and BIG fan of pirates, I would personally give it 30/10, but that grade isn't available :D Even the ones that aren't necesserily fans of pirates/pirate era, will again like this series in some other way, because its simply flawless! 
 
Overall - Pure 10/10! 
 
 
P.S.  
As someone who experienced it, as well as many of other people as I heard, I must say from critic view that old ""4kids"" english dub did a pretty lousy job, poor voice acting and a lot of erased stuff. I almost dropped the series on episode 2 because of it. Back then I strictly watched DUBBED series, but I figured it would be a waste not to try, and tried out SUBBED version of the series, and I must say that I was STUNNED by a drastic change of the quality and enjoyment. So I just kept going on and on with the series, catching up in a really short period of time. I heard that ""Funimation"" started doing the job all the way from the start, in uncut version. Haven't seen it so I can't say anything on that subject, but I suggest you try SUBBED version anyway, after all it's original :))) 
 
 
My first review, hope it helps!

    You can understand that people have no taste when this anime has 8,53 score 
 
The best excuse one can give for liking this ""awesome anime"" is that it apparently teaches them friendship and bonds and tryhard or whatever, AKA qualities that every normal functioning human should already have 
 
Moving on to the story, everyone seems to forget that the show is about P-I-R-A-T-E-S, and who can blame them when people in said universe can drop meteors from the sky, transform into giant Chinese dragons etc. Yay for piracy 
 
Characters are beyond nauseating, as women only exist to be sexist symbols and as for guys the top IQ is probably around 50 at best. You have a main character which has a Rubber Fruit with over 100 abilities and uses, one more overpowered than the other. Super Saiyan Goku can destroy galaxies and in the crossover episode was even power with just Gear 2nd (iiii diii bUt He WaS hOlDiNg BaCk To EnJoY tHe BaTtLe diiiiiii) 
 
No moment can be taken seriously because you just got characters with giant mouths and teeth yelling, then some sad music plays and the viewers are supposed to sympathize, feel sad etc 
 
MC is beyond sickening, 0 character development and a non functioning brain (perhaps it turned into rubber as well), perhaps every 100 episodes or manga chapters he will glare at the bad guy or say some sort of inspirational quote about his friends yada yada and people will go nuts 
One could say that ""ii diiiii bUt SuPeR sAiYaN gOkU aLsO hAs A lOt Of FoRmS dilililiiiiiiiiii"" but the difference is that he's been training for all his life, plus people of his race could just as easily obtain the same sort of power and forms (as well as other races). In One Piece MC has the Rubber fruit which has over 100 forms and powers and hidden abilities, each unlocked randomly and when needed to defeat a certain opponent who's been honing their skills all the time (Doflamingo being top example). Basically Rubber Fruit > God in One Piece, as MC will defeat people who can use Darkness itself, Light itself, steal souls, Magma, drop freaking meteors from outer space, become chinese giant dragons who can spout flames, you probably can already realize that this is as ridiculous as it sounds 
 
Typical One Piece battle: Bad guy has insanely overpowered fruit which they have been honing for years and terrorize whole islands/cities/countries. Rubber boy: 
a) punches kicks or headbutts them to defeat with rubber powers instantly 
b) deus ex machina form / new move he unlocked during his during-timeskip training but never used till now cause why not 
c) for logia overpowered users, deus ex machina haki which can match theirs and surpass it > repeat a) and b) 
d) scream with a giant mouth and teeth cause that equals strength and justice 
e) ??? 
f) MC wins 
Also bonus points if all MCs sustain beyond death injuries during the battle, which they survive and recover from instantly (Zoro vs Mr.1, please someone do justify that), only to proceed to annihilate the bad guys immediately afterwards 
 
Bad guys just wait at their islands for MC and crew to defeat them, much like Pokemon Trainers in Pokemon games, they just exist there stationary till MC passes in front of them 
 
10-15 years since anime came out and creator has the nerve to say we are halfway done, yea good for you I guess, yay for creativity 
 
You can hate this review all you want but at the end of the day you know every bit of it is true, deep inside you know that the only reason you like One Piece is because you want to be a part of the mass

    One Piss is hands down one of the most childish and badly written Shounen I've come across. There is absolutely nothing interesting about One Piss. It fails at literally everthing it tries to attempt. These are the reasons why One Piss is trash. 
 
STORY: 0/10 
 
One Piss is about a trash character called ""Luffy"" that wants to become the pirate king. He gathers a crew of even more awful characters that also have dreams of their own. Almost all of these characters are one dimensional and do absolutely nothing to accomplish their goals. Nami wants to draw a map of the world, yet there isn't a single scene in the manga showing her draw anything. Usopp wants to be a brave warrior, yet after 800+ episodes he's still a coward. Sanji wants to find All Blue, he does absolutely nothing to accomplish his dream. Luffy wants to become pirate king yet there are so many filler arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with this.  
 
Here are some examples of arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with the story: Alabasta, Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Drum Kingdom, etc. None of these arcs have anything to do with Luffy becoming the pirate king, yet they each are at least 40 chapters. Even the arcs that are actually relevant are awful. Dressrosa is one of the most poorly written Shounen arcs I've come across. 120 episodes of one arc, bad characters that get too much screen time, generic villain with a generic back story, terrible animation, slow pacing, etc. It cant get any worse than that. For some reason Oda isn't capable of making a story arc that isn't extremely long anymore. He says that he isn't going to make long arcs after dressrosa, yet he makes even more bad arcs that are too long.  
 
One Piss arcs are essentially the same thing every single time. The plot is very formulaic. They go to an island and make friends, beat up the bad guys that are oppressing the country, new cremember (sometimes), feast, and then repeat. I mean it continues this bullshit over and over again for over 800 episodes. It already starts to get boring during the Skypiea arc, I'm surprised I could actually tolerate the rest of this trash. 
 
One Piss has some of the worst fights I've seen in Shounen. It's actually hilarious how One Piss fans criticize other Shounen like Fairy Tail because of ""friendship powerups"". One Piece does the exact same thing. Every single fight is won by Luffy's sheer willpower, not because he actually outsmarted his opponent. Every One Piss fight is the same exact thing: Luffy tanks evey hit, villain tanks every hit, but then somehow the villain loses because he isn't as durable as Luffy. This is why One Piece fights are extremely boring. It always just ends in asspulls/plot armor. Luffy has won many fights that he shouldn't have won, especially his battle against Katakuri. Katakuri injures himself because a random character interfered in their fight. If you cant see how much a contrived plot device that is, then I don't know what to tell you. 
 
One thing One Piece fans praise about this series is how good the world building is. In my opinion, it doesn't mean SHIT if One Piece has good world building. Why should I care about how detailed Oda made the world of One Piece when the crew is just stuck on one island for 100 chapters? The world building is irrelevant if we barely even get to see the rest of the world, besides the Island they spend 200 chapters on. For fucks sake they've only been on 5 for over 300 episodes. 
 
 
CHARACTERS: 0/10 
 
There are rarely any interesting characters in One Piss For the most part, all of the main characters are poorly written. They just get their sad and generic backstories and then they never get character development again. A perfect example of this would be Nami. Sad backstory, then gets no development for the rest of the series. Usopp is another example. After 800 episodes, Usopp still is acting like a coward. 800 episodes and yet he still didn't develop whatsoever.  
 
I used to like Sanji until post time skip One Piss completely ruined him. He hasn't had any shine in post timeskip. He loses every damn fight, and he wasn't even in the most important arc of the timeskip. Then Oda makes an arc all for Sanji, which ended up being absolute trash. He just gets a generic sad backstory, doesn't actually change as a character, and then he still gets no shine whatsoever. No one should ever compare this trash character to Zoro. 
 
Speaking about Zoro, he's the only straw hat that actually developed as a character. 
 
Luffy is hands down the worst Shounen protagonist of all time. Luffy has no character development. None whatsoever. He has no internal characterization at all. None. Any chance he had at character development was ruined because he just ends up going back to how he previously was. If an anime/manga is over 800 chapters/episodes long and the main character  doesn't have the abiltiy to reflect on his actions, then that's an absolute problem for the story. To be honest, there's nothing interesting about Luffy. He's just the basic Shounen protagonist that we always see in any Shounen.  
 
There are no good villains in One Piece. The only villain I enjoyed is Crocodile, yet he's just a generic villain anyways. Besides him, every other villain is bad. There are no complex villains in One Piece. None whatsoever!  
 
ANIMATION/ART: 0/10 
 
Do I even need to explain this? One Piece has the WORST animation I've ever seen in ANY anime. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree with this. I've never seen a Shounen with worse artstyle than One Piece. The characters look extremely ugly too, especially in the Whole Cake Island arc. I don't know why Oda loves drawing ugly ass characters. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 1/10 
 
How can I possibly enjoy an anime that has bad characters and a bad plot? The truth is, I cant. It was at least decent until Oda completely destroyed his manga. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because of Zoro

    One Piece is superb in MANY ways. The quality of both storyline, and production for this series was leaps and bounds over almost any other. Although I admit the artwork for a long stride of the series was only adequate, the epic storyline full of ambition, unique and enjoyable fight scenes, and a display of some of the most unique and down right amazing characters keeps this Anime at the top of the charts. The depth of the plot really only grows throughout the series, and the fact that you only get more interested as time goes on just goes to show how they've managed to last 408 episodes thus far(with many more to go). Their are two other great aspects to this, and many of my other favorite Anime, that should be touched on. The power-scale of One Piece is by far one of the most balanced and in check I've ever seen. Each character displays his or her own powers or unique abilities/traits without the sense of repetition. The second ""great aspect"" to the series is the party-up fashion the story takes. I personally LOVE when an Anime starts with a main character and as the events unfold they establish connections with others and for one reason or another unite. One Piece IMO has encompassed this in their storyline better than any other Anime. However other examples include Yuu Yuu Hakusho, and Rurouni Kenshin. The only negative thing I have to say about this show is the dubbed version. In Summation, for those of you that don't mind subtitles One Piece is a top notch Anime that shows great fight scenes, in depth characters, and a plot that will keep you marking your calendars for the release date of the next episode.

    The spiritual succesor to Dragon Ball (the original series), One Piece combines unforgettable cartoon visuals with knokout fight scenes and an epic plot Akira Toriyama never aspired to. 
In a fantastic world of vast seas, teenage Monkey D. Luffy-possibly the most cheerfully stubborn shonen anime caracter ever-yearns to raise a crew, become the King of the Pirates, and find One Piece, a legendary lost treasure. 
His special ability is the power to stretch like rubber, used mostly to beat up opponents, his special weakness is that, thanks to the same magic fruit that gave him strechy powers,he can never swim. 
the art gradually growing more detailed as the series gose on. 
The plot is set up like an RPG, as Luffy and his companions sail into a new area, become involved in the local troubles, fight the bad guys, and move on. 
Within this rough formula, however, grand plot threads are laid, 
and with each episode the world of One Piece becomes richer and more glorious: a tall-tale world of sea monsters, faraway kingdoms, cloud island, and superpowered pirates of every shape, size, and description. 
The mood is sheer over the  top  melodrama, every line is weeping, laughing, or shouting said with enough winking humor to be enjoyed by jaded hipsters as well as kids. 
The series is notable for its incredibly bloody and intense fight scenes in wich, however no one ever dies. 
 
I have seen the series two times: in englis,German and Japanese and strongly recomande it !!!

    Considered by some to be the heir to the throne of Dragon Ball in terms of Japanese market penetration, One Piece is certainly a phenomenon. The manga's print run recently outpaced Dragon Ball and the series, at more than 130 episodes, is still going strong. It's easy to see why; One Piece follows a very simple and very successful shonen action formula. It worked in the past for Rurouni Kenshin and Dragon Ball and it's working wonderfully for One Piece. The premise is pretty basic. Luffy D. Monkey, an irrepressible youth, ate the Devil's Fruit, which gave his body extra-strength elasticity. He's searching for the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will make him the King of all Pirates and finally allow him to prove himself to his childhood idol, a selfless pirate by the name of Shanks. Along the way, he collects an army of somewhat freakish rogues, including a tough swordfighter named Zoro who fights with a sword in his mouth, and Nami, a spunky thief. Together they have wacky adventures, beat up the bad guys, and collect treasure. It all sounds pretty harmless, right? 
 
Well, right, it is. One Piece is completely harmless entertainment. The battles can be surprisingly brutal at times, but overall, this is pure shonen action entertainment. It is entirely unpretentious and knows exactly what it wants to be, and excels at that. That having been said, One Piece is not a particularly deep show, although the characters are well developed. The focus seems to be on the crazy villains and the endless string of fights the main characters go through. Luffy and his crew of misfits go from town to town, saving the repressed masses and eliminating evil pirates who stand between them and the One Piece. In some ways, it's very reminiscent of Rurouni Kenshin. Kenshin and Luffy are both laid-back badasses with hearts of gold that surround themselves with surprisingly capable outcasts and defeat circus freak-style enemies in episode after episode. If you like that sort of thing, One Piece delivers. If you don't, One Piece is going to bore the faith out of you. 
 
So, for fans of formulaic action shows, One Piece is a well-animated bit of fluff that sports decent music and some well-done action scenes. Unfortunately, the bizarre character designs are sure to turn a lot of folks off. One Piece is not done in a traditional anime style. It's very unique and it's bound to rub some people the wrong way. Otherwise, if you like your anime rife with fight scenes that last several episodes, declaratory statements (“Ore wa Kaizokuo ni naru da!” or “I will become the Pirate King!” is Luffy's favorite thing to say...), screwball humor and a touch of originality, One Piece will not fail to please.

    Instead of giving the anime a ten simply because it's One Piece, let's take a step back and look at this anime from an objective stand point. 
 
The characters and the story is amazing and the manga is probably one of my favorites, but wow. Those are the only redeeming qualities about it and all of it comes from the mangaka. 
 
Let's start with the things that make this adaption garbage compared to the manga that cannot be argued.  
 
The pacing. I have no idea when it was, but at about the middle of the pre-timeskip, Toei decided it was a good idea to adapt a chapter an episode leaving some arcs almost completely unwatchable - full of scenes that drag on continuously and fillers that weren't originally in the manga. This is most apparent during the dressrosa arc, which has been a little slow in the manga, but is still pretty good, but is nearly unwatchable because of the pacing issues. 
 
The animation and the art. Do I really have to say anything about this? Anyone who's watched One Piece extensively knows just how garbage it is, but will continue to watch it anyway because it's One Piece (me being one of those people) and that is why Toei will keep doing what they're doing with the anime. http://oen-peice.tumblr.com/ Go through there and tell me that I'm wrong about this. 
 
 
This anime is not a proper adaptation for the manga and the only proper way to experience it is through the manga. It was somewhat good in the beginning, but become nearly unwatchable as you get to the later arcs. 
 
 
There is nothing I can really subjectively complain about except for maybe the lack of death and how subpar the timeskip has been compared to pre-timeskip.

    ""It has 700++ episodes"" 
""This show is for kids"" 
""This show sucks"" 
ETC 
 
*Contains heavy spoiler* 
 
Are what most people who don't watch One Piece would say. This is because they are just simply overwhelmed by the number of episodes. There are also people who claimed to have watch the show but it still sucks, so I asked a simple question what was their impression on Nami's backstory and they were unable to answer which is a solid proof that they didn't even watch more than 25 episodes. Three years ago, I was a hater of this series but after I saw the manga sales list, I was surprised to see that the manga sale is so overwhelming so I decided to start watching it and now I am here. 
 
 
One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy and his companions, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky and Brook travelling the whole world in order to achieve their own dreams. 
 
Story 10/10 
 
The story started with an epic entrance. I have never seen any character enter the scene which such way. At first, it made people think that Coby was the main character because he was heavily focused on, but once Coby discovered a barrel, Luffy just suddenly came out of it while shouting ""that was a nice nap!"", I was stunned because it was hilarious yet a brilliant way for a character to make an appearance. 
 
At first, I thought it might just be a simple adventure, but it managed to capture my attention because different island had different uniqueness! 
Oda is very creative! It's fun to see they are travelling around, discovering mysteries. 
 
Talking about mysteries, One Piece has this ""Void Century"" mysteries which is that 800 years ago, there were a period of 100 years where there were simply no record and the government stopped people from finding the full history. They would go to the point of eliminating every single innocent citizen just because of knowing this history. The only for someone to know the Void Century, one must know how to read Poneglyph. Robin was the last person to be able to read the Poneglyph and she was being chased for 20 years ever since she was an eight year old girl. 
 
One Piece consisted many tearjerking moments. E.g Bellemere's death, Doctor Hiluluk's death, story about Montblanc Cricket, Going Merry's final moment, Ace's death, Whitebeard's death, Corazon's death. 
 
Animation 1/10 
 
Toei is lazy as fuck 
 
Sound 10/10 
 
I don't really care about sound but One Piece has some good OSTs. 
 
Character 10/10 
 
-Character development- 
 
The first character development started with Coby. He was a coward, but after he saw Luffy's determination, Coby fought his own cowardice and tried to achieve his own dream. 
 
The second character development was Zoro. He was not afraid of dying when he faced off the world's strongest swordsman. Zoro later acknowledged that he was a weakling thus he strove on becoming stronger. 
 
The third character development was Usopp. Despite he he himself knew that Kaya knew he was lying, he still lied to Kaya in order for her to relieve her boredom due to Kaya's condition that she couldn't live her life freely, Usopp started lying because of his late mother. He tried to cheer his mother by shouting ""pirates are coming"" because his dad, Yassop was a pirate. 
 
The fourth character development was Nami. It was revealed that her past was so sad. When she was ten, her step mother, Bellemere, was murdered right in front of her eyes. It was due to that Bellemere didn't have any money to pay to the pirates who invaded their hometown. Bellemere, despite having the chance to just say she lived alone in the house, chose to admit that she had daughter because of her believe that she would never say she didn't have a family. This showed that Bellemere rather die than to disowned her stepdaughters. The story didn't end there, Nami, being a genius girl who was able to draw a perfect map despite being a ten year old girl was forced to work for the pirate that killed her mother figure. The pirate wanted her talent. They made a deal that if she can pay him 1 million Beli (1 million Yen = 8135 USD) they would leave the village. For eight years, Nami stored up to 700 K like Arlong's slave. But Arlong betrayed her. 
 
I can go on but these are some proofs to show that One Piece does have lots of character developments. 
 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
 
With a good and entertaining storyline, of course the enjoyment will be there.

    Story 
 
For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. 
Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. 
Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. 
This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? 
The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. 
With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. 
With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. 
 
 
Animation 
 
Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. 
The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. 
Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. 
 
 
Music 
 
Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. 
Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). 
 
 
Characters 
 
Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. 
The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). 
However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. 
Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. 
My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. 
 
 
Overall 
 
Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time whereOne Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. 
However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.

    Story: 
 
The story is awesome, the best ever made probably. 
Eiichiro Oda (the mangaka) is a genius of all geniuses, he come up with all this awesome stuff and make an amazing story! 
 
Art: 
 
The animation is not very good to begin with, but it is become better afterwards. 
But what could you expect, the first episodes is old!  
But the animation now is amazing, especielly if you use Vegapunks HD HQ version! 
 
Sound: 
 
One Piece have an amazing soundtrack that is working out very nicely with whats happening at the moment it is played. One of the best OST ever if you ask me. 
 
Character: 
 
Can't come up with another show with so good characters as there is in One Piece. They're all amazing, funny and you kind of get to know them yourself. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
The enjoyment is on top everytime you watch a One Piece episode. 
You're sitting there, watching amazing fights, funny crazyness (mostly by Luffy, Usopp and a little from Chopper). You see very good friendship and some touching scenes. On top of this you got amazing animation, soundtrack and the best story ever made. 
 
Overall: 
 
Really don't know what to write here, other than that this show is the best ever made in my opinion. If you think it is a bit too long you should just try some episodes or one of the movies, after that you can't go back and you end up watching all the episodes! Have fun! ;)

    At first I was a bit skeptical to watch this but once I got more and more into the story I just couldn't stop watching. Sure there is a ton of episodes but I find it well worth it to watch it all. The concept behind the whole story is very emotional. I felt every possible emotion the characters portrayed in One Piece. I even laughed so hard and shed a few tears. If One Piece doesn't want to make you go out become a pirate yourself or simply follow your dreams no matter what, then I don't know what will!

    Well I thought it was a good idea for me to wright a review for my favorite anime and seeing as how I am a major fan of it I might over rate it but I will try to control this. :D 
 
Story: The story is about a boy named Monkey D Luffy he wants to become the greatest pirate and claim the title King of The Pirates. Now I will be honist here the first couple of episodes are not nearly as good as they are now, but hey he gets better soon. The story dosent pick up till Luffy gets four other crew members and the Fifth story arc (they are short atfirst). The fifth story is what made me love Op it has everything a person could want, humor, action, plot, emotion. Then after this point in the series it just gets better and is why it is one of the top anime/manga\'s of this day and age. 
 
Animation: The animation is a little differnt. I guess you could say it kinda looks like its a cartoon/anime and the characters can look kinda goofy sometimes but it does fit the setting of the show. I gave it a 8 even though I love how it looks. 
 
Sound: OMG some of the best music ever it is amazing. The sound tracks to OP is outstanding, that is the only way to describe it. (why they took it out of the english version and replaced it with rap still makes me wonder) 
 
Enjoyment: There is only a few other things that I enjoy more that watching OP. Including every above plus it has very good movies and fillers. I will actualy watch One Piece\'s fillers and enjoy them, thats how good they are. 
 
Overall: I would say check out this anime no matter what.

    As Hayao Miyazaki said, ""characters who never change are not interesting."" 
 
One Piece since the beginning of the timeskip has been a good example of that. 
 
For a while it was a flawed but phenomenal adventure that delighted partially by being unpredictable, while building dramatic momentum, the bonds of friendship, crafting a beautiful paradox of dark and goofy in its universe and making it credible enough that a five -year old minded spoiled brat would be capable of becoming the king of the high seas. 
 
Luffy is kind of the Tom Cruise of anime characters.  He is small but he seems bigger because he is capable of specatular stunts, he has a trememnous s**t eating grin which was cute (for a while) and he is a little naive. And he has a great crew. They are the kind of characters you fall in love with, but falling in love is always a superficial experience. When you stand back you realize that they are all stereotypes;  the coward, the alcoholic, the womanizer, the hunk, the perverted grandpa. The only character that resembles a real human being is Robin, who is so silently compelling that she should have been the start of the series. 
 
The crew go their separate ways for two years after about 500 episodes. Luffy hides away on an Island to train with a sensei in the art of Haki,  much like Luke learns the force from yoda.  Unfortunately he gains all of the action figure benefits of the training but none of the wisdom. 
 
Right from the moment Luffy reunites with his crew, not as a commanding captain, but like a little brother who is seeing his older brothers and sisters, the ship called ONE PIECE was sinking. 
 
The universe has gotten too big for Luffy to NOT grow up.  His immature tendencies are no longer entertaining. Rather than make him a character, Oda is content to leave him as a formula: he is tacky during funny scenes and aggressive and supposedly sincere during action scenes.  That sincerity feels phoney now, simply because it is not in the nature of the person that Luffy is.  It is as phoney as Donald Trump's ridiculous promises to America, painting an illusion of a utopia.   
 
A show about a candidate for a pirate king needs a strong character for a protagonist, not a sketch of a kid. Now this wouldn't be a problem if the show were purely comedy, but no it also want to be a heavy drama at times too, and Oda's ambitions have gone beyond his ability to write them well.  As a drama, The tonal shifts are so inconsistent. Sometimes it is played as farce, and sometimes it is played more sincerely.  More often than not though, the darker subplots involving themes like genocide are done very two dimensionally, and they tend to serve messages that are very glib and lead to backwards minded sequences. Robin (for example) is an adult from a dramatic  world who becomes a disney-derivative damsel in distress at one point, and her prince charming are kids from a comedic one.   
 
This is just one of many examples of Oda destroying the integrity of his characters by being too condescending of them.  He makes the mistake of thinking that in order to make a character sympathetic he has to make them seem childlike in innocence. such is the case with characters like Luffy's brother Ace, who goes from a bad ass to a crybaby.  Indeed some of Oda's philosophy is a complete insult to our intelligence, No subtly at all, and the emotional scenes are always breastfed to us. 
 
The Devil fruit concept was cute at first, but now it's just silly, like an idea stolen from a video game. There are too many fruits, yielding too many powers and likewise, there are too many characters in the universe. Some of them, in fact most of them have become far more interesting than Luffy, and his pals at this point.  Since the timeskip, the Strawhat pirates have become increasingly less compelling and intimidating, and are now a bunch of pansies in silly costumes. We don't really see an increase in their straight because the antagonists are always two steps ahead of them in strength, when they should be more like 1 step ahead. As a result the fights all feel like recycled sequences. 
 
One Piece is a show that has gone on too long and yet disputed the distance we have travelled, it feels like we have gone nowhere.

    Skip it:  
 
The show is extremely overrated & overhyped. Then why is it praised? Well It has a cool starting concept. The story focuses on the world of pirates centering around one man, Monkey D. Luffy, & his journey to become King of all pirates. The former Pirate King, Gol D. Roger before executed publicly by the world government told everyone the greatest treasure the, “One Piece”, is in blue sea for grabs. This ignited the great age of pirates who fought to find it.  
 
The series is divided into arcs, each featuring its stories, islands, which Luffy and company visit for a ""different"" adventure to take place. In reality, it's the same circumstances happening as nothing significant happens to any character, finding the one piece, or to the goal of Luffy becoming pirate king.  
 
Interestingly enough, Luffy & crew do not behave like pirates. In fact, they are helpful, compassionate, & considerate everywhere they go. They seem to behave more like the police if anything. So, why do they want to be associated as criminals if they do not act like it?  
 
The crew doesn't have significant growth. People die & shortly after they all go back into their programed selves. If the goal is for Luffy to become pirate king why isn’t he somewhat close by episode 700? A king should be rational, level headed, tactful, responsible, smart, etc. Luffy is not close to anything. I’ll say he’s emotionally charismatic, strong, & kind, but that is not enough to become a ruler over deranged pirate criminals. 
 
The art for this show is one of the worst showcased. The leads occasionally look decent. However, others are designed hideous. It was painful to observe. Although, the art looked OK in earlier seasons the more it progressed the more nightmarish it got.  
 
There is constant repetition. What I mean is in episodes 293 to 300 it’ll be the same location, dialogue, & situation as from episode 180 to 199. Why are they in the same place with familiar shots? How is this exciting?  
 
The writing is passable for a few melodramatic moments and the sense of humor is sometimes above average. However, overall its a boring program. Whenever Luffy & crew hit a “new” place its the same as before: 
 
1) Luffy and company visit an unknown land. 
2) Meet locals.  
3) Help take out problem(s).  
4) Get praised/&/or new crew mate. 
5) Leave. 
6) Repeat.  
 
Maybe this wouldn’t be a big issue if characters were progressing, the art was pretty, or there was a progression towards the shows conclusion. Sadly, none of it happens so you're left reminded of the boredom & predictability of this tiresome show.  
 
In earlier seasons the backgrounds for characters was done well. However, it goes nowhere so whats the use? The characters don't grow and remain the same. It becomes insulting as you realize the creator constantly manipulates you with sob tactics to make you care. If you took away sad pasts the characters would be nothing. You don't need a sob story to make great characters. You need relatable & inspiring figures who makes mistakes, reflect, grow, & change. Yet that doesn't happen in One piece. 
 
1 : Luffy, remains a moronic, reckless, ignorant idiot who never reflects on anything. Where is the mental maturity? 
2 : Nami, remains a typical basic shonen girl. After her past we never see her working on her goals. It's all brushed away for her to be a cheerleader.  
3 : Zoro, remains an edge lord but at least he still worked at his goal. The only salvageable one. 
4 : Sanji, remains a womanizer who hardly ever discusses his dreams gets beaten, & used for gags. 
5 : Usopp, remains a coward who does off screen training to get muscles. Where is the mental maturity?  
6 : Robin, after her past is legit in the background and used for nothing.  
7 : Franky, fixes ship problems. A plot device to avoid conflicts.  
8 : Chopper, heals team to avoid conflicts.   
 
Luffy is not the worst protagonist but he is wasted. Luffy could have been an educated man by now showing off maturity and growth throughout his adventures. Instead, he is more childish and naïve than ever. One Piece should feel like we’re exploring an ocean, but it feels more like a garden lake.

    Where to begin!?  
One Piece is a very adventurous story. Never in one place for too long the story is full fun and unusual things. 
One Piece is about a rather childish 17 year old boy (Monkey D. Luffy) who aspires to reach his dreams of becoming Pirate King and keeping the promises he's made.  Meeting many a friend along the way the story progresses through many story arcs that build the personality and integrity of each character. 
The first friend and crew member he makes is his ever faithful First Mate (Zoro) who also has a dream to achieve. 
I am not going to explain every character. That would take too long and it would spoil some of the fun. The best way to understand this anime is to watch it. 
One Piece is a really good story, perfect for anyone who likes pirate stories. Though a very long and yet unfinished story thus far, I find it to be very enjoyable. The comedy is some of the best I have seen in any anime. 
I recommend watching in its original japanese with english subtitles (preferably fan-subbed). The dubbed version by 4kids entertainment is TERRIBLE! They have also stopped dubbing it anyway. Funimation has taken over dubbing One Piece in English and has done a far better job. 
As far as fansub groups go, I recommend Kaizoku-Fansubs, Vegapunk and Instantz Noob Production. 
Kaizoku-fansubs (K-F)started subbing the series from the beginning and they are still subbing it today with flying colors. They are the way to go for most of the available episodes. The other groups have what goes after the episodes K-F has done so far. 
Good luck finding and downloading without any problems. Torrent is the easiest way to get them. Otherwise you can get them from IRC. 
This is my favorite anime above all so... 
Enjoy the show!

    The premise is simple enough.  The main character seeks to become the pirate king by finding a treasure called One Piece (you wonder where they come up with these English names ..) and starts by assembling a crew.  The pattern then becomes sailing from island to island, finding problematic villains and sending them packing, gathering crew members, and meeting people.  
 
I had high expectations of One Piece.  As one of the most popular and best-selling manga stories in Japan at the time (and still is) and of the shounen genre that I am fond of, I expected nothing less.  So when Kaizoku-fansubs first started releasing good quality fansubs in 2003 (as compared to the HK rips, where calling the subtitles English is generous), I decided to give the series a shot.   
 
I was disappointed. 
 
As I began watching One Piece, it wasn’t as though I didn’t like the series at all.  It was watchable.  Generally enjoyable.  It just failed to meet the expectations I had.  That was probably the problem.   
 
I continued to watch the series on and off, with the early main characters (Luffy and Zoro) growing on me slowly, and Usopp knocking down my interest a bit.  I started warming up to the series during Sanji’s arc.  Finally, Nami’s arc sealed the deal.  For those familiar with her arc, which I still feel is the best of the crew’s back stories, I can say there were multiple, very memorable moments.  The feelings were real.  I cried for the first time while watching this series.  I cared very much for the characters, and for what happened to them.  I went from lukewarm to obsessed about One Piece. 
 
Its been over 5 years since then, and I still consider One Piece to be one of my favorite stories, both the manga and anime adaptations.  I think One Piece achieves something very rare in its genre.  This isn’t something that I felt all along, but as I’ve examined why I continue to love One Piece, it’s a theory that I think helps to explain it.  Shounen series in general place a heavy emphasis on fighting.  It defines the genre.  Of course, there are reasons the characters fight, and those reasons can often result in long expositions and flashbacks (in the middle of fights, unfortunately).  One Piece is no different.  How One Piece is different is that the fighting is truly a means to an end, not because you know it should be, but because it really is (with many other series, the fighting is usually why we’re watching, whatever else the story might say).  Often, the aftermath and outcomes of the fights are far more rewarding and what one looks forward to, rather than the fights themselves.  A subtle difference, but it makes all the difference in setting One Piece apart from most shounen series. 
 
One Piece is at its most heartwarming in the aftermath of the battles, and in exploring its characters.  It is most enjoyable when it focuses on the antics of the characters as they explore the places they go and generally get themselves into situations.  The interactions between the crew members have spawned tons of hilarious exchanges and scenarios, many which are simply priceless.  One Piece’s main characters, the Straw Hat pirates, are molded after common cliches, yet, as with better stories, make those cliches their own and find a way to be quirkier.  The characters, one and all, can be unabashedly silly yet transition convincingly to deadly serious.  No transition is greater than with Luffy, the main character.  Although he appears goofy and simple, his attitude is better described as fun-loving and child-like, with an innate fascination of the world, new things, and exploration.  He isn’t dumb; rather he ignores typical adult concerns and conventions because they just don’t interest him.  Yet we understand what matters to him.  So when those things are threatened, his seriousness is wholly believable, even if it’s in direct contrast with his usual demeanor.  And when he is serious, he can only be described as incredibly cool ^_^  
 
Remarkably, One Piece manages to balance a genuine lightheartedness through its humor and exuberance, with the gravity of the battles and hardships.  That lightheartedness is missing from most shounen series.  Other series have humor but there is joy in One Piece, which is apparently more difficult to create.  Not to say that this necessarily makes a good story, but it is unique and I’ve seldom encountered other shounen series that exude the same fun and silliness, even as it packs on fights, special powers, and bigger and badder enemies.  
 
I should note that One Piece lacks some of what I consider to be vital elements of a good story, most notably character development and growth, and real tension (i.e., death is possible).  I’ll skip the last, since most series aren’t going to kill off their main characters, but I've not missed the other things, yet.  First and foremost, One Piece is a lot of fun.  It's a story that inspires imagination, and a desire to explore and see new things.  It consistently makes me smile.  And while real tension may be lacking, it doesn't lack for touching or heartbreaking storylines.  One Piece is an amazing ride.  Not for everyone, perhaps, but if themes of friendship, dreams, and exploration, wrapped in a fun package not afraid to be silly, with a healthy dash of fighting, appeals to you, what are you waiting for?

    One Piece, is truly one of my favourite Anime and Manga. Although, in the beggining it took me some time to warm up to it. 
 
Story 
The first part of the series begins by introducing each character as they join the main crew. It didn't really seem that interesting to me at first, but since a friend of mine was watching it with me I decided to continue it. After the beggining of the Arabasta Arc I began to love the series more and more after every Arc. The mixture of Action, Adventure, Comedy, Politics are all given in a smooth and enjoyable pace. Also, the story gives the viewers some important messages concerning friendship and how people should not give up on what they believe. 
 
Art 
The art is really good for a long running series, especially after the High Definition enhancement. It might seem pretty different in the beginning after adapting from Oda Eiichiro-san's art from the manga. I'm not saying it's perfect but it truly is interesting. 
 
Sound 
The Openings and Endings used in the show can sometimes become addictive, you might find yourself in the middle of the road humming the new Opening theme (At least I do some times :P). The background music is also fitting for the series adding some new tracks in later episodes but I don't think they're anything special. 
 
Characters 
The one thing that makes One Piece one of the top series are the characters. Each and every one of them has a different personality both funny and serious and all with a tearjerking past. Furthermore, all of them get equal attention and spotlight. 
 
Enjoyment 
As I said before, the more I continue the series the more I enjoy it. It's really continuing on at a good pace, exploring different genres (e.x. The Thriller Bark Arc)  
 
Overall, 
One Piece has been entertaining from every aspect. From it's hilarious comedy to it's Epic battles. If you have time or are interested in watching a long running series (and I'm sure it has a lot more to go) them don't hesitate to begin watching One Piece, you won't regret it!!

    ''I'm Luffy! The Man Who Will Become The Pirate King'' 
 
This is the quote, that sets the main plotline for the series. Along with the name of the title itself. Hearing this and glimpsing at the synopsis, I build up expectations of an amazing journey, coupled with an engaging story driven narrative and good sense of mystery. Unfortunately those expectations were not met with great content to satisfy them. My main motivations for starting this was my desire to understand why is this series so successful in Japan. And I'm afraid to say after I gave the show a shot, I wasn't able to get it, or even see the appeal like I would for others shows that I didn't like. 
 
Let's start with the Characters [3/10]. They might be one of my biggest gripe of the show. I could forgive the semi-episodic narrative of the show and the repetition found in the format of the arcs if the characters kept my interest and made me want to keep watching. It's not that I simply didn't like them, because Luffy the protagonist himself is pretty likeable, and I like Zoro and Robin. But characterization, progression and just the general writing of the characters fails to deliver. Luffy is two dimensional at best. Everything about him feels borrowed from Goku, and not much is exclusive to him. He doesn't have any significant character development for more than 100+ episodes. He has the same track mind, same point of view. Never changing or maturing. Not feeling any more sense of responsibility and not gasping a bigger sense of the world, emphasizing his naivety and immature personality. So he is a static character for a big portion of the show. While static doesn't mean a bad character by default, in the case of Luffy it makes him a bad character. It makes him super predictable in how he reacts to things, his interactions with others and his decisions in general. There is hardly any fleshing out of his character outside of simple dialogue and simple motives ''I want to be the pirate king'' '' I Will Protect my Nakama'' ''I love meat''. His characterization is very simple and while that could be considered likeable, it's yet not charming as Goku. Since it's just a copy. I just find him dull and non-simulating, the shouting and care free personality with the serious personality in fights doesn't make him interesting to me. There is just no particular depth in his characterization or the execution of his character. He is faced with a major life changing events later on in the series, but he is still the same character after it passes. When speaking of development, it's not meant to be a complete change of personality (180 personality change) but it means a significant change in characterization, while his fundamental character is still intact. A dynamic character most often than not is more interesting with more room to show more layers of the character. 
 
The other main characters more or less are the same as Luffy just slightly better. I found Nami's character to be good due to her conflict with pirates and her character development and back story in Arlong park. I thought that was a not so average aspect like most other things, and I even started liking her. But as soon as that arc finished she remains static with nothing to offer, making her interactions with the crew members predictable, annoying and hardly funny. I expected to see more to her than simple gags. They don't get development past their introductory arcs. Which makes them less believable and interesting, considering they are on a big journey that should alter their lives forever. Repeating of their dreams and motives every other time kinda makes them shallow, because they offer nothing else in conflicts, internal struggles or different dimensions or something subtle to make me wonder and try to think and understand something deeper or anything interesting really. They remain in a status quo for a very long time. The author just doesn't try and bring fourth interesting conflicts for them to develop alongside the story. It's like after he is done with their basic and initial characterization he just stops there. So they feel like very incomplete characters that have unharvested potential despite the length of the series. 
 
I really dislike Sanji. He is the worst crew member. No. He is the worst character in the entire show. No. He is the worst character I've ever seen in any shounen anime. There is bad, and there is offensively bad. Sanji belongs to the latter. His characterization, I don't exactly get what the author wanted here. Did he really want him to be a celebration of sexism? it's supposed to be chivalry but it goes beyond that, and enters the realm of sexism with Sanji. When he refuses to fights female characters even if the lives of his crew members depends on it. He is not supposed to be a comic relief character, so this isn't an excuse to how his character is written and presented. I don't see him as a classy womanizer, I see him as an offensive character who's love for women shouldn't be more than a comedic side to him. It shouldn't be a big part of his characterization. It came to the point where his comedic nose bleed became an actual plot point, I shit you not. It's like everything about him aside form his initial dream (that is never brought up as an actual point of relevance after his arc) is about women. And that's why he is that much worse than the other characters in the show. There is nothing redeeming about him (even his style of fighting is bleh) 
 
The story [5/10]. I didn't see something particular impressive about it. There are certain problems that is apparent in almost every arc. They are formulaic for the most part. The crew goes from an island to an island helping the inhabitants of said islands, and go on about their way. It feels like every arc is episodic and discontinued, with little things barely connecting them together to an overarching story. I didn't like that since I like continuity and for a premise such as this, I was more in favor of non-episodic storytelling. As it feels like padding, since you get introduced to a lot of characters that are in the end not important or even relevant outside of their perspective arc for the story or the main characters. Once in a while one of those characters make a surprise appearance and the fans get excited, feels a bit like tricking them from my point of view, especially with the characters that are supposed to be dead but are never shown exactly their death. 
 
The type of stories in each of these arc is more or less fundamentally the same. An evil oppressor (Arlong, Crocodile) does his evil ways in the island and controls it for his own objectives. The heroes (strawhat crews) became friendly and bond with the villagers, so they are asked to help them. Luffy takes on the big bad and the others take care of the henchmen. This type of scenario gets boring pretty fast. Especially when it in itself, without the repetition is dreadful and the bare bones of a hero vs villain narrative. In Alabasta, it almost feels like a Disney story, with the person asking for help being a princess. Villains in the series in general are evilly cartoon-ish. Another issue is the plot armor, and how almost nobody dies. 700 episodes and the death of important characters can be counted in one hand. Nothing wrong with keeping it light, but if that's the the intention then the characters shouldn't be facing that many near death experience and surviving through cartoon logic. It will really test your suspension of disbelief. Luffy for whatever reason almost always has to take the big bad of any arc, which adds to the formulaic nature of the arcs. There no logic behind it aside from Luffy being the protagonist. This negates the potential for more interesting conflicts or the chance for other crew members to get a bigger spotlight. Zoro's spotlight in Thriller Part is a fine example of how Luffy not hogging the spotlight for once was incredibly refreshing and most importantly great on it's own. 
 
The pacing [2/10]. This in particular is one of the biggest issues in the series. That overwhelming amount of episodes isn't like that just because of the great mass of content alone, but the almost snail pacing contributes to that greatly. Toei is the animation studio in charge of this adaption. It became infamous for this type of pacing and production. Intro in the beginning of each episode, recaps, a lot of paused shots, and overall just the mind numbing feeling that nothing of interest is happening for several minutes of an episode. This is definitely the biggest hindrance of enjoyment in the show, at least for me. But it's not all Toei's fault. The original source material also has a slow progression of events. Along with Toei's treatment, this makes for an unsatisfying watching experience. Which is one of the main reasons if not the biggest reason why I dropped the series above all else. Take in mind, that this isn't to say slow pacing is inherently bad, it actually can enhance the experience of certain works. But One Piece is definitely not one of those works. A balance would have been ideal, even if I have preferences for fast pacing in action shows. It's currently according to a lot of people unbearable, so it only gets worse. 
 
The action component of the series is, in my opinion just awful [3/10]. I personally consider the fights in One Piece to be the worst I've seen in any action shounen I've watched. Be it in terms of creativity, strategy, abilities/powers, excitement or animation. The abilities/powers are silly, while that works with the general style of the show, its still lacks creativity, as they feel like they are created by a child. A rubber man. Someone that can make anything into a door. Feet that generate fire from the passion of the heart, etc. I will get to the animation in it's own paragraph. The fights are sometimes really dumb, and are mostly devoid of strategy. The best you can get in terms of strategy, is juvenile tricks by Ussopp, and the silly 'tactics' Luffy comes up with, that shouldn't work but they do because of Luck or/and the incompetence of the villains (the classic trite of you are beneath me so I didn't take you seriously and was careless) . Shouting and straight forward predictable fighting, is what you will get. The tension created by how is this character going to best this character is simply not there. When Zoro gets beaten up badly by someone made of steel, but suddenly has the resolve and wants to believe he can cut steel, and he just does with no good explanations, you will know that you shouldn't expected anything smart out of the fights. In fact some are offensively dumb, Bon clay vs Sanji comes to mind. There is also how the comedy is inserted in some fights or certain scenes. I realize that show has a lot of comedy, and it's a prominent genre, but that doesn't mean it should be inserted whatever. With disregard of the current tone and atmosphere of the scene, a particular scene in thriller park had that. It undermines the importance of the fights sometimes and the mood that is being set, and it in itself is rarely funny. The humor in general is not great. As it's very repetitive and most often dry. How many times until Nami, yelling at the crew and showing her greed becomes just plain unfunny. Though maybe if you really like any particular gag, you will still like seeing it again and again (Zoro's bad sense of direction for example). So it depends on the individual's sense of humor. It wasn't until Alabasta that I found an episode to have legitimately funny scenes, so I came across more misses than hits. 
 
The Art and Animation, and OST [5/10]. I will be frank, I didn't really take much notice to the soundtrack so I can't comment on it. The artstyle of the series is often described as ''ugly'' by those who refuse or avoid to watch it. And I can't say that I blame them. Is the art different compared to similar shows? Yes. Does that automatically makes it better or good? not necessarily. The art is influenced by western cartoons and Disney. And it's fair point for those that think it's works well with the series, and I agree to a certain extent. But that still doesn't mean me or others will like it, as it's still very unappealing. It also has an apparent effect on the emotional scenes in the show. The facial expressions are so exaggerated that it disengaged me from whatever emotional scene I was watching. With big rainy eyes, and noses full of snot. It completely lacks subtlety. Bigger doesn't always mean better. It comes off as the show trying hard to emphasize just how sad what you are watching is. It can be ineffective and worse, counterproductive, when instead of feeling sorry and emotionally involved you feel like laughing because of the ridiculous faces. 
 
While I understand this is a long running anime therefore expecting fluid animation is unfair. It still should mean that at least once in a while you will be presented with good to great animation in important scenes and fights. Like with other long running battle anime. This unfortunately is not the case here. At times it feels like a slideshow. Barely any nice visual effects. Lot of pauses and staring. Still shots. No good Sakuga. And it only gets worse currently according to the fans. 
 
The Worldbuilding [5/10]. I left this at the last, because from my general understanding this is the most praised thing about the show. But why? from my point of view, there is nothing impressive about a city in the dessert or an island in the clouds/sky. Once again the creativity of the author seems child like. But maybe that's the appeal. The feeling of freedom, and childish imaginative without the shackles of reality. But it still doesn't necessarily make it great. It feels like it's praised because he created a vast world that is still expanding because why wouldn't he expand it, when the estimation for the number of chapters is beyond 1000. But then again, worldbuilding wasn't something that I cared for in general, in my favorite shows, or any work of fiction for that matter. I could appreciate well done aesthetics of a beautiful world, that you like to take a mental picture of. That's not the case here, so I can't really credit it. 
 
Ultimately, I truly and honestly wanted to like this. So the gigantic amount of episodes/chapters would become an advantage. I wanted to be immersed in a story and keep following it for years. But the series failed me, after giving it a fair enough chance. I stomached through the beginning since they said Arlong park where it will get good. I endured after that, when they said Skypiea is fun and worth it. I couldn't keep on hoping, when they said it's Water 7 this time, more than 200 episodes. I just gave up. There wasn't any pay off. Everything was standard average to below average, with few exceptions. Not special or distinctive to dislike or for this to become more than a disappointment. My enjoyment being hindered with the pacing, and lack of stimulating characters, I made the natural choice of dropping it. I just couldn't take another minute felt like I will just die from boredom. 
 
TL:DR- If you are hesitant whether or not to make this big time commitment, you should keep in mind that it's generally agreed upon by fans and haters alike that it doesn't get better until Arlong park, which more than 30 episodes into the anime. I would recommend this, if you are looking for a happy go lucky battle shounen, that has a lot of focus on the adventure. I don't recommend this, if you are looking for a continuous narrative of a complex story about finding a treasure, with interesting unique characters. Nothing of value is lost, or something worth the commitment if you are avoiding this.

    Story: 
So let's start with something we can all agree on- visually and conceptually, One Piece is a unique series. Anime is littered with ghost hunters, ninjas and teenagers endowed with mystical powers inspired Eastern mythology, but Oda hit on something special when he came up with the idea of 17th century pirates with superpowers. And that's really the beginning of One Piece's creativity. For such a long series, a constant flow of creativity is a must, and Oda has generally shown that he is up to the challenge. One of the conceits of the series is that each island the characters travel to is a strange world unto itself. One island could be under the thumb of tyrannical mermen, another a mystical island where it always snows, and still another where all the plants and animals have grown to be really l o n g. It's wonderful world building, but not in the sense that it's carefully crafted like Fullmetal Alchemist. It's more like a child's glee at making things up as she goes along. Unlike most shounen series, where superpowers and wonders have some kind of pseudoscientific explanation, the series follows an unrelenting dream logic that it doesn't explore very deeply. Why does eating a fruit that gives you superpowers also mean you can never swim? It just does, dammit. It's a refreshing change, and it keeps the sense of wonder intact for many episodes. 
 
Luffy is a kid who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, and now is a rubber man: literally, a man made of rubber. That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in One Piece, it's a potent power that leads to some crazy, awesome, and crazy awesome fights. He can take a lot of damage, and since his rubber fists and feet can stretch to huge lengths, he can give as good as he takes. One of the main villains, Buggy, ate the Chop Chop Fruit, so he can divide his body however he pleases. And there are many more, and for over three hundred plus episodes, we are constantly introduced to wave after wave of new characters with strange abilities that range from the silly to the sinister, and, sometimes, are even both at the same time. And one of the small delights of the series is that when our heroes get strong by developing their powers, they break from the shounen formula of ""defeat - training - victory."" No, the characters develop their skills on the fly- they make it up as they go along. This burst of creativity lasts so long and is so strong, that when the anime does finally bring back some old characters beyond the core cast, it's a bit of a disappointment. 
 
Characters: 
Of course, for the series to be any kind of success, the characters would have to be better than your garden variety heroes. They'd have to be characters you could care deeply about and watch develop beyond what crazy things their powers do. Luffy can't become the Pirate King by himself, so he brings along a ragtag group of people he befriends in his travels. Though the small crew keeps adding new characters, there's roughly five core members: Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While you could safely describe each of these characters by whatever their particular kook is- Sanji is the cook who loves the ladies, Nami is the domineering navigator who loves money, Zoro is the samurai swordsman who wields three blades and sleeps all the time, Usopp is the sniper who tells outrageous lies- but that doesn't quite do them justice. They develop and grow close to each other, reinforcing the anime's central theme of friendship. The cast is probably One Piece's greatest strength, because when the story lags and things slow down, it's still a pleasure to spend time with the Straw Hats. I would hold them up to any of the great crews of anime, from Lupin, Urusei Yatsura, or Cowboy Bebop. And save a kind word for the villains: after all, what's a good hero without one or a dozen great enemies? They are all hateful bastards who deserve to get their face smashed in. It's a delight to see it happen every time. 
 
Art: 
Visually One Piece is one of the most unique anime out there; one could say that the look of One Piece is very abstract when compared to most other anime of present in the same genre or any genre. this is mainly due to Eiichiro Oda’s art style crafted in the manga which has a very unique and unusual look when compared to other manga. Some people have even put off watching this show purely based on the look of the show which is a darn shame because they are doing themselves a massive disservice. While One Piece isn’t as detailed as other shōnen anime like Fullmetal Alchemist, Naruto or Bleach, which have highly detailed characters in the facial, hair, and clothing areas, One Piece has is simple in composition but has a lot of artistic flair and creative things that you’d never find in other anime. The characters are very simple, not very detailed and look kind of wacky and funky when compared to other shows. However I feel that the look of One Piece‘s characters, creatures, settings and animation are very interesting and is one of the unique selling points of the show and if you give it time you will adjust and come to love it. 
 
Sound: 
The music for this show is totally incredible, its varied, catchy, epic and has a musical theme for every scenario. Each character has a certain theme that’ll play while they’re fighting or doing something sneaky and the songs work very well. Another great aspect with One Piece‘s soundtrack is that the music evolves along with the show with different themes for new locations, characters or fighting music for new situations and it really shows that the show is changing and it really immerses you in that world too. Eventually you’ll find yourself humming away with some songs, whether they are opening songs or particular tunes in the show’s soundtrack. 
 
Overall Enjoyment: 
I believe that One Piece is the definition of what shōnen-based anime is all about. Now One Piece is a shōnen by genre which normally means that one is dealing with an action/adventure-based cartoon. The codes and conventions found in this anime are similar to other shōnen anime like Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach and Fairy Tail. You have the main protagonist who is a man, accompanied by other main characters who are either friends, allies or enemies. The main cast of protagonists are normally in a group or crew of some kind travelling from place to place of varying look and feel, coming across different obstacles and overcoming them through meeting their problems head-on and fighting their way to victory. And obviously as the journeys continue the obstacles become harder to triumph over. But I believe the way that One Piece does it is just wonderful, subtle and done with a great deal of style that it stands out from any other anime.

    This self proclaimed ""anime"" IS the worst thing to come out of japan since the kamikaze in WW2! 
 
I'll tell you why. 
 
#1 It starts off with a story, and a goal but quickly it forgets these things and goes out of control with endless fillers. 
#2 ENDLESS FILLERS!! it's as if they can't seem to escape from them. 
#3 The art is so horrible i can't stand to look at it, when the main characters smile i almost throw up. 
#4 The sound of luffy's voice is painful, and that is a understatement. 
#5 It's a slap in the face to all REAL pirates fictional or real. 
#6 There milking this show for all the money they can, it's not about the show anymore it's about the money. 
#7 I never hear the end of these 13 year olds asking why the newest episode is not already translated and uploaded the moment the day switches over! 
#8 The 13 year old fans never shut up about how ""awsome"" this show is! 
 
In the end the voice acting makes my ears bleed, the art makes me puke, and the story has been long forgotten during this endless maze of fillers and milking! 
 
I know I will get nothing but flack but at the end of the day this is my opinion I'm not forcing it on you so PLEASE don't try and change my mind on it. i watched 40 episodes JUST to have the right to say ""I tried, i really REALLY tried! But I hate it""

    One of the best anime i have ever seen, at points its not as interesting as other anime, but over all it is amazing.  
 
 
One Piece is an anime about pirates and dreams.. but mostly about dreams.  
 
Monkey D Luffy is a character that everyone has to love, he\'s the captain with the strongest dream and love of his crew, but he doesn\'t really act like a captain at all, instead of ordering everyone around, he\'s always just trying to have fun. He loves food, but expecially meat, its supprising how much he can eat. (WATCH THE ANIME!) He can stretch because he is made of rubber and  his dream is to become the Pirate King. 
 
Roronoa Zoro is the firstmate and swordsman, he always carries around his 3 katana and he seems to care more about them than people. He loves his sake and has a good drink when ever possible, but like a true pirate, he never gets drunk. His dream is to become the best swordsman ever. 
 
Usopp is a sharpshooter and total liar. He often calls himself the captain. Can\'t really think of much to say that makes sense if you havnt watched the anime. His dream is to become a true man of the sea. 
 
Nami is the navigator who will suddenly change course for money. She takes control of the ship when Luffy is negleting his job and tells them to get a move on. Without Nami, everyone would be always arguing and they wouldn\'t be going anywhere (until Luffy grew up and started acting like a captain). Her dream is to draw a map of the world. 
 
Sanji is the cook. But watch out if you are a girl because he\'ll soon be running after you. He always runs after girls when he\'s not busy (generally, but he sometimes does when he is..). He cooks the best food around and is always inproving, but he favouratises the girls when he\'s cooking and gives them the nicest things. His dream is to find All Blue, (WATCH THE ANIME!). 
 
Tony Tony Chopper is the doctor, he\'s a reindeer who joins the crew. He can become a human, but he always keeps his blue nose. He\'s a really good doctor and a funny and cute character. (WATCH THE ANIME!) 
 
Finnally, Robin, She\'s an archieologist who used to be their enemy. When Luffy saved her when she just wanted to die and had nothing to live for, she joined the crew. Recently, something strange happened to them (WATCH THE ANIME!). She wants to find the rio poneglyph. (WATCH THE ANIME!) 
 
It is a very long series and no one wants it to end any time soon. It never gets boring and the characters are all perfectly made.

    Okay, this is a LONG series, so it's kinda hard to review it as a whole because I feel completely differently at different points of the series. So I'll break it up into three sections 
 
My overall score is based on the last section though.  
 
First Section [Episodes 1 - 223] 
 
I'd call this a pretty fun anime almost out of the gate. It was really exciting seeing a very unique world, unique premise and interesting characters to wonder about right away. I really enjoyed that a lot of characters were introduced very early on as very powerful people, but we were totally left to wonder about them. This is very essential to getting people excited about what's to come.  
 
As far as the characters go, although they are all pretty one dimensional, they are all very likeable (except for Usopp, I can't stand him). Luffy is kinda hard to hate and there is someone to like for everyone in the series.  
 
The story definitely drags a bit. Lot's of filler and pointless sub-plots that drag on for several episodes, but still pretty enjoyable. The main plot continued to thicken and it definitely was alive enough to keep me watching.  
 
 
Second Section [Episodes 223 - 516] 
 
I'd say this is definitely the best section in the anime. This is essentially the build up to the Whitebeard arc, but not before going to Water Seven and really spicing up the story with new, powerful characters and big character development between Luffy's crewmates.  
 
Water Seven was good, but the chapter after that was a bit dull. Kinda just waiting for what eventually became the Whitebeard arc. Once that started, I was at the edge of my seat watching it all the way through.  It does go on and on and on, but you finally get to see some badass characters fight and Luffy really stepping up in power quite a bit.  
 
Very fun watch, even though some episodes are worth skipping. I very much liked this anime up until this point.  
 
Third Section [Episodes 516 - 677 (ongoing)] 
 
Here is where I really started to fall off. At first it wasn't so bad, but I progressively realized that I wasn't looking forward to anything in this anime, and as soon as I caught up with the release cycle and was watching weekly since about episode 590, I realized that nothing was happening on an episode to episode basis and as it kept going, even less would happen in each episode.  
 
The last 20 episodes has been some of the worst. Every week I watch it for whatever reason, and every week I realize that I would have missed absolutely nothing if the whole episode was turned into a recap clip.  
 
Episodes don't really begin until about 4 minutes and 30 seconds in, and even then, it's essentially rehashing the last 5 minutes of the episode before that. They spend FAR too much screen time with reaction shots, sound effects and a bunch of shit that doesn't matter and very little with progressing the story line. I don't think there has been an episode in a while that would take more than 3-4 sentences to describe literally everything that happened.  
 
[Overall / Story / World] 
 
I do like the premise of the power system in One Piece. It's a pretty simple idea and pretty flexible. You obviously have to dismiss some stuff that simply don't make sense, but you fine with it... at least at the start of the story. Later on though, you quickly realize how unpolished the power system is. You have literally no balance at all. Bad guys will crazy OP powers can seemingly never exhaust their power, but Luffy is tired almost immediately after he starts a long fight. And as they add more concepts into the system, the more you think to yourself, why did we never see this before if everyone can fucking do it?  
 
They are all traveling the grand line, but seemingly every other pirate is waiting just ahead of Luffy waiting for him to catch up. Even with a 2 year gap, pirates haven't progressed at all down the grand line while it only took Luffy 1 year to travel the first half.  
 
The story just starts to break with time and characters are becoming progressively less interesting... However, it could be improve a lot if I didn't feel like I was wasting my time watching each episode because nothing fucking happens. (and yes, I'm including even episode 677. Doesn't justify the previous 20 being about a bunch of nothing).

    Well where do i start ... there is so much to say.. for the super fans of One Piece, i'm going to punish this anime so this review may piss you off.  
 
 
This anime, like any other big shonen, made a crucial mistake that i'm going to explore, besides that, the rest is fine.  
 
Story: 7/10. Well.. it is hard to explain this rate. Is the plot original and creative? Yes it is, but it does not sound nice ! It seems like they started with a decent plot, and then they just keep adding things to make it bigger. I mean, the plot doesn´t need to be 'stupid'. I don´t mind if there is unicorns or mermaids or even islands in the sky but keep adding things will not make the plot better. But this is not the main reason for this rate ..  
 
The story takes to much time to be developed.. I mean we have arcs with 60 eps or even more.. i've seen animes with 24 with more content than these arcs with 60 or more eps ..  the pace is just to damn slow which makes the anime boring at some point.  
 
Plus, we can have one hundred different islands, each one with something different, if the story is always the same, it won´t make us hooked. Because yes it's always the same, we have a bad powerfull guy that took control of the island, and the weak good guys asked for Luffy's help and that's basically the entire anime is all about ... and ofc Luffy will always win. If the plot is always the same thing throughout 700 eps, there is no way for it to be good !  
 
Besides all of those bad points, there is a good point.. the ""Akuma no mi"", those fruits that grants them powers are really nice. We have so many different powers and we always want to know which power the bad guy has. Because we never know, there are so many..  
 
Art: 7/10. The anime starts with a crappy art, but then gets better with the time but never reached great levels ... the action sometimes has no detail. Some special movements or attacks we can´t even see them (especially when is about swordsman .. i mean they use their special movement, but we don´t see him actually using it, we just see the enemy being hit.. and that just sucks). The background is reasonable at least so as the character design.  
 
Sound: 8/10. Nice openings .. all of them portray the happy theme that One Piece talks about (friendship). The OSTs are reasonable enough to make the action and the drama good.  
 
Character: 8/10. For me, the best point here. We have nice characters with a nice development and a nice past (actually when they were telling the past of some character, i nearly cried at some, because they were dramatic enough to make me care a lot.) BUT .. it's like watching the same character every single time. All of them can be resumed to this sentence: ""I care about my friends so i'm going to protect them at any cost"" .. basically they look like this..  
 
About the villians .. we have some nice villians actually .. they make us hate them, so when they get defeated we feel relieved xD but they are also the same shit. The motivations are always the SAME (take control of something, usually the island). So .. we don´t have that variety of characters that we see in other animes .. It's basically the good guys vs the bad guys ..  
 
Enjoyment: 7/10. This anime starts being good as hell, with nice fights and nice development but .. it was good because it was new for me. When i was in the 500th ep or so i was like ""yh yh let's move on to the fights instead i don´t care about your story !!!"" .. and there is even some arcs that were painfull to watch ..  
 
Overall : 6/10.. this anime is just too big .. it has nice characters, nice development and even a interesting plot .. but not for 700 eps .. if you are looking for some nice action anime, or even some nice shonen .. well you can watch this one, at least the first few arcs because those are good but i think it doesn´t worth, if you are like me, when you start something and then you have to end it, well don´t touch in this anime. Because you will get bored.. it's just to damn long. Furthermore, it gets repetitive so i don´t see the point in watching this.

    [Spoiler Warning] 
 
ok. let's start with the art. the art is a 7. it's pretty good art and after a little while you'll get used to how the of all the special abilities look. 
 
Sound is once again a 7 there is nothing really to complain to much about the sound. typical for shounen anime really. dramatic music at dramatic moments happy music happy moments, you know the obvious. it's kind of hard to fuck up sound. 
 
Characters are a 7, they have nice drive. which i think is important for shounen anime cuz they tend to be battle manga and you can't have the characters the weakest cuz they will never fulfill their drams. 
 
Enjoyment is a solid 7. it's always fun to watch the good guys kick the bad guys ass or whoever is in their way for some bullshit reason. plus when you love the characters the enjoyment is also good. 
 
Sadly this is where everything else takes a nosedive into a volcano and incinerates itself. the story and overall are both a 1. now this might not make sense considering how the other parts of the show went but because I'm not a fanboy that orgasms at hearing the name of the show you will get an honest and objective viewpoint. the reason the story is crap is because they have done NOTHING in the goal of making Luffy the pirate king. In my opinion there are big milestones in the story. in order they are 1 Luffy gathering his entire crew. 2 (SPOILER ALERT) the death of his brother Ace. and finally 3 (SPOILER ALERT FROM MANGA) Luffy discovering one of his childhood friends Sabo is alive when believed dead.(END SPOILER) Yes these are good story points but these three segments are they only things related to him being a pirate besides the obvious like him beating strong people and his bounty rising yada yada. but what about him being the pirate king? Nope. About the meaning behind the initial D.? Nope. Oh wait what about the true history of the world written in the Poneglyph's that Nico Robin is looking for? Thats gotta be mentioned more then just a few times and be a serious story arc to help get closer to a proper ending? NOPE. Every time they  have major story points like the 3 I had just now and the others I'm probably forgetting what happens? They mention it a few times in the story make a big deal out of it then sweep it under the rug. the author is just milking the manga for profit at this point and i don't see anything in the story moving farther towards an ending. which is kind of the entire point of watching and or reading the damn thing. you wanna see the entire journey, beginning to END. NOT watch someone earn their fat paycheck. that is why the show is crap. that is why i dropped it.

    One Piece starts great. It has original setting for its time, it introduces the best hook in all shounen anime, important characters are nicely fleshed out, the main character cannot one punch every enemy, and the story doesn’t feel like the original creator has run out of ideas. But this was many years ago. It doesn't look like an anime worth watching in 2017. 
 
Since One Piece was first published in 1997 as a manga, and was animated in 1999, it took decades to tell the story. Its creator Eiichiro Oda had just graduated from high school back in the 1990s. He kept writing the same story well into his middle ages. I grew old watching and reading One Piece. I sometimes wonder how many fans have died waiting for the story to end. Please, if you ever create a story do end it before your youngest readers get their menopause or other age-related changes. Fans aren’t immortals to indulge storytellers. Even Eiichiro Oda is taking more and more breaks to take care of his health. Otherwise he cannot continue the work.  
 
One Piece has one unique element that is hard to find in other long-airing anime. Its story is solid. It has actually two different storylines which Oda skillfully combines into a single plot. The first is the story of Straw Hat Pirates led by Luffy. The second is the history of the world of One Piece. As Straw Hat pirates continue their adventures they also discover the truth about their world.  The pirate king who died decades ago left a great treasure called One Piece which somehow can change the fate of the world. The world government fights against pirates who want to become the next pirate king by finding that incredible treasure. As you can see, the lives of individual characters are more or less related to the world’s history. It makes the story more realistic. More, these two parallel storylines in a single plot make the anime even more interesting when they meet. This double-storyline method makes it possible for the lives of different characters to be intertwined naturally. 
 
In One Piece supporting characters have lives of their own. Every character is also part of the world depicted. They don’t feel like talking heads in the void. Their lives are not isolated from each other. 
 
Because the history of the world is so vast, there’s always something going on behind the stage. Actions of important people belonging to the world of One Piece have crucial importance. They can change the fate of the world. Furthermore, the aftermath of crucial battles does have repercussions for others as well. By careful storytelling Eiichiro Oda succeeds in preventing the main character from becoming an undisputed god in power. Another feature of this method is that there is actually more organic tragedy in One Piece. 
Overall, One Piece stands out for its original storytelling for shounen, but sadly, like all long-lasting stories, it got old. Its creator got old. Its fans got old. The world got old.

    One Piece is definitely a must-watch anime series if anyone is looking for an amazing series with tons of character development, an intricate and engrossing story, very emotional moments, character companionship,  some amazing fight scenes, as well as a lot of comedic moments.  This anime has been in the top 10 in Japan for a long time, and for good reason.  Right from the get go, the anime introduces you to Monkey D. Luffy, our protagonist of the anime, as well as a few more of his crew that will be sailing the Grand Line with him.   
 
Each character that ultimately ends up joining the Strawhat pirates all have a big dream that they want to follow, and usually, that is the reason as to why they join to crew.  It's amazing to see how everyone's dream is tied together and Oda has woven it almost flawlessly.  Each character also has their strengths and weaknesses which come into play throughout the entire anime.   
 
If you haven't tried One Piece, I urge you to give this show a try.  If you're not used to its animation, please, don't let that be the sole reason that you don't watch this show.  In time, you'll grow to love the animation, and as the series goes on, the animation just gets better and more crisper than before.

    Oh, I can  tell I am getting my full of Battle Shounens for the day. And maybe for the week. So it's time to put away revisiting Hitman Reborn for a while and review an anime I watched recently. 
 
One Piece...oh boy. This is a difficult one to review. So let me just say this outright. There are two ways to review something. One, you compare it with its peers and see how it stands. And the other you test it on it's own merits. And you are probably going to say, ""Oh test it on it's own merits that is good!"" Well, I tend to do the former because that is the more Capitalistic of the two. Comparing it with it's peers to see whether or not you should take your time and money elsewhere. And in the end, the former fits more with the dictionary definition of a consumer review. 
 
And here's the ""but"". But One Piece's peers are all Battle Shounens, and One Piece is an Action Adventure (Shounen is implied here because  Action Adventure is usually aimed at a younger audience). Now, One Piece is an Action Adventure who is competing with other Battle Shounens...so you see my predicament. How can I compare something to other things outside of its genre? It just doesn't work. And that is just not plain fair.  
 
But I must compare it to it's peers because it is competing with Naruto, and Bleach, and even smaller ones like Medaka Box, and the aforementioned Hitman Reborn. I must also do this because I have not seen any Action Adventure animes, and I can't compare it to stuff I haven't seen! So, I must grade it as if it were a Battle Shounen.

Usually Battle Shounens have bad stories, but this one takes the cake. This is the vaguest plot I have ever seen. And that is because there is no plot. There is no structure. You can look at Naruto and say that there is an overall plot and story line that adds up when you add in all of the arcs. But One Piece doesn't have that. The only plot that is in the show is when the characters are arrive at a new Island. Story: 1/10 
 
Characters: 
 
Now before you stop reading this review and hit the ""Not Helpful"" button out of rage. Or God-forbid begin hate commenting on my profile or even sending me death threats because your favorite animu doesn't have a plot; let me get onto the characters.  
 
The characters in One Piece are surprisingly well written...To an extent. They all have their own goals and their own struggles which make them all grow together as a team. As a character story this anime does fairly well. Most of the arcs are there for the sole purpose of characterizing one of the characters more.  
 
And that is fine, but my question is as follows: Why have none of the characters have had lives outside of seven years old? 
 
Let me explain, whenever a character has a flashback to their past they are always seven years old, or a similar age. What, have they been stuck in the hyperbolic time chamber for their entire lives? I mean seriously all of these characters are in their early to late twenties.... 
 
What? They are in their teens? No way, those ages are arbitrary, there is no way Sanji is nineteen. And Luffy is seventeen. No way, Sanji is obviously in his late twenties. Maybe 28 or 29. But not Nineteen. And Luffy looks like he is 21. Who are they trying to fool? Seriously. And after the timeskip, Sanji looks like he is in his early thirties. I mean, he even has his Italian porno stache going on. 
 
But I am digressing.  
 
I am sure that these characters have had some other life changing conflicts outside of a very young age. I mean, the characters get more substance as they go on, it's just I feel that they could have done their initial characterization differently. Characters: 7/10 
 
Sound: 
 
I have had no problems with the sound, there are no tracks that particularly stood out to me or ones that I just hated. Sound 7/10 
 
Art: 
 
The art is definitely at the beginning of the series a 4/10. But over the years One Piece has gotten with the times and upgraded it's art to a 8/10. So I met it halfway and it is a 6/10.  
 
Length:  
 
This is a special criteria that will be added into the overall score because I feel that this needs to be mentioned. This show is 600+ episodes long. I love my long running series, Dragonball Z and Yu Yu Hakusho come to mind. But those were all 200-300 episodes long. And there is definitely a point where a show gets too long. Yes, Naruto is reaching it's 600th episode as well, if it has not already gotten there (I read the manga). But with Naruto you have the break between the original and Shippuden to break up the monotony.  
 
So, I think that One Piece being as long as it is is detrimental to the series. It makes it intimidating for the newcomers to the series, like me, to get into the show. It's like, ""Well, where do I start?"" And beginning at the beginning is a long and hard road to get through, man. And you can't begin somewhere after the beginning because the characters are consistent in their characterization. It's not like Bleach where events happen and they are never mentioned again. One Piece is consistent to the point where the characters are constantly referring to past events. And after their characters get going, this becomes more frequent later on down the road. The time skip is an example. 
 
So I am going to rate length like this. 10 being the perfect length for the show, like Madoka Magica. And 1 being so long, or so short, that there is no time to tell the story or characterize the characters, think Angel Beats.  
 
So the Length gets a, 4/10. 
 
Fights: 
 
After giving length it's own special criteria in this review. I hesitate to add another special criteria. But since a lot of peopl- fanboys talk about the fights and compare it to Bleach; I feel they would not be justified if I don't put this in here.  
 
For the fights I have not seen with getting as far as I did; I have looked up on YouTube and watched. 
 
So, the fights are short. Like, really short. Most of the fights are below 15 minutes with all of the bull edited out. Bull being talking and scene transitioning to see what all of the other characters are doing for a couple of episodes. And this just does not compare when the same thing is done to other shows like Dragonball Z where if all of the bull is edited, the fights go on for 2:40:37 straight. Don't believe me?  
 
Citation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB45FE6y_wg 
 
So these are the shortest fights, but length shouldn't really matter, shouldn't it? And it wouldn't matter if the fights were sweet. And they are for the most part. I just wish that some fights were longer, like the fight between Luffy and the ""Door Door"" guy with the bull horns. I forget his name. But unfortunately the fight was wasted because the entire point of it was to show off Luffy's new ability.  
 
And that is not to mention that some of the fights completely break my willing suspension of disbelief. Like the fight between Zoro and Kaku. I can't explain this with words. Just here: 
 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6WtrRogy_w 
 
And the joke is that this is supposed to be taken seriously.  
 
I saw a similar post in the comments. And that person was bombarded with One Piece sales figures to try and justify this. But I noticed that in doing so the One Piece fanboys dodged the question: How can anyone take this seriously? I'm sorry, but I can't. Fights: 3/10 
 
Edit: Oops It appears I forgot the enjoyment criteria, forgive me. Please. 
 
Enjoyment:  
 
Personally I don't like Action Adventure shows. 2/10 
 
 
Overall: 
 
I guess I should end this with a miraculous conclusion that summs up everything and wraps it all up with a nice bow to boot. But I don't have the energy. Overall 6/10. Edited with Enjoyment this makes the Overall score 5.8/10 rounded up is a 6/10...wow.

    Yes, you can believe your eyes, I really rated One Piece a 6. 
But please! Wait before spamming the 'Not Helpful' Button. 
 
I'm myself a fan of Shonen Anime, so I should happen to like One Piece, right? Right?! 
Nope, not really. But let's delve a bit deeper. 
 
Story: 6/10 
The definitely most promising about One Piece is its absolutely unique setting. 
The sheer vastness of the world makes this anime outstanding. And even better, in that kind of setting nearly everything can happen. Adventures on the ship, tropical islands, deserts, or some snowy winter paradise. 
However, despite this promising world, each and every damn arc is exactly the same, over and over again!! Our crew gets to island XYZ. Some evil enemy appears and beats up everyone. I mean, look how scary this boss is (more to said boss in character by the way). After being beaten up however, the Nakama get a powerup, and defeat the boss. Repeat. And again. Aaand again. 
 
Art: 6/10 
I won't mention something about the unique Art-Style. Everyone has read up on that one already. Some might like the cartoonisch, and also childish, artworks. I don't BUT I wouldn't cut 4 points for such a reason. So what about those 4 points? Battleanimations. This single word is enough. One Piece has one of the lousiest animations in terms of battle of all time. Repeating scenes, classic cut scenes, everything. Just in the last fight I watched Zoro had a fight, where he parried an attack with his three swords. They change the camera angle, and suddenly Zoro holds only two of his three swords, with the last one being in his Saya. And the sad thing is, this isn't every once in the while, those mistakes are common occurences. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
First of all, the OST/Backgroundmusic. Even though some OSTs were misplaced, the most of the OSTs are pretty good and fit the desired atmosphere. 
Second, the Voice acting: I won't hide the fact, that I like Zoros seiyu Nakai Kazuya. Ever since his first appearence in Gintama, he has been one of my favorites. The other voice actors did their share of work as well, I especially like Luffys, Namis and Choppers voices. 
Last, but not least, the opening and ending section: I'll start with this. Later on, the openings get far too long with 2:30 each. Stick to the common 1:30 damnit! Well, whatever. Most of the openings and endings blend in really well with the overall tune of the show. I don't really like the openings and endings, but they fit, which is the most important point. 
 
Character: 7/10 
Can't really say, that I really like any of the characters (besides Zoro and Nami, but thats just personal oppinion) but they have their reasons of existence. Way worse than the main crew are the completely forgettable enemies. They have puny reasons for being evil, are completely incompetent, and worst of all, some of them even turn face (wrestlingterm: becoming one of the good guys) after being defeated. 
 
Enjoyment: 5/10 
What can I say? Some of the jokes were okay, but serious matters are painfully dump to watch, because the series is just completely unable to stay serious. Also, for a battleshonen, the battles are awfully bad. Well, at least I'm able to crack a wry smile. Every once in a while that is. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
Many think of One Piece as one of the Big Three Battle Shonen, together with Naruto and Bleach. Since I haven't seen Bleach yet, I won't compare those two, but there is no problem with comparing it to Naruto, right? Overall, Naruto wins by a large margin. Its battles are better, the soundtrack is better, the art is more detailed, the series can stay more serious, and whats most important to me: The whole skill system is more complex, but also way superior to One Pieces Devils Fruits etc. An example as ending? Okay: Why for example do Devils Fruits Users not loose their powers in rain? Due to Oda because its moving water. But at the same time they loose their powers in rivers. And strictly speaking: Oceans are moving waters as well. The only unmoving water I can think of are swamps. 
 
If you got questions or feedback, its highly appreciated.

    One Piece is honestly the best show I’ve ever watched in my entire life. What Oda, the creator of OP, gave us, was more than just a story - he gave us an entire world, filled with unique people with their own backstories. It takes the time to tell us about the different characters Luffy meets along the way, and all of their stories are somehow interconnected, whether it’s tragic or happy or strange or mysterious.  It really puts everything in perspective, y’know? That everyone on planet earth has their own story and there’s no end to it. 
 
 
It takes the time to show how its multidimensional characters grow, change, and how it affects the world. Or how it doesn’t affect the world. Like that dog back in Orange Town, who was just trying to protect his late master’s house… tons of instances like that is why I love One Piece. It’ll make you cry, laugh, smile, squeal in excitement, and just be in awe of how well put-together the world of One Piece is. 
 
 
It’s not just all about the characters, though. The overarching plot of One Piece is amazing, as well. In the world ruled by a corrupt government and pirates constantly battling for power, there’s always something new to see, and always something else to affect the plot. The essence of a plot is that it’s formed by hundred and hundreds of character decisions, and you begin to understand the story as you see said decisions being made. You’re shown all of the main character’s goals, and why. You’re shown why villains do what they do, and sometimes you even feel bad for them - like Arlong or Hody Jones, who grew up in hatred of humans from what they’d done to Fishman Island. You’re shown all of the evil of the world, and how it’s always going to be there, and that makes the world of OP that more realistic. You’re shown all of the good of the world, and how some even die in the name of justice, and how some even used to be villains. Everything you see in One Piece just… makes sense. It’s all interwoven - the characters, the backstories, the plot, everything.  
 
 
The wonderful world building, the incredible cast of rich, relatable characters, and the plot that makes you just ache to see the next episode makes watching One Piece through all the way worth it.  
 
 
I will say, this show wasn’t even in my top ten until around episode 100, and not in the top three until around three hundred. The first 20 or so episodes felt like a drag. Many are turned off by One Piece’s art, and others dislike the slow pace. I wasn’t too fond of either at first. Now, I believe One Piece is the best show - no, the best story in general to ever exist. 
 
 
If you haven’t watched One Piece, watch it. Now.

    I always brushed one piece off as a weird looking show with a strange hat boi as an mc. I didn’t decide to give it a try until my friend told me he watched over 500 episodes and never got bored. I decided to give a watch and immediately was hooked in with Luffy’s smile And charisma. 
 
 
At a first glance I’ll admit it, the characters in one piece look really strange. But once you learn of the past and story’s it immediately changes the way you see them and you can see how Oda get better and better at doing this as the series progresses. An example could be Zoro. Zoro seems like a street rat that uses 3 swords for whatever reason but until you learn about how he got stuck bounty hunting and his past with Kuina your perception of him really does change. 
 
 
The world that one piece is set in is one of the stupidest but also the smartest. I say this because there are so many places or islands that have a fully functional Government but when it comes to looks it just goes all over the place but I think this is what keeps me so interested in this world. With every new area you discover it fells like a breath of fresh air from the last place. This really helps you stay hooked and invested in the worlds setting. 
 
 
Overall I would say one piece is one of the best shows I have experienced. From its happy look to its sometimes heartbreaking back stories. This show stays consistently good throughout the majority of the series and kept me flipping pages and watch episode after episode.

    Before I start my review, I would like to say that this is my first review ever on an anime. I’ve reviewed it as fairly as possible with positive and negative points and spoiler-free. If you have any comments, disagree with me, or whatsoever, leave a comment on my profile.  
 
Well on to the review: 
 
''An anime about Pirates? Are you an idiot!?'' That's what I often get to hear. But if you're already reading reviews for One Piece then you’re halfway there. 
 
One Piece is an anime based on the manga of Echira Oda and is part of the ‘’big three’’, which consists of Naruto, One Piece and Bleach. Many people are biased against One Piece, because of the plot. Pirates sounds way too lame compared to other things. I actually thought so too. After a while I decided to give it a shot, and I’m glad that I did. One Piece is one of the few anime that I enjoyed most. Like any other Shonen Jump it has typical Shonen Jump characteristics, like nakama ,etc. Still One Piece is an unique anime and definitely one of the best in its kind.  
 
Story (10/10): 
Like I already mentioned before, many people are prejudiced about One Piece (and start hating it) because of its plot. To be honest, One Piece’s plot is one of the best plot I’ve ever seen. You have a boy named Luffy, who accidently ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi (Rubber Devil Fruit) and gained the powers of rubber. Well, sounds lame right? Wrong! The powers in One Piece are really nice and sometimes actually surprise you. There are a lot of different kinds of devil fruits, which makes the story interesting. The story is divided into arcs (not a lot of fillers, watched them all and enjoyed them all), which all build up the story. It’s really well done. You have some events that happen around episode 80 or something, which lead to another huge event around episode 450. The interesting thing about the One Piece story is that everything is connected. One event leads to another and so on. They aren’t afraid to kill of some people and the story is just simply awesome. One thing that people tend to complain about is One Piece’s pacing. One Piece has been at a steady pacing for a while now (I think 1 chapter/episode), which is the reason why it doesn’t have a lot of fillers. Most of the times this isn’t a problem, but sometimes things do feel stretched out (you won’t notice this if you marathon everything though). Anyway the pacing is in my opinion no problem at all. 
 
Art (8/10): 
One Piece has an unique artstyle. Many people think that it’s ugly, but it’s actually very pretty. The art in the manga is beautiful and I wish that the anime could have adapted the art style better at some points. If it was the manga then the art would be a 10/10, but it isn’t. The One Piece anime has just regular animation, something that you'd expect from a Shonen Jump that has been airing for a while. It’s nothing special, but still decent. Sometimes it does have some awkward animation though.   
 
Sound (9/10): 
Hands down, One Piece has one of the best soundtracks ever. Every soundtrack is simply awesome. It’s just like when you hear one specific soundtrack, you know that shit is going down and that Luffy is going to beat the crap out of someone. I do think that they could have done better at some points of the anime.  
 
Character (9/10): 
One Piece has a lot of characters and to be honest, I love them all. Each character has an unique background, which makes them, uhm, yeah, unique. I admit that some characters are more likeable than other characters (I’m not naming any characters, since I would be spoiling). Sometimes some characters annoy me (doesn’t happen a lot though, happend like 2 times or something?). 
 
Enjoyment (10/10): 
One Piece is one of the animes that I enjoyed most. One Piece feels refreshing and unique, everytime that you watch it. I’ve been following it weekly for some time now, and I’m always looking forward to next week. I don’t know how to put it, but it’s just fun to watch. It’s funny and serious at times when it needs to. Fillers are almost nonexistent and most of the fillers are actually enjoyable (lol, the G-8 arc was awesome). I can just say that I enjoyed One Piece a lot. 
 
Overall (10/10): 
One Piece is without a doubt a masterpiece. Everyone should at least give it a try. Then you can see for yourself how awesome it is (that’s why it's the best sold manga ever). Anyway I can’t guarantee that everyone will like it, but I’m pretty sure that 90% will. You should atleast give it a try. 
 
So what are you waiting for ...?

    After seeing the scores I have given this anime, many people might be confused by my overall score. Don't get me wrong, One Piece is my favorite manga, hands down. The story is wonderful, the characters are great, the art style is unique and colorful.  
 
However, One Piece is a long running shounen manga that is no where near being finished. Usually with these types of series, the anime will add in long filler arcs to allow the manga to put out more material for the main story. Naruto and Bleach are notorious for this and even Fairy Tail had to resort to doing this as well. During its early years, One Piece did this as well, but currently it has resorted to animating one chapter per episode. And this leads to an enormous amount of filler in each episode. Fights are drawn out. Running places takes five episodes. An entire conversation or death scene can take up a full episode. After a while, this sort of thing gets very frustrating, and I have had to put the anime on hold twice now.  
 
Another issue I have with this show is the animation and this also ties in with the filler problem. The animation is very sloppy and its pretty bad when you're watching an episode and notice at least three separate occasions where the same animation is used (I'm pointing fingers at you, Coliseum animation!). The animation will also pan over crowds or go between different characters for 15-30 seconds to fill time, and it could be that no one is actually speaking at all during this.  
 
Honestly, if you're really interested in getting into One Piece, I would recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime. You'll only get frustrated with the filler and animation.  
 
EDIT: As mentioned above, I have dropped this series twice: once in Puck Hazard and once in Dressrosa. I am currently four episodes into the Mink/Zou arc and am probably three episodes away from finally rage quitting this horribly animated adaption of my favorite manga. The filler is unbelievable and the animation is terrible. DO NOT watch this anime past the Timeskip if you are interested in One Piece. Please, for the love of god, just read the manga.

    One Piece is one of the most well known anime/manga and is one of the longest running show ever. It revolves around the Straw-hat Pirates lead by Captain Monkey who strives to become the Pirate King. He is the possession of the Gum Gum Fruit which allows him to stretch his body like rubber. 
The arcs are very good and enjoyable and slowly show the character development. 
The Straw-hats are bunch of very enjoyable and rowdy characters which are very easy to like. Each member has their own goals and unique abilities which help the plot in many ways. 
The show is way too long... but it is a must watch. You will understand the show's amazing story and mysteries only if you have watched the show.  
The anime shows how the Straw-Hats development from being weak pirates to one of the most wanted pirates in the One Piece world. 
The manga has now proceeded to the best arc of One Piece and I strongly suggest to pick up this legendary series.

    One Piece is one of the best battle shounen ever made. 
 
It's honestly not that bold of a claim to make considering that it's currently the most popular shounen series ever, however it's a statement I stand by. 
 
One Piece perfectly captures the key element that makes these types of series enjoyable: being fun. 
 
The series injects this child-like imagination into almost everything it does. A surfer dude cyborg? Why not? A samurai that uses three swords by holding the third in his mouth? Sure! A dude whose super power is stretching his body like rubber? Screw it, make him the main character! 
 
The world of One Piece is colourful, lively, and rewards those that stick through with some incredible moments of world-building. The setting of One Piece has a believably large sense of scale that lends far more weight to story and conflicts that the characters find themselves in, especially as the series goes on. 
 
Of course, One Piece wouldn't be what it is without its central cast of characters; the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
The Straw Hats are a diverse and lovable group of characters that few other series have managed to match in terms of group-chemistry. Every member of the Straw Hats bounce off of each other in hilarious ways that makes them feel alive. Each member has a unique relationship with the other; some are rivals, some look to others for support, and others just love goofing off. What unites all of them is their sense of camaraderie and... of course... *friendship*. 
 
It's also good to emphasize what One Piece honestly isn't. It's not some complex, deep, philosophical epic that you may expect it to be from how much hype the series garners. In some ways One Piece can feel that way for fans, but it's best not to come into the series expecting it to have that level of impact right out of the gate. One Piece is a slow-burn that gradually finds its footing and sucks the viewer in. If action shounen is your thing and you're willing to strap in for a longer series; you'll find yourself rewarded for doing so. 
 
With all of this positivity, there are some negatives as well. If you take a look at my anime list you'll see that I dropped the One Piece anime some years ago; and for good reason. Despite my love for this series, and the good memories I have watching it, I will admit that the anime is not all sunshine and roses for its entire duration. One Piece is a VERY long show with its ups and downs, and depending on the person, one of those ""downs"" may be the one that breaks you and causes you to quit the show. Mine came 650~ episodes in, and since then I've chosen to keep up with the manga instead as it takes up less of my time and is more up-to-date with the story than the anime. 
 
The anime's critical flaw is in its pacing, a flaw not unique to One Piece, but one that prevails through most other anime adaptions of ongoing shounen series. There are points in the One Piece anime that are infuriatingly slow-paced, to the degree where it merely feels like the show is there to waste your precious time. There aren't many filler arcs in One Piece like in shows such as Naruto and Bleach, but there is a LOT of episode fluff. Expect constant reaction shots, long recap segments, repeated reuse of flashback scenes, and fights being dragged out by constantly cutting away to other events. For most of its run, One Piece managed to reward viewers who stuck through those slow points with some amazing moments, however after a while those rewarding moments became fewer and fewer, and the overall pacing of the anime slowed further and further. 
 
Of course by skipping the anime you're missing the amazing voice acting and music, which help emotionally elevate scenes far above how they were depicted in the manga. 
 
So you may be asking why I'd give a show that I dropped a 9; and that's simply because for most of my time watching One Piece, it was my favourite thing ever. To be honest it still is. For a show to give me hundreds of episodes of memories and enjoyment is a feat, and I can't discount those HUNDREDS of episodes due to a later chunk that caused me to fall off. I didn't come away cheated or disappointed, in fact my love of One Piece skyrocketed again once I picked up the manga. 
 
This begs the question: would I recommend One Piece to you? It honestly depends on who you are. Do you absolutely love battle shounen? Does the art style appeal to you? Does weekly shounen anime pacing annoy you? Do you have a lot of time on your hands? Are you prepared to start a long-running show that currently has no visible end? 
 
Depending on how you personally answer those questions, the One Piece anime may or may not be for you. Personally I couldn't binge the show now like I could when I watched it in my teens. However that doesn't stop me from fondly remembering my time watching it.

    Some of the things about the story line I don't like is, they make the recaps on the arcs way two long and the flash backs  are place in odd places. Other then that the anime is good. The pace is not to fast or not to slow for me. If it went faster i would feel like they are trying to finish the anime faster and leaving to much important detail out. So if your some one who like the anime's that can end in 24 episodes this is not for you. Yes i get what people think. this anime stated in 1999 and still has a ways to go. I can say that I didn't even start to watch it till back in 2017, but this pace is needed.i tried speed watching the anime and i got all backwards. 
 
The art does change in the anime more then once but that could just be because the art most people like seeing change to. Just for the love of god don't put to much CGI in. one of the movies CGI and that was to much of a change. 
 
The character are great. well most of them are. I get that anime's have to put a lot of big egos on the bad guys and put too much ego on the marines, but they push two much of the i am more powerful then you attitude in that it dose get old. Also the times when a secondary main character dose the this is my problem i got to fix it on my self but let me tell you everything for no reason is also getting old. you see it in a lot of anime's. The main straw-hats crew and the heart crew are some of my favorite because yes the can be both funny and serious at the same time.  
 
I guess the people who would like this is those who don't mind a anime that takes a while for it to end. Also those who are just happy about being able to watch the characters they love is a filler. i'm just happy that i don't have to fine something to watch for half a year.

    Ultimately, what you have to accept when you're considering watching a show like one piece is that it's over 800 episodes long, and still not over. This is a daunting task even for the most skilled of bingers. As much as I love this show, there are somethings I feel that I need to inform you of before I can honestly recommend One Piece to anyone. 
 
There are two very distinct parts of One Piece, and that is a result of the 2yr time-skip that occurs. For the portion of the anime up until the time-skip I would recommend watching every episode (including filler). Practically all of the early filler episodes utilize one piece's comedy and characters to their fullest, and the fillers don't feel like filler; these fillers feels very in-line with the source material. However, after the time-skip this changes, and the fillers become wastes of time. Additionally, you'll want to instantly skip the first 4-5 minutes of every episode in the post time-skip section as that is simply the opening + 3 or 4 minutes of re-cap. 
 
If you do get up-to-date, you will notice a few instances of lack-luster animation, however, this is true of any anime that runs on weekly releases. Luckily, the scenes that really matter still seem to be getting the attention they deserve.  
 
One Piece's biggest problem is that they have purposely slowed the pacing of the anime to give the manga more time. The best solution if you dislike the pacing, but wish to keep enjoying the story, is to simply read the manga.  
 
Ultimately, I can't end a review on one of my favorites on a bad note, so I will end it with this. One Piece's greatest strength is that it's about how its protagonist (Luffy) changes the world. This is unique to many other stories which are generally focused upon how the world or other factors change the protagonist, and is one of the reasons why One Piece is able to continue a connected story over hundreds of episodes.

    I can describe one piece as a complete experience . if you want commedy , drama , mystery , adventure ,politics , a great story about freindship ,a story about dreams (romance down ) , a story about idols and how they affect children , a story about family and the most incredible love in the world (the love of mother ) you will find all of these here .  
for the story i think it's the greatest story the widest one i admire how oda sensei writes all of these characters ,compines all these legends together to make a very wide world like the one of one piece .  
when i taik about characters i'm confused about whom i talk about and whom i let . the different dreams and ideolgy of them . too many characters with too many secrets and you trying to figure these secrets  
i promise you that you will laugh a lot cry alot get on your nerves a lot and you will have the greatest joy. 
may be the only disadvantege is the slow rhythm . 
i conclude with my of favourites lines of the entire series "" peoples' draems have no end ""

    I've always wondered what my first anime review would be, and it's prob fair that is with the first anime i actually set down and watched, and that anime is One Piece. 
 
So actually i watched about 100 episodes of One Piece in 2015 before droping it for 4 years and i can say is one of the things i regret the most, every year i would try watching again but never would do more then 3 eps, then after watching HunterXHunter i got the will to watch One Piece again and i can tell you for sure is one of the best anime that exist and by far the best shonnen. 
 
So this has been said multiple times but i'll say it again people that deslike/don't watch one piece all say the same things: It's too long, i don't like the art, luffy and usopp are annoying, i've heard even people complaining it doesn't have enough Deaths but that's nonsense, still it's obvious u actually need to take a big effort and time if u wanna watch this show but the trip is just way above any other in terms of long term quality, to me it's pretty clear One Piece was probably always better then other shonens and now most of the big ones have all already ended while One Piece may be going for another huge climax soon on ep 900 and we still have no idea of when is ending.  
 
Now let's just make clear what makes One Piece so great: The Story is amazing, things that happened on ep 90 may get a whole new meaning on ep 300, in One Piece when a new character apear we have no idea who it is, could be a random guy or could be very important later, that beeing said i don't think any anime has the character originality as One Piece does, and it's amazing how after all this time there's still very interesting characters yet to apear or get explored, looking at what people wanna see on watching anime on my opinion One Piece gets almost everything right, the Art style may look a bit different at first but when u get used to it it's impossible not to love, the OST's and Openings are simply Amazing if ur a lover of music in anime and the story like i said it's amazing theres just so many Plot Points is hard to keep track on all of them but unlike other animes they don't start to not make sense or look forced, it seems like in one piece everything ties perfectly and for the enjoyment let's not forget that One Piece is a comedy and while most shonnens also are One Piece is also by far the funniest to me the Thriller Bark and Impel Down are perfect in that for me, probably are the funniest arcs in my opinion and despite that have deeply touching moments in both of them so basically the 2 funniest arcs also had 2 of the most sad scenes in the show and beeing able to do that is what makes One Piece almost perfect for me, and if that's not enough for u there's some of the Best fight scenes in anime, i'll admit that Other shonnens probably have more and ""stylish"" fights then One Piece but then alot of them end up not living to the hype or sometimes feel forced, in One piece this never happens to me all fights and epic moments felt absolutely real and not forced at all specially Luffy's battles that often hold huge stakes for the story itself. That beeing said if u are looking for a long running anime series look no further, One Piece is the best ur gonna get and even if u dont have the time for it.

    Look, One Piece as a franchise is fantastic. Good story, great characters, entertaining fights and a nigh unparalleled world. The problem is that adaptations sometimes don't do justice to the source material, and One Piece is by far the best example of this.  
 
I started watching the anime about 2 months after finishing the manga, and after forcing myself through 40 episodes of terribly paced, poorly animated (even for the time) slop I had to quit. Once when I watched it late at night I literally fell asleep because so little happened in each episode, EVEN after skipping the mandatory 5 minute recap on top of the intro and outro (only just over half of each episode is actually new content.) 
 
Even this content which should be enjoyable is ruined by egregiously long pauses, shots of character reactions, flashbacks and anything Toei animation can do to save a buck, because they know that however badly they treat the anime it'll still be one of the most popular in the world thanks to the franchises overwhelming popularity. 
 
TL;DR : Toei Animation ruined what should've been an easy 8/10 + series, just read the manga because that's actually good

    It was the art that prevented me from starting this anime, however, I'm so glad I got over that. I actually really enjoy unique style now. 
 
 
This anime is definitely action-based as opposed to character based. However, I love the characters, my favorite being Luffy and then Zoro. Though it isn't focused on developing the characters, the characters are one of the reasons I really enjoy this anime ( I still re-watch it). I love Luffy's determination, as well as how he is not the stereotypical calm, cool, collected pirate captain. The way he surprises other characters is very enjoyable to me. 
 
Another reason why I love the anime is the intense devotion the Strawhat Pirates share with each other. 
 
Though sometimes the plot is predictable - Luffy meets strong character, he has to fight, then eventually (after struggling) he wins - I still love it. Once you get past the first several episodes, it becomes addictive. (For me it was actually around episode 32 that I watched it straight through!!!). 
 
All in All, this, HunterxHunter (2011), Naruto / Naruto Shippuden, are my favorite animes, and always will be!

    I really love this series :D I managed to watch up to the latest episode (right now) which is ep 509 in 2 weeks during the holidays -__- craaaazy. 
The characters are great, luffys body develops muscles as the story proceeds, its really interesting but a shame only 1 ep airs every week ): 
 
OVERALL its a great story line, full of adventures, not so serious like Naruto (love naruto too :D but one piece is funnier, and the characters are bright) tadaa 
 
Sorry first time reviewing.. forgot what i had to write in it but YEAH watch watch watch :) recommended for all yous that love animes with an actual story line not just romance and suchh, however there are many eps so.. -__- well i managed 509 in a week and a half so GOODLUCK BOO :D

    Before I started watching it I never considered once this series would become such a big part of my life, not just mine but my friends and siblings also. It's a fantastic show to have a matron through, granted it has a slow start but you'll soon get into it after a couple of episodes, and once you do I can assure you you're going to kiss your social life good bye! 
Don't let the odd art style or ridiculous number of episodes deter you from watching this masterpiece. There will never be a boring moment. It has a truly amazing cast of characters that you will come to love as you learn about their stories and watch them grow. One Piece is a fantastic adventure with epic fight scenes, imaginative characters, wild landscapes, and unforgettable music. You will laugh, cry, feel anger, sadness, and joy as you make your way through the Straw Hats' epic quest. This is the story of Monkey D. Luffy becoming the King of the Pirates.

    I had started watching/reading One Piece in early February of this year and it is an amazing watch. As I had not watched this as a kid, this will not be biased and won't be clouded with 4kids terrible dub or nostalgia. 
 
Story: 9/10 
The story for one piece is very interesting, unique and big. Oda has done an amazing job with providing really great stories across each arc, each with its own feel and style. While at first before the grand line the story might come as underwhelming, it gets alot better. Around Arlong Park is their I personally got hooked watching it. Alot of the arcs is unique when it comes to its plot and is a great journey with the crew. Their is some complaints though. Some events are stretched longer than it should be and rushing in others, but overall the journey and thrill of the story is great. 
 
Art: 7/10 
The art of the show is a hit or miss at times. At times the show looks great considering the length of the series but at times, takes a noticeable hit where their would be low frames, alot of still shots and disproportionated characters. Overall the art is good, but not great.  
 
Sound: 8/10 
If it was purely for the soundtrack of the show itself, this would easily be a 9/10. Each song is unique and fits Into the show and the events that are taking place throughout the show. With orchestra level songs to truly sad piano music to jazzy blues, the music is great, though often repeats itself, is great. However,  the sound effects itself are okay. While their is alot of good sound effects like specific character sound effects to luffys arm stretching, it's quite iconic. Their is alot of sound effects that are quite cringeworthy and too childish for me. Often only have 1 or 2 variations of the sound, Toei would often play the sound effect way too much and be quite annoying. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
The characters in One Piece are great, with a variety of memorable characters, especially in the straw hats crew. Alot often having deep and pronounced back stories and with unique charactistics that are enjoyable to watch. Even the villains, often with interesting motives and personalitys. If I had one gripe with the show/manga, Oda often has a lot of of pretty much unmemorbale, serving little to no actual purpose in the show besides making an event longer than it should be. The Characters are a great aspect of the show. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall Conclison: 9/10 
Overall, the show is great and though the show is quite lengthy and has its faults, the journey and story is amazing and should be enjoyed. I absolutely adored the character development and variety of locations the crew explores and the variety of characters they meet along the way. I recommend the show highly of you give it the time as it's a great show to watch and make you want to watch more alot of times.

    One piece is a show that will put many people off watching it. The art style seems sloppy at first and the show starts off incredibly slow. The first 70 or so episodes have amazing points in them, emotional, heart breaking, absolute epic power of nakama badassery but moves at an incredibly slow pace. 
 
 But. You have to watch this anime because once you get into it you will be hooked. One piece is anime that unlike other anime never gets worse. If you start the show and thinks its good it will only get better.  
 
Each arc has all the support epicness and emotion of the previous arc. This is a show that if you stick to it gets bigger as the scale increases the world expands and the characters grow deeper. The world is huge and this anime deserves to be the king of shounen. 
 
One piece is what happens when you get everything awesome from pirates of the carribean and dragonan ball z andd ramp it up by 590 times because that is how many episodes there currently are. This is the best anime that has 500+ episodes and unlike other shows it doesn't involve rehashing previous plot elements. It is epic and do not let its premise and appearance fool you.

    It was a long time since I didn't watch an anime , but in September 2014, I had some time and when I was young some friends were watching One Piece, but , I didn't care because I was a fanboy of Dragon Ball and I didn't really touched other animes either.  
 
One day, I just said why not ? Then I started watching , how do you say ? That one anime who made  me fall in love with the Otaku world. 
 
This anime is so damn epic, the bromance between characters , all the epic scenes and of course , the smile of Luffy and his nakama who are each time living amazing adventures ( Not much details on that, discover by yourself like I did)  
 
This anime made me cried , made me smiled , made me laugh (when Luffy imitates Sanji lol) . This anime made me understood how the anime world is powerful. 
 
 
I spent a whole 3 months watching from episode 1 to 667 and now till December I watch the episode each week and we are in 690, I bought the two Pirate Warriors game and now I'm so hype for the third one .  
 
I spent like 300 hours of my life watching this anime , and it was worth it. 
 
Thanks a lot Oda , you made me a better person , I have a new hobby, expand the Otaku world to all my social circle (2 new Otakus btw (:))  
 
 
Watch it, you'll never regret it.

    One Piece. Right now, even at the sound of its name, I’m feeling kind of psychotic and obsessed. There are so many people out there, considering it immature, hollow, ridiculously long, boring, tiring, an anthem to sexism and homophobia and of course, overrated. I’ll try not to spoil anything, but I cannot promise you, guys. 
 
There’s no doubt that One Piece’s duration is huuuge but it’s neither boring nor tiring. And I’m not saying this because I’m a total fan-girl but due to the fact that millions of people, all around the world, support it, all these years, without missing an episode, even the filler ones. Watching it, makes you laugh hard, be amazed of the battles, be happy for no reason and cry your eyes out, out of nowhere. 
  
I am not going to disagree about its kind of childish side either, but there’s no way I am going to call it immature. It’s true, that sometimes, its jokes and lines can be puerile but in a good way that points out innocence and chastity. 
 
Now let’s settle the whole issue about sexism. The target of these theories is one of the main male roles, named Sanji. He is the guy that refuses to hit a woman even when his crew is in danger, he is the guy that saves the female crewmates firstly every single time, he is the guy that nosebleeds seeing women in all sizes and colors, but wait: why is this believed to be so pathetically sexist? I think of him as an enormous exaggeration of gentlemen. He doesn’t objectify females, he is just overprotective and considers them unguarded while he believes that all of them are beautiful. Why isn’t Jiraiya (from Naruto) being so openly attacked?  
Naturally, someone can come here and tell me that even if Sanji isn’t the sexist one, the whole series is anti-feminist because there are no strong women at all. Wrong. Do you guys remember Belle-mere-san, being alone raising two children that weren’t even her own, giving up her job and sacrificing herself for the sake of others? How about Nami, Robin, Koala,Rebecca or Vivi? The two of them have huge bounties and all 5 of them have amazing mental strength. Ain, Monet, Lily Enstomach, Perona, Khalifa, Baby 5: straw hats got a hard time trying to encounter those ladies. Boa Hancock seems to be one of the 7 Warlords and come to think of Big Mama: she is equal to Shanks, I have a bad premonition about her. Maybe most of them cannot win against some really powerful men but they all display an amazing mind and spirit, just as in the real world.  
 
Let’s talk about the homophobic thing. No, as I see it, Mr 2 and Ivankov weren’t just a bother in this anime, weren’t even ridiculously shown. They both had their rough times, they both were powerful as hell and they both were respected by everyone. They were put up as something incredibly natural, that's how it is supposed to be, right? 
 
Now, let’s rate the story-line. Personally, I cannot be strict at all but even when I am trying to see it objectively, I am still giving it a 10. One Piece has an outstanding world, with awesome and original places, powers, objects and people. But the coolest thing about its story is that almost everything is connected. And when I'm telling you ""everything"", I really mean it. There are so many surprises and so many signs that give away the following plot and when you observe them, soon or late, you really feel incredibly blown away. 
 
Art:9. One Piece started airing in 1999, I started watching it at the age of 13, 3 years ago and finished the existing episodes in 2 and a half months. If I had to rate the initial episodes' art, I would probably be strict, but seeing the quality turning amazingly topnotch day by day, made me feel more familiar to this anime in a way I cannot really explain. As much as it concerns about its cartoonish character that doesn't fit the anime world, I'm refusing it with all my power and mind. Personally, from the begining i got to love its kind of ""weird"" animation. 
 
Sound:10. Yes, a ten. The soundtracks are all wonderful and the voice-actors really match every character giving a superb performance every time. To be honest, I'm not keen on dubbed anime, so I cannot really judge them. But as far as it goes for the official japanese one, its quality is optimal! 
 
Characters:10. I've already written about one, Sanji, but there are so many of them, that you can easily identify with at least one and fall in love with at least one! They are all so different from each other and they all have their ideals and goals that turn them into respectful personalities. 
The leader one, Luffy, is similar to Ash Ketchum, Goku or Naruto. But he isn't  a copy either. He has a dream and he is not afraid of anything except of his beloved ones' loss. 
Then there goes Nami, Robin, Chopper, Franky, Usopp, Brook, Sanji, Zoro etc. Every single one of them has a harsh past and everyone has a purpose. Even though they share these two things, they're all unique. They do mistakes, have cons and bad habits, infantile sides and mature ones and they deeply value their family and friends. 
 
Enjoyment: 10. As I said above, it gives you so many mixed feelings in a way that you cannot be fed up. 
 
OVERALL: 10. You might think that I am being indulgent or just blinded of my love, but no, I am not. Okay, maybe little. 
But I am sure, that if you are open-minded, have free time and like getting life lessons through a story, you should all give it at least a chance !

    To be clear, I've been following the OP manga since it began serialization, and I follow it religiously. One Piece is the most epic saga ever written. 
 
That being said, I pretty much despise the animated version, other than a handful of movies such as Chopper's Drun Island movie 
 
To sum it up, 
- bad animation...not only bad, so little content, yet they keep repeating frames 
- bad timing and awkward presentation of punchlines 
- excessive fanservice to the point of stupidity 
- overall bad directing. They always try too hard to look cool, yet they just can't pull it off.  
 
All of these points are probably quite subjective. Over the years I have tried to watch a few episodes here and there, but I couldn't stand it. Then I figured maybe the movies (Strong World) and OVA (3D2Y special) would be better...but no. Same issues that plague the TV, just with better quality animation. 
 
That and I can't fathom watching 700 episodes of a single series. I could use that time to watch 50 other shows.

    i only liked pretty characters and shoujo with romance stories and no action.. BUT one piece is the only exception!!! The characters weren't so pretty, there's no romnce anddd its filled with action. i thought i'd hate it, but then i ended up falling in love with it 
 
Story:The story is AMAZING!!! there's funny times sad times annoyoing times everything! It's like almost as old as me! The story would totally make you wanna keep on watching 
 
Art: Of course when i watched the first episodes i reallly disliked how they were drawn and i dont like how they're drawn frequently either. they were perfectly drawn in 2009 though. I think they're adding way too much boobs on the girls:/ 
 
Character: Of course since this story began before everything else (except pokemon which was only a year older) The main characters have their own uniqe personalities that you cant find anywhere else. they even have their own laughs. 
 
I TOTALLY LOVE IT!!! There's a reason why its been going on for the past 13 years!!! HIGHLYYYY RECOMEND i think One Piece deserves a higher rank than 50 on the top anime list :((

    ONE PIECE !! Words cannot describe how much this has affected me and how much I love it. I am editing this review because I feel like I haven't wrote even NEARLY enough for my personal favorite anime.  If you think I didn't watch enough animes to make that statement well no. I have watched quite a lot. 
 
I hope this review encourages you to watch it. And for anyone who thinks it's childish I can just give you one Youtube video that will clear it all up. It's called 'One Piece in 10 minutes' and its my favorite Youtube video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMa3868D41k 
 
The story and plot start off basic (just a guy becoming the best of the kind aka pirate king) you can't deny that but as it builds up it's really one of the most fascinating, epic, interesting, creative things i've ever seen so a 10 there. 
 
Music wise I STRONGLY believe it has the best music along with Naruto (both) closely beating Pokemon, Fairy Tail and Bleach's music. Openings and endings (it stops having them after a while) are perfect. So definite 10 there.And if you don't think so then here another Youtube video.This one 'One piece best osts' and it has all the best one piece osts- 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5-FuoN7YY 
Art is SUPERB. Every island the strawhats visit are SO unique and fun. There's a lot of fun gadgets,weapons, devil fruits and such getting revealed here and there which just adds to the thrilling and pleasureful art. The animation I can't say much about since it's different each arc. My favorite animation though is the animation in Sabaody arc and East Blue Saga (a lot of people hate its animation but I LOVE it. It's very nostalgic). Then there's the extra stuff in the art (I can name a lot) but one example of what i'm talking about- a river with bunny shapes ! Some of the character designs are weird (Hachi, Bon-clay) but still it's unique while some have such awesome (again unique) character designs (Kuma, Moria, 3 Admirals, Doflamingo). 
 
The characters are some of the best i've seen as well. The main characters are Luffy (the MAIN main character you can say) and his pirate crew (who look NOTHING like the stereotypical pirates). They all have such emotional and heart-wrenching flashbacks that you pretty much INSTANTLY start to appreciate them. I myself love the heck out of all the strawhats but you 'might' not think the same. 10 character wise. But the main characters are DEFINITELY not the only reason 
 
Now some extra reasons as to why it's so awesome. There are SO many epic moments that will leave you with epic-gasms the size of Russia, SO many sad moments that will leave you crying your eyeballs off and SO many heart-warming moments which feels like your heart is being warmed up in a sauna and being massaged 24/7. I can keep babbling about them but even when i'm done I would NOT have covered even 1/3 the 'scenes' that make One Piece so amazing. 
Not to mention the powers are freaking awesome.The concept of obtaining the power are devil fruits. It's kind of stupid I know, getting powers from eating a fruit but you get used to it. The devil fruit gives you a wide range of powers.From being able to create nets to turning into leopards to turning into someone who can create earthquakes an cause cracks in the air. There's just TOO many!! Plus it has my favorite power of all time - rubber (yes Luffy's devil fruit power). And there are other unique powers too. SMOKE is one.  
 
It's only missing romance. But that's not important partly because we have Sanji. So that's not a flaw AT ALL in my book. So yeah for now I can't think of any flaws with this anime other than say the length and filler which aren't that big to me (I will soon mention why). 
 
Now I will counter the flaws people say it has- 
 
The animation for the beginning is bad. NO it's not. that was made somewhere near the 2000s so OBVIOUSLY the animation back then is not going to be very good. But it has the best animation for back then(my opinion). 
 
Too many FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. One Piece actually has some really awesome fillers though (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of One Piece fillers' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip. 
 
Too long. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 3 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times). An whenever I wasn't busy I marathoned it. An plus I myself like it long. If something's good then wouldn't you want more of it? 
 
If you are not giving it a chance or have watched like 2 episodes and don't like it then watch these episodes- 1-3 (they are not that good but it's just for an introduction to the show), 4, 24, 26, 35 and 36. Then resume from episode 5 once you know you will love the series. 
 
This is the longest review I did but its worth it getting my opinion across about what I believe to be the greatest 'thing' ever. I have more reasons for giving it a 10 but you might not and probably won't relate to them. there may be some reasons here you might disagree with me for but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this 10/10. 
 
So keep watching it cause 'it be one of the most fuscinaten things you'll eva see in the deep blue of the sea'. And maybe you'll even think it to be 'the greatest and most fun adventure of your life', just like I do. 
 
Overall rating- Gazillion/10.

          This is the first anime I watched and alhtough I loved it at first, due to crappy animation and episodes consisting of %90 recap recently, Im really sad and giving this show an overall of 5.  
      Almost all of the characters are loveable in One Piece. The story revolves around Luffy traveling from island to island as he makes new friends to find One Piece. This adventure is generally funny, sometimes sad, but enjoyable in overall. However, as I stated before, the crappy animation totally ruined this anime(at least last 200 episodes), but you can still read manga tough.  
      If in future, some good animation company summarize the whole story to 200 epsiodes or so with great animation, this will be one of the best animes without doubt. But, currently, I do not suggest watching this to anyone.

    When One Piece is over it will probable be known as the greatest shonen- battle anime of all time. 
 
One Piece, an adventure following the main character Monkey D. Luffys journey on becoming the pirate king, who has sailed all over Grand Line. During the journey he finds new crewmates, each with a different charcter and goal. The difference with One Piece and other animes is how each crewmate gets his 
?her own backstory, making them so much more lovable, and you relate to them much more than you rodinary would. Despite the harsh jokes, and malignanat behaviour towards each other, they are bonded with the bonds of nakama that can not be cut. With One Piece you follow a journey where you probably will cry, laugh, and scream with excitment over the epic battles, intense arcs and great plotting.  
 
One thing with One Piece is that there are so many character outside the strawhats, each with their unike abilitiy and character design that you just love. Even thou you barely se them you cling to them, wondering what they will do next. Shanks, Ace Whitebeard, Mihawk, Law and many others. One Piece is perefectly organized, you wont find a single plot-hole, and the story is filled with mysteries. The story line is impregnible, and the story line can not be compared with other shonen-battle animes, that are great, but nowhere nere the level of One Piece Greatness. 
The only flaw is that it sometimes can be slow paced, but considering the amount of episode, it wont affect the greatness of the story.

    One Piece is and will always be one of my favorite anime shows, however there are some things that could have been better. 
 
Story: 9 
     The story of One Piece started out pretty simple.  Become the king of the pirates.  In a way, to me this is similar to Naruto's goal of becoming Hokage.  We all know its going to happen, we just don't know how.  In order to reach this simple goal, many smaller goals take place.  This includes finding a ship, gaining crew members, crossing the grand line, and finding the pirate king's treasure and each of these smaller goals contain more objectives within.  It's these simpler objectives that makes the main goal of the story better.  The reason why this is not a 10 is because the story is sometimes repetitive.  For example, each time a new crew member is introduced it goes like this;  New member introduced, member in some kind of trouble, main character helps new member, new member becomes official.  This happens EVERY time.  Although its predictable, this is still enjoyable because we get to see the process of how it happens. 
 
Art: 7 
     You've probably already heard the artwork sucks.  To me this is not the case.  Yeah, in the first couple of arcs the artwork could have been better, but they were never terrible.  Keep in mind the show was out for 15 years.  As time progressed, so did the artwork.  Now, I'd say the art is actually pretty good.  Not the best, but not bad either. 
 
Sound: 10 
     I don't have much to say about the sound.  The music fits the theme of the show and makes it that much better. 
 
Character: 9 
     The character development is great!  Throughout the show, the viewers grow closer to each of the characters.  I'm not an emotional person, however there were a couple of times where because I was so attached to the characters, tears began to form once something bad happened.   
     The only flaw yet again is that it repeats itself.  One way that the viewers grow towards the characters is that each time a new one is introduced, there is a flashback of the character as a child showing the hardships they went through.  Yes, this is a good way to help the audience relate to the character, but to do this every time starts to take away from the show a little. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
As mentioned before, this will always be one of my favorites.  The show has everything I enjoy.  The action scenes are exciting, the story keeps me interested, just the right amount of comedy without going over the top, emotional moments, and the perfect amount of fan service ( after time skip it gets heavier, but I don't mind ).  I enjoyed this show so much I started it last summer, and caught up to the story line within the same summer.   
 
Overall: 
I say overall this anime is a 9 simply because of the repetition, and the number of episodes.  The storyline and everything else is amazing, but now a days people are busy and they don't have enough time to catch up on 685 episodes.  And to watch all these episodes knowing how the process will take place at times is kind of a drag. 
 
Thanks for taking the time to read my review.  This is my first anime review ever.  Hit me up and tell me what you think.

    One Piece is a super long anime about pirates. The aspect of pirates is still there as the show progresses but fades into the background. Aside from that I feel One Piece is one of the greatest anime's of all time. 
 
The shows as such amazing characters. The debates of who is the best characters can get a room of watchers all fired up. The main characters have so many iconic character traits to make the stand out. Even supporting character can get your emotions flowing.  
 
One Piece is an emotional roller coaster. It can take you from happy to angry the to balling your eyes out in just a few episodes. things will get fore shadowed hundreds of episodes early. the world created in One Piece has so much lore, wonders and mysteries from sky islands to fish men.  
 
Some people do not like art of One Piece but i think its what makes it so much more like able and original.  
 
The openings will get you pump up every time you start an episode. 
 
This is my favorite anime i hope it can touch you the same way it does me.

    Alright, being my favourite anime/manga, I feel a need to review this. 
 
One Piece starts off on a pretty average note. Nothing spectacular. Being a very old show (started in 1997), the art is quite shitty at first. To drop the show because of this reason alone is a bad mistake. Think of it more like a fine wine that ages exceedingly well over time. 
 
Moving on, ""it looks too childish"". I've heard that a lot from people who haven't watched it, and I'm sure I even thought it myself at one point. Sadly, Oda's unique art style does look very stylized and might be difficult to get used to. Give it a few episodes however and you will realized that the art lends itself to the plot perfectly. The designs are unique and the settings are creative. Without a doubt, you will love it in no time. 
 
It's quite fair to mention that Oda is a huge fan of exposition and meticulous planning. Love it or hate it, it only serves to add that extra layer of depth to the story. All his story arcs have a lasting impact and he never forgets about the characters he introduces. The unbelievable lack of any real plot holes in such a long running series demonstrates his attention to detail and love of his craft. 
 
Sure, many of you will scoff when you hear One Piece is a masterpiece. Really thou, I scoff at that too. Oda makes mistakes like any author and the plot moves quite slow at some points (a disease mostly exclusive to the anime). However, what One Piece excels at is its sheer amount of entertainment. So what if it's not Shakespeare. It will definitely bring you more fun than Hamlet ever would. 
  
Overall, One Piece has grown on me like no story ever has. Throw away your doubts and give it try. Before you know it, you'll only be wanting more. 
 
 
---Common misconceptions and preposed solutions--- 
 
-Think you're too mature for ""shounen shit""? 
Get over yourself.  
 
-Not a fan of long ass anime?  
Read the manga! I highly recommend it as it is devoid of the many pacing issues present in the anime. 
 
-Actively hate on it because it's part of the Big 3? 
Again, get over yourself. ""Big 3"" is an incredibly moronic way to lump three totally different manga together just because of their sales. 
 
-Hate it because of the fans? 
Hate the fans, not the author. Make your own decision on the story based on YOUR experience. 
 
-Don't like the concept of pirates? 
Do ""rubber, panty loving, cyborg, samurai, sexy, reindeer pirates"" change your mind? 
 
-Manga is also too long? 
Don't gimme that shit. You're reading my long ass review so you must have quite the free time. 
 
-Already caught up in it? 
Fuck yea, brofist.

    Before I start reviewing this series , I would like to just say one thing. The anime does the manga LITTLE TO NO justice. In this review , I would be comparing the anime to its manga counterpart. How should I put it ? The closest words that I can find to describe this anime is probably , horribly-paced. 
 
Disclaimer : All of this are my personal opinion and is not intended to offend anyone by any means. 
 
Story : 7/10 
In regards to the storyline , I'm generally okay with it as unlike the other two popular shounen series like Bleach and Naruto , One Piece has little fillers (don't even get me started on Naruto please). And the anime follows the manga almost strictly in terms of storyline. I would have given it a higher mark if not for the animators screwing up the Hody VS Luffy fight. It made Luffy look superbly WEAK. 
 
Art : 2/10 
One Piece is generally infamous for it's simplicity in its drawing and many people simply cannot get used to this , often irked by it compared to other animes/manga with great character designs and such. However , since the anime follows the manga , I will not fault the anime for this. 
 
However, what's really nerve-wrecking is that the animation and drawing is shit. Pardon me but yes. Just one look at the Sabaody Archipelago arc almost gave me cancer literally. I guess that's what happens when all the senior animators are dispatched to work on the movie and the juniors are free to do with the anime. I could still list a bunch of arcs with simply horrible animations that looked as though the animators wanted to be just be done with it and that's all. (Fishman arc for example ; biggest let down of 2013 after all the finishers looked like shit) Other than that, hardly any animation in this series is worth-noticing. 
 
Sound : 6/10 
The soundtracks are generic and the only ones that really stands out from the rest is probably The Very Very Very Strongest and Luffy's Fierce Attack and maybe Giant Stronghold Takeoff. But just these three tracks itself is not able to carry such a long anime and it gets seriously repetitive after awhile. 
 
As for the openings and endings, sorry to say but I'm not a fan of any except for Share The World. I would have given it somewhere along 3/10 if not for the voice actors. 
 
The voice actors themselves. All I can say is , hats off to them. Let's start with the notable mentions. 
 
Luffy - Godlike contagious laughter and epic speech (very very very rarely). Job well done for voicing the goofy Luffy and I wouldn't be able to find anyone else that could possibly do a better job than Mayumi Tanaka. All I hope is that the voice actor lives to voice the remaining of the series (not cursing but she's getting old and the series still have a long way to go) 
 
Zoro - Needless to say , epic speech , epic speech everywhere. There's something about his voice that makes almost everything he says so much more epic than any other character would. "" I got on the wrong ship. -_+ "". Probably the only character that can make something that silly sound cool. Legit. 
 
Usopp/Sogeking - Do I even have to elaborate? This guy is freaking hilarious along with a contagious laughter and his awful screaming. And oh , the most memorable scene ? Arabasta and Enies Lobby speech about Luffy. Nuff said. Sogekinguuuu!! 
 
Chopper - This is a honourable mention because I cried at his past. No joke and his voice actor who happens to be the same seiyuu for pikachu did an extraordinary job voicing him especially during drum island. You could feel the sheer emotions coming out from her voice when Chopper starts to cry. 
 
Brook - YOHOHOHOHOHOHO! 
 
The rest of the characters were pretty average or nothing note-worthy. (Buggy is an exception to this though). This is the reason why the sound gets a 6/10 instead of a 3/10. 
 
Character : 8/10 
 
Like the manga series, each character are given a single arc to tell their past and such. After that , each character slowly gets developed and there are evident character development. One notable example would be Zoro who told Luffy when they first met that if Luffy were to do anything to hinder him from becoming the world's strongest swordsman , he would kill him. However as time passed , Zoro began to respect Luffy as the captain and would even lay down his life for him if needed (when against Kuma). 
 
Each character is also diverse and unlike other anime series that have a huge cast , all the characters are not just a vase as they contribute to the series greatly as well instead of just giving one liners just to show their 'presence'. 
 
Enjoyment : 3/10 
 
The enjoyment of this anime , sadly to say , does not live up to the story and character because of the crappy art that really put me off. But that's not the worst thing , it's the pacing that killed this anime. Toei strictly abided by it's ground rule that an One Piece episode must follow exactly one manga chapter which probably caused this downfall of a great series. 
 
Although the manga is well-paced, with the author taking seldom breaks because of his family and health issues, the anime did no justice to it because of the ridiculously slow pacing. And because of the pacing , the Whitebeard war that was absolutely amazing in the manga turned out like shit in the anime. The art was pretty decent there but the pacing.. oh god. I think I heard Luffy screaming Ace's name for over thirty episodes and a part of me simply just died. 
 
If only if the anime could pick up the pacing and do probably something like 1.5chapters/episode, or maybe improve on it by adding additional dialogues for each character which I definitely would not mind instead of showing characters running around doing nothing or FLASHBACKS. That would be great. Don't get me started on the censorship please. 
 
Overall : 3/10 
 
It's a shame that I would have to give this great series such a low grade but as things stand. It's not worthy of any higher marks in my personal opinion. Unless the anime can do something about the horrible pacing , this is the final score I would give this series. 
 
And yes, I'm heavily biased against the anime because it simply does not live up to the manga like most animes. For those that have not check the manga out , do it and you would probably find better enjoyment than wasting twenty minutes each week just staring at characters running about doing literally nothing and the plot progress like a snail.

    One of my favorite anime of all time and it only took my a few months to watch it all as that is how addicted I am to this anime. May be a bit long with 575 episodes since the time of writing of this review, but it is totally worth it.  
 
Great character development. Love Nakama power. Fighting is awesome as well as the powers. Very funny at the best of times and is very hard to stop watching once you get into it.  
 
It may be a bit slow at the beginning but that is pretty much with all anime but once you start watching a whole lot, it gets better and better.  
 
 
All I can say is pure awesome and I hope it goes on for a very long time.

    Short Sweet Reviews: One Piece!!! 
Pros: Great characters each unique and amazing, Great story full of adventure, action, laughs, drama and even tears of both sadness and joy. 
Cons: Even though One Piece is my favorite anime it was some flaws for instants: it's already 500+ which sadly will scare any new comer to this anime. Some arcs drag a little to long ans sometimes there is a little to much talking and not enough fighting not to mention the fillers though this anime is not like Bleach or Naruto which are infested with fillers but there are fillers just to warn you! 
Overall: One Piece is an amazing anime that has everything you can ever want in an anime: Action,Adventure,Drama,Superpowers, Pirates, e.c.t e.c.t. Despite it's long episode count if your intrested in this anime it won't dissapoint you!

    One Piece is those types of anime that would get people immersed in it. The story, the characters, and even things like a boat stick to the watcher's memory. But, if you those people who care mostly about the art and short fighting scenes, then this might not be the best anime for you. 
 
The story and and its characters are probably the strongest aspects of One Piece. Each ark portrays the situation very clearly, and foreshadows some future problems without being forced in. Throughout One Piece, it talks about many things like friendship, family, segregation, the abuse of power, and freedom. And, it never gets boring... other than some fillers and the first part of 300s. While some people may argue that this anime has been going on for so long that it has gotten boring, it has not. Every single part has something completely new while integrating the past to develop the story... something many stories lack. 
 
The characters are extremely diverse, so it is really easy to distinguish them. I have heard people say that the characters never develop, but looking deeper... the characters e.g. Luffy has gotten more mature, and made better decisions & past antagonists have become the victims, or protagonists. But, they have not developed so much in just 2 years that it has gotten unrealistic. 
 
Fight scenes are eh. They go on to 10-20 episodes at a time. But, for people who like fight scenes showing what is going on everywhere, then this is good for you. 
 
Then, finally the art. Nop. Not the greatest. Same with the sound. But, after the new world, it has improved greatly! So, hoping that future episodes will continue to gain better art and stuff.

    Story ~ It all begins in the East Blue, an ocean where the main character of our story, Monkey D. Luffy begins his journey in search of the legendary treasure at the end of the Grand Line known as the One Piece. The One Piece is said to be a treasure that if obtained will make all your wishes come true, the l;ast person to ever find the One Piece was Gol D. Roger the king of the pirates. Luffy aims to overturn Roger and become the new king while learning making a crew, getting a ship, battling against the world goverment itself and becoming a criminal all in favour of finding One Piece. 
 
Art ~ The art style is fantastic, it loses a point for the fact that Toei doesn't make it look very ""amazing"" but the awesome designs, clothes and fights will make up for that! 
 
Sound ~ Beautiful harmonious music that fits any mood. 
 
Character ~ Some of the most bizarre character designs ever seen although each character has their own awesome colourful personality. 
 
Enjoyment ~ I'm at the Post-Arabasta filler arc and already I'm looking forward to Skypiea, each major arc will leave you with an awesome feeling of enjoyment making you probably want to re-watch it if you ever run ahead of episodes. 
 
Overall ~ Oda's marvellous creation One Piece is not to be missed. It's a must for any adventurous anime fan!

    SPOILER FREE REVIEW 
 
One Piece is, in a word, perfect. Just perfect. Honestly, I was a bit reluctant to watch it at first because, to me, a story about a boy wanting to become ""Pirate King"" sounded so bland, cliche and overall boring, and the art style was a bit too old-school for my liking, but I was dead wrong! There is nothing boring about it. 
 
I find that a lot of people complain about the length, or the art, or whatever, but the thing is, once I really got into One Piece, I just completely forgot about the art style and the length and focused on the anime itself. By the way, the animation EVENTUALLY improves... eventually. 
 
I'd also like to discuss Luffy, the main character. I love how the stereotypical “protagonist” is just thrown out the window when it comes to Luffy. What you need to know about Luffy is that no, he is not a hero. Yes, he admits that he admires heroes, but he certainly doesn't wanna be one. Simply put, he’s a pirate. He seeks freedom and doesn’t give a damn about Justice. 
 
I guess that's one of the things I found most enjoyable; you can just get submerged in the Straw Hat’s adventure’s as if you yourself are also there laughing, having fun, or even crying with them. I just love the interactions between the crew members, (especially Sanji and Zoro) as well as just the characters themselves. Everyone in the anime is unique and have there own little quirks to them, and, seeing how absolutely massive the world of One Piece is, Eiichiro Oda certainly did a fantastic job. Also, the balance between action and humour is definitely worth mentioning. 
 
I could go on and on about how great this is, for like forever, but I don't think you wanna read that. Anyways, if you haven't watched One Piece, you really are missing out because I can say honestly and without any hesitation whatsoever that One Piece is one of those few anime which can truly be considered as a ""Master Piece"".

    Just as any other person, this is a mere opinion, a writing of what I believe about One Piece.  
 
** Very little, if not any spoilers ** 
 
Throughout all 800 episodes I have watched, I have always felt enjoyment watching One Piece. It contains amazing character development, music to hype you up for what happens even when it someday hits 1000 episodes, and despite how it may seem, it is not just an anime with a ton of episodes behind it. It's a story. A beautiful story about a boy, Luffy, and his journey. It is an anime that will make you feel happy, it will make you laugh, it will make you sad, and you will connect with the characters as if you truly knew them. As you watch, you will embrace their stories. Albeit One Piece's animation and quality may not be the best, this is not what you should watch it for. You may be able to juxtapose Luffy's story as a boy going against the biggest obstacle known to the world. He has ambitions, and the way he relentlessly strives towards them is a monument of motivation towards us, the audience.  
 
One Piece excels in character development, and is a must watch for Anime fans. It is a vast and rich story that is meant for one to embrace and fall in love with.

    One Piece 
 
One Piece is a Manga series produced by Eiichiro Oda. Before he produced One Piece he had already produced several series including ""Wanted"" and ""Monsters and Romance Dawn"". The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy whose body gets the properties of rubber after eating one of the many devils fruits (which are fruits that give certain powers) that prevent him from swimming. With his crew called Straw Hat pirates. One Piece is by far the best anime I have seen. But not everyone shares the same opinion as me, let's fix that, shall we? 
 
The story of One Piece usually consists of the Straw Hat Pirates who travel from island to island and experience crazy adventures. Although every crew member has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: reaching the end of the treacherous Grand Line. 
The style of One Piece is one of the elements that brings many people to the series. The style is quite old like Dragonball Z. Anyway, the quality of the animation improves steadily as the show moves. The show is now broadcast in HD. 
 
I absolutely love the music of One Piece. There are so many different types of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, happy, scared, epic, intense, and so on. For each of these situations there is a unique piece of music that plays in the background. What's more is that each character has his own style of music? 
 
Unlike the majority, I find the animation creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately, people see it as something or a twist and One Piece quickly assesses something infantile. An anime does not have to be complex to be good enough. It can be anything, as long as it provides satisfaction. And One Piece does that.

    This is the first review I have written on the website. I would like to start off by saying that there may be light SPOILERS in the review so if you do not want anything ruined, read with care. As I am writing this review, I have seen 557 episodes.  
 
Coming into the show, the only long running shounen that I had seen was Naruto. I loved watching Naruto grow through the years as I aged. When I was young I loved watching this 12 year old ninja refuse to give up his dream of being Hokage even when everyone told him it wouldn't happen. As I aged, so did Naruto. One Piece is a show that I was a little unsure about since it has very little filler compared to Naruto. The time commitment through the 800+ episodes is much longer than Naruto. Naruto and One Piece are very different shows, however. Naruto is focused on the adventures in and around the hidden leaf village and it does not stray too far from that area. That leads me into my next topic. 
 
After making it through some of the early arcs, I really found out what makes this show so lovable. The world building is done wonderfully. You can actually trace on a map of the world where the characters adventure to and the history that it builds is one that the writer does an excellent job of using. 
 
There are characters in the show that you might think of as throw away in similar shows. Not in One Piece. I think the best example of this in the show is Bon Clay. He is used as a villain very early in the show and is absent for hundreds of episodes before reappearing as one of my favorite characters in the show. Every characters you meet could hold importance later down the line. The writer does a great job taking advantage of this great world building and history to make the story interesting.  
 
The main cast of characters is wonderful as well. I found myself annoyed with Usopp through many of the early arcs as he had very little worth in the crew. It was hard to love his character. This is true for both the audience and himself. Through the shows run time, his goal is to face his fears and become a brave warrior of the sea. Watching him grow in strength from liar to sniper king to post timeskip helped me to gain more respect for him. Sanji and Zoro are the captains right and left hand men who always come through in a pinch. Both of these characters have their own unique traits that run through the show and always manage to make me smile. The rest of the crew helps to make one of the most lovable casts I have seen in a while, which is good because you have 800 episodes to spend with them! I would say more but talking about some of the other crew members may spoil different parts of the show. 
 
Luffy is one of my favorite characters in shounen. I like him as much if not more than our lord and savior Naruto. Luffy may be a goofy, energetic and impulsive leader, but when it comes to his friends, he will do everything in his power to fight for them. Luffy isn't a great leader because of he is wise nor is he a great leader due to his strength. He is a great leader because everyone who he leads knows he will have their back. Time and time again he shows his resolve and it is this resolve to be a good friend that gives him the strength that he gets through the show. That and his dream of becoming king of the pirates.  
 
The show has a bunch of extremely unique abilities that make the fights unpredictable and interesting. The devil fruit powers in the show can be anything making each new obstacle that the crew must overcome more fun to watch. There were certain times where I wondered how Luffy would ever manage to beat some of the baddies. I think this is where Naruto and One Piece split the most. Naruto got to the point near the end where it was one giant explosion bomb after another. Whoever made the bigger bomb was usually big daddy boi. Watching Luffy learn about the world of pirates on the grand line was just as exciting for him as it was for me because I never really knew what was coming next. 
 
I would like to note that if you are looking for a serious anime, this one might not be for you. This is not to say that there aren't any scenes where Luffy is serious. This said, One Piece does a great job of making the serious bits hold a tone that is appropriate for the scene.  
 
Overall, I love One Piece. The animation suffers in some points and it can feel like the show is moving slowly during a lot of the early material especially, but what we have is an amazing adventure with a great cast of characters that will make you feel as though you are a member of the Straw Hat crew yourself. I would recommend the show to anyone who can handle the long run time that it has or anyone who likes some enjoyable and creative fighting. Through it's flaws, One Piece is one of my favorite animes to date and I can't wait to see where the rest of my adventure with the Straw Hat Pirates takes me.  
 
Thanks for taking the time to read my reivew!  
 
*edit: I have finished the Doflamingo arc at this point. The show definitely drops in quality towards the later parts, but there is a lot to love about it.

    I love One Piece, it is not my favorite anime but i do like it a lot, i did a cosplay of Sanji in two different conventions (even though he is not my favorite character, he was one of the easiest to do). 
 
The real problem with this anime is that it's just too long, it gets repetitive real quick, i'm gonna finish the anime that's for sure, i watch the new episode each week, but some times i'd like if they could just get to the point faster, there are scenes we have seen at least 5 times since the start of the show. 
But as far as i know, this is a problem with the anime itself, not the manga. 
 
Other than that, it has a good story, enjoyable characters, an anverage humour. 
 
But i'd recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime. 
Except if you really hate reading but if you do like a good read then i'd read the manga instead of watching the anime, and if you truly love One Piece and do not care about filters and having the same scene over and over again then you can always read the manga and watch the anime. 
 
 
So in the end, it's good but they really need to go on with the story, sure it's cool to have lot of episodes of something we like, but like i said, when it's always scenes that are used over and over again, it just prove that they don't want to put too much effort on it, but once again, that's about the anime, not the manga. 
And second point, i'd actually like to see the ending, there are lot of anime which we will maybe never see the ending such as Berserk, Hunter × Hunter, etc... 
 
So good anime in itself, the primary problem is that it is very slow, too slow.

    okay, so 817 episodes... that's a lot and the beginning is quite slow, but every 100 episodes it gets faster. When i got to episode 100 I thought that it too a whole lot of time and i'm never gonna catch up, but then i got to episode 200 and I was surprised that i'm here already and around the water seven arc is where for me personally I got officially hooked to the point where i knew i was gonna watch this series to the end. The character development you get through the entire story is amazing, including the world development. the art looks kinda dumb and cartoony at first but then you get used to it and it looks amazing and the Toei animations brings out so many feelings when watching is amazing episodes 817 is a good example and episodes 278 is an older example but still fantastic. 
honestly this show is probably on of if not my favorite show in general, this show has made me feel for the straw hats like i was right there next to them going through all of the adventures with them, and this show is not like your typical adventure pirates show and luffy is the cause of that i'm not going to go into detail but luffy the main character is the main cause any one starts watching this show and no matter who your favorite character is you're gonna love luffy you're gonna smile when he does something that in retrospect is the dumbest thing that he could have done in that situation and still some how pull through. Thanks for reading my rant on this fantastic show.

    Okay so this is my first review and let me start off by saying that i wont give a 3 hour summary on one piece. But instead, i will tell you what you will be going through while you watch this anime. 
 
 When you watch this anime you will laugh, get angry, smile, be pumped up, stressed, frustrated, happy ,cry and so many other emotions that i cant explain. 
The reason you will be going through this is because when you watch this anime you will grow so attached to each character and how they feel you will feel like they are part of your family.  
 
I used to hate this show because i saw a couple of episodes on tv and didnt give it a chance but then by friend told me that if i didnt at least like the anime by episode180 he would give me 20 dollars. So i watched the anime from episode 1 to 180 and fell in love with it but i told my friend i hated it still and got that 20 dollars. But the point is that if you watch at least 180 episodes you will love it. I know most of you are thinking that if it takes 180 episodes to like something is wayyy to long but the reason that is, is because within that time span you will get to know and become friends with the characters. SO I GIVE ANYONE WHO READS THIS THE 180 CHALLENGE!!!!! If you take this challenge you must watch 180 episodes of one piece and if you dont like it by then, you can give yourself 20 dollars!!!!  
 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHa i totally made a 3 hour review and i didnt mean to lol

    Man.. every week I await for the arrival of a new episode , there was not a single letdown, the episodes rarely had repetition of previous chapters and is always filled with new content 
 
Story 8/10 
Oda is a brilliant author, many folks would just believe one piece is a pirate killing and blundering things. One piece is a story of a young boy whom aspired to be a pirate, his immature, reckless and stubborn often give author no choice but to admire his actions. The plot twists and the slow foreshadowing of  unrevealed characters such as the Yonko, shichibukai and navy admirals always kept readers in suspense. However the episode may be dragged unnecessarily, creating a turnoff 
 
Art 8/10 
The animation is great, it depicts the characters flawlessly. Toei animation also paid attention to even the smallest details, which readers would spot and would propose various theories in their mind. However there were moments where the animators fail to design the character fully, giving them a somewhat distorted face, thus a 8/10  
 
Sound 8/10 
SHINING RUNNING FOREVER and the battle music is sick. But some openings were just damn terrible, the overused yelling and screaming can be annoying at times. 
 
Character 8/10 
A solid 10/10, the character development such as the time skip period is perfected. Fueled with sadness and despair once a relative dies, the characters development closely reflects those in real life. The process is insane, as story progresses, the 10 main characters takes on tougher opponents. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 
Funny, action-packed and mind-blowing, One Piece is without doubt a very enjoyable manga. The moments when a serious situation is overridden by a hilarious comment is very funny. The sight of seeing the main character's strong determination and willpower is great to watch 
 
Overall 8/10 
IT IS A BEST SEE

    I make this clear. I'm not a fanboy who only seen this serie and proclaims that it is the best thing in the world. I saw so many anime and I truly think that One Piece is ONE of the best anime/manga of all Time.  
 
The plot is incredible and the cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in anime and the seiyuu who play them fit perfectly into it. Luffy and his friends makes you cry like a bitch and laugh like a cow and THAT'S the awesomeness of One Piece.  
 
I had goose bumps when Robin says "" I WANNA LIVE "". 
I cried for Ace in MarineFord. 
I was laughing out loud when Zorro get Lost. (9999 times)  
I was pissed of when Kuma detroyed the "" Mugiwara "" ! 
 
The Storyline is so complex that characters are only growing up and make them more Interesting and it's clever from Oda to enlarge the univers of One Piece before developing a Character.  
 
That's why One Piece is awesome. It makes you feel full of emotion and not many anime do the same.  
 
 For me One piece is just a Masterpiece and thank god it's still going on !

    When I try to get people to watch this sometimes they have to complain about the same things over and over again. When you read what it's about a lot of people think ""Pirates? No way am I watching that."" Even though it took me a while to want to watch it because I'm a picky person about art styles and what it was about, however I thought it was amazing after the first 5 episodes. The characters all have their own unique personalities which separates them from other anime characters and the first 350 I think episodes are dubbed but the ones by 4kids or whatever is NOT dub it's just something lame. You will honestly enjoy this anime packed with fighting, anime weirdness, hilarious ness and other surprises.

King of Kings. A juggernaut of anime/manga. Being one of Shonen Jump's 3 Kings, it certainly lives up to its hype. One Piece has enabled me to experience a vast world of adventure, friendship, loyalty, and dreams. With the vast world that Eiichiro Oda has masterfully created, the grippling plots that surprise you when you least expect them, and the lovable characters, it's no wonder One Piece has been the highest selling manga for several consecutive years. 
 
With over 600 episodes to date, one may be intimidated to start the series. I agree, it may seem daunting AT FIRST. But trust me, once you start, you'll be unexpectedly marathoning all the episodes and end up wanting more.  
 
Give it a try. It is not the best selling manga in Japan for nothing.

Bom, se tratando de One Piece eu sou meio sempre imparcial, até porque, é o meu anime favorito de longe. Quando se começa a ver esse anime, dá até uma impressão de ser meio infantil, mas essa impressão passa logo, depois de Alabasta, você já tem outro olhar. 
Minha saga favorita é Thriller Bark, e depois Impel Down empatado com Enies Lobby. Eu acho One Piece um anime genial.  
E as aberturas de OP ninguém bate. One Day, We Are, We Go, entre outras. 
One Piece: Para quem não assistiu, recomendo mil vezes!

    Man, where do I start with one piece. This anime is my number one overall and that will never change. The reasoning behind that is just the love I have for one piece. I guess I could also point out that I've been watching this since I was in 3rd grade. One piece started airing in 1999. I started 3rd grade in 2005. I've been watching it for 10 years and still counting! The story is amazing along with the characters. The soundtrack is also great. I know the animation isn't on ufotable's or Madhouse's level but it's good when it needs to be and that's fine. If you ask me if I would recommend this to anybody you bet I would BUT nowadays people are right about the show being too long. So I'd just tell people how awesome it is. If you are gonna watch it then go for it! I will tell you this tho. You definitely WON'T regret watching it.

    You stumbled across this page, because you wondered what is One Piece, but probably, your most important question, that has been poking your mind since some time is: Should I watch it? 
 
Now the basic facts. There are currently 688 episodes aired, and that's probably bit more than half of the planned material Eiichiro Oda (the manga creator) has . To catch up to the current arc you would need to sacrifice around 40 average anime series (or you could do just a lot of different staff in your life, right?). That's more than ten days of constant watching. So how to measure if it's worth it? How to benchmark it? 
 
Before you will read further you need to be totally aware of one thing: the anime is slow, the pacing is awful, more so then ever in the newest arcs. It's like they are trying to squeeze all the money they can from the audience (the Toei animation studio), the same thing that Naruto is currently doing. 
Also, the anime in my opinion, has a pretty much a love/hate relationship going on, and to measure it for yourself, you would need to consider watching around 100-110 episodes. Now if compared to 700 or 1000 it's or even more it's not that bad... 
 
The reason for that, is that the real action begins with the Alabasta Saga (saga consists of few arcs), that starts at episode 62. If the Alabasta Saga won't get your full attention, you will feel forced to stare at the screen etc., dislike this and that, then you should consider dropping  One Piece for your own safety. If, on the other hand, you will find yourself immersed in the anime, waiting impatiently before you can watch the next episode, welcome on the love train.  
 
Also consider this. One thing is to watch anime that has the standard 12-24 episodes (or just a bunch of seasons), another thing is to watch anime that has hundreds of episodes. Obviously, to keep the quality level constant in such big series (or manga series for the fact) is just impossible. If you won't like Alabasta, it will be hard to keep on watching later. Now there are better arcs then Alabasta, but do you want to watch another 100 episodes just to get to them?  
       
All in all, the best way, from the neutral point of view would be just to write down the aspects that create One Piece, make it what it is, and depend on how you respond to them, watch or just leave, it's just as simple as that, having of course in mind what I wrote above: 
•	Humor with mix of goofing around 
•	Slow, bad pacing at times 
•	Long Battles - full shounen style 
•	Good Story that connects all the Sagas 
•	Great Characters with their own personal story (especially the crew) 
•	Many black and white characters, you are either good or bad 
•	Simple, meaningful emotions, that even the youngest audience will understand (especially friendship) 
•	Repetitive at times  
•	Very good voice acting ( I am NOT watching a dubbed version) 
•	Pretty much no death  
•	Just decent music and art even in the newest arcs 
•	Enormous world and enormous amount of characters that you will stumble across your journey 
•	Creativity regarding the laws, history, organizations, countries, buildings (size of some of them is truly astounding) and most obviously all the POWERS the shounen characters get  
•	Predictable at times 
•	Generally, over the top design of many aspects of the manga and anime 
•	Misconception regarding some terms: like pirates, government, marines etc. 
 
Know the author of this simple review is a bit of fan of series, but I tried to stay as objective as possible. So the high score for me is obvious.  
 
Thanks for reading.

    I have been watching one piece for years (This includes re watching the series multiple times) and not once have I regretted watching this show. It has an easy to follow story for those who are of younger age, yet at the same time it can capture an audience of a much older generation. 
 
This is a tale of friendship and dreams. It can inspire people to never give up on those two things which is important, for if you don't have your dreams and your friends then you don't have much of anything. 
 
There are some great fight scenes and  some parts of this show are heart wrenching but the crew always makes it through in the end showing that if you truly believe in something you can do anything. A great message for everyone.

    One Piece is something which can not be explained by words, even though I will try my best to do it. Most people say One Piece get's better as you keep on watching the show, and I totally agree. But there is always a downside to the upside, newbies to the show. We ask all the time when does it get better? When does it get better? The truth is, if you don't like the first 100 episodes give up the show, got it? That's my perspective of this arguement against newbs and fans.  
 
Now, time for the actual review.  
 
Story: One Piece starts off very slow, when it comes to the storyline, but it improves as times go on. The story in One Piece can not be explained in 200 or even 300 episodes unlike some animes. The world is so complex and the story just adds to the world itself. Keep in mind that, One Piece does geniunly excell at story in later episodes, such as my personal favorite, Alabasta Arc! 
 
Art: One Piece is not known because of it's art style. In fact, I would call it mediocre. I don't personally favorite the art style, but it's better than some other animes I have watched. 
 
Sound: The soundtrack for this anime is very good. It provides decent OST's which makes the anime way more exciting and impressive. I want to say though that the soundtracks do get repetitive as time goes on. Each character also has their own music track apparently because of the mid-show cutscenes which depict the character, and their own music which is fun to guess for me. 
 
Character: I don't know how to stress this enough! The character's in this show are off the hook! The charcacter development stems way beyond any other anime or manga I have watched/read. You may become so attached to the characters, you might start hating the villians because you hope they won't sever that connection you have with those characters. 
 
Enjoyment: This anime get's a nine for enjoyment. I know what all of you fans are saying though, ""WTF!??"" and ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!??"" because One Piece deserves a 10. The only reason I put a 9 was because of the starting episodes, and other than that this definitely is pure awesomeness. This world is so enjoyable and so are the characters. In fact, I would say it's easy to get addicted to One Piece! The beginning episodes though, not so much! Some people might say though, that the story is slow-paced, so they don't like it, but the story must be slow-paced in order to explain this magnifecent world! 
 
Overall: One Piece is amazing in it's own ways, but does have flaws in it's own ways too. The pro's outnumber the con's though, but there are still a bunch of cons. This world truly is worth giving a try, but be warned if you don't like the first 100 episodes, just quit! I give this a 9!

    Before I started watching this series, I hated pirates. I thought One Piece looked ridiculous and I refused to watch a show that looked silly and cheesy (like how other animes get super cheesy about friendship). 
 
Now, every one makes fun of me for ever thinking that this show would suck in the first place. I have spent so much money on this shows merch, and I can't even say how many times I have rewatched this show and read the manga. I think about this series 24/7. 
 
Its funny, inspirational, exciting and sad, but mostly what I love One Piece for is its development. It started off as a very simple anime, where everyone was happy and looking towards their goals and the show was very simple to watch. And then it really developed into something more heartwrenching and complicated- I never would have guessed from the beginning of this series how much I would love the characters and how sad it would be, and how much it would make me cry or accidentally hit my head on the wall behind me numerous times cause I get so excited. And if the animation really bugs you, I promise that the art develops too.  
 
And the best thing is, is that all of these tiny hints have been there since the beginning of the series! It's really great noticing something near the start of the show and then realizing much later on how important that small scene was! 
 
I love One Piece to bits- its funny, sweet and yet still has a dark, sad feature to it all. 10/10.

    DISCLAIMER: I am writing this review on episode 850 so I am not 100% up to date but I still want to write it so here it goes. 
 
I am a sucker for long immersive adventure type stories. Being in a massive world with a lot of things happening is something I absolutely love so this anime was frickin made for me. They are also frickin pirates so what more do you want. No but seriously One Piece is a god send and I don't even believe in god.  
 
I am going to go through the ratings one by one and debunk any reasons why people rate them lower and why I disagree with it. 
 
Story: 
 
Eiichiro Oda is an excelent story writer. The One Piece story is immersive, deep, emotional and in my opinion great in all ways. The most important part seems to be making friends and having strong bonds with people which is something I as an introvert am not in contact with that often so I really do love it. 
One thing I will have to say is annoying as hell is the slow progression. Now that I've watched so many episodes and invested a lot of time I am however emotionally attached to the anime and don't want it to end so the slow progression is something I started to like as weird as that sounds. 
But to make it as unbiased as I can I will elaborate what's the problem. The episodes almost always have a 5 minute recap and later they play 2 flippin intros at the start which results in 8 minutes or maybe more of literally nothing. I tend to skip that and what you are left with is about 15 min of an episode. If you are binge watching then you won't notice the episodes are short as hell but if you are watching an episode every 5 days or however they are released it's probably frustrating. That is why I said I kind of like it being very slow. One extreme example was something that was in theory going to happen in 10 seconds went on for 2 full episodes and some would argue that it was 3 episodes. I didn't really mind that because it was fun throughout. There are a lot of filler episodes and a lot of people say you should skip them but I couldn't disagree more.  
WATCH EVERYTHING YOU WON'T REGRET IT. Watch the movies too they are good. 
 
Art: 
 
A lot of people like to complain that the animation and art is not consistent and while I agree that it is noticeable I don't think it's that bad. It's a long ass series you can't expect them to be so spot on. The animation is never bad it's just inconsistent so whatever.  
The early episodes are very old school after all this is a really old anime so you will just have to deal with it if old isn't your shtick.  
 
Sound: 
 
I unironically listen to One Piece soundtracks quite often. Not the openings and endings. Just the soundtrack. I absolutely adore the soundtrack. Maybe it's because I am emotionally attached to them  but they really calm me down or give me energy. They are amazing. No complaints there imo. 
 
Character: 
 
The characters are integral to the story and they are just as good as the story if not better. Character development is amazing since most of the time you get to see how they are now and how they were before so you really see what's happening and again get immersed and involved. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
This is over the roof I am compelled to say One Piece is my fav anime and it deffo is right now.  
 
Overall: 
 
I cried, I laughed. The anime gives a lot of value to freedom and I am a firm believer in freedom. 
It's an emotional roller coaster and it's one of the greatest trips you will ever have watching a series. I highly recommend watching One Piece with all my heart <3

    This is a must watch for any fan of anime. While the length can be off-putting, what you gain is worth it.  
 
Reasons to watch: 
. The world building is second to none and it truly feels like your part of it 
. The characters are all well developed and interesting with great backstories  
. The fight scenes are immense and brutal at times 
. The villains are all interesting with their own individual and pretty original backstories and reasons 
. I don't know if it's just me but i love the soundtrack and honestly think the pre-fight hype songs are the best out there 
. And the best bit it that is doesn't seem like it's ending anytime soon :) 
 
I honestly believe when this does finally end it will go down as one of the best animes/ mangas of all time. It's hard to believe there is still so much we don't know about the world and i cannot wait until all my questions are answered.  
 
Despite all this the first few arcs of One Piece can be quite boring and might not draw you in. However, after that i promise it gets more interesting and you won't be let down. Furthermore, it should be noted that the manga is widely considered better than the anime and if you up for the immense read i'd recommend reading it.  
 
Overall, despite all it's imperfections with some arcs, the charm of this anime is so amazing i cannot recommend it enough if you have the time. 
 
Hope this helped :)

    The first thing anyone who wants to watch One Piece should know(And I'm assuming most do) is that it is quite lengthy, currently clocking in at 905 episodes, with no present sign of stopping. (I'm currently at episode 800, myself) 
 
I think it does a fairly good job of fleshing out characters, giving them their own personal strengths and flaws - like the inability to have any sense of direction, even if they can physically see where they're trying to go; or an irrational obsession with treasure. I don't think it really skimps when it comes to the crew; there's several of them so I think it would be easy for some of them to fall to the wayside. 
 
One thing I enjoy the most about One Piece, is that it tends not to take itself overly serious. That's not to say there aren't tense moments, bits of drama, or whatnot, but it tends to skew a little in the direction of lighthearted. I think Luffy is a great main character, because he tends to act a bit goofy, but still has his own personal idea of what he wants to do as a pirate, and where he desires end up in the world.  He's straightforward and doesn't waver on his target - he protects his crew and works to become King of the Pirates. 
 
I'd recommend anyone who wants to try out One Piece, to at least dedicate themselves to watching the first 'Saga' which ends with episode 61. It would give you a real feel for the story, and have time to suck you in or spit you out.  
 
I would warn anyone that wants to watch this; be wary of burning out watching it. I burned out at episode 791. I think if you're going to watch this, you should stop after every Saga or so, and watch something else, even if briefly, to let what you've seen process and give your brain a break. 
 
All in all, One Piece is my favorite Anime to date, after decades of watching them.

    -SPOILER FREE REVIEW- 
This show is just awesome.It is one of very few anime that i gave 10/10 rating.Every new Story Arc of this show amazes me and leave me astonished.Though there are many scenes that are stretched ,this show still doesn't disappoints you. Every new arc is better than the previous ones and the fillers b/w them are pretty interesting too.In every arc and we get to know about mugiwara pirate's crew backstory or character development.Many people doesn't like this show because it is long and give up half way through and say it is boring.In my opinion one  should decide to watch or drop OP after watching upto impel down arc.The comedy in the show is subtle too and they don't usually forget the plot during fillers too.The whole OP story is connected.They don't even forget 'bout characters and small plots from the past and that is the thing I love most about this show.  
I would recommend this show to every one.

    This is my first review of anything ever and it's fitting that it goes to one of my all-time favourite things ever.  
One Piece is what got me into the manga and anime community, by now everyone has heard about its great world building and I'm not going to go into that because there are better and more informative reviews for that.  
I just want to say as a massive one piece fan who is all caught up with the manga is that every anime and manga fan should watch or read one piece, it deserves all the hype it gets. 
 
Now I know that this review is not at all organized but, there is one fault that I think sticks out. In my opinion, Oda writes all the backstories of the characters from the same template. It could be his style or it could be that he just hasn't realised but all the characters follow the same pattern - as a child, the character went through some trauma and now that trauma affects the said character in some way which defines their worldview.

    Plot: Original plot and storyline. It's easy to follow. There're not a lot of fillers. You can always go to animefillerlist.com if you want to see which episodes are fillers.  It'll make you cry and it'll make you laugh. Just watch it. 
 
Art: Don't judge the anime just on the art. I'm not going to lie, it's a little funky in the beginning. The art gets SO good later on in the series. I'm getting tired of people only watching the first episode and then they go and talk shit about the anime. At least, watch multiple episodes.  
 
Sound: The best voice actors ever. The dub voice actors are really good as well. So if you're the kind of person who prefers dub over sub, then you're in good hands. I can't praise the voice acting enough. 
 
Soundtrack: Really enjoyable music. The openings are so hyped.  
 
Characters: I just love the characters. The characters are so funny and just really enjoyable. You really get into the characters. I rarely find any characters in One Piece annoying. And the character development is pretty good. 
 
Overall: A bomb as anime. Don't hesitate, just watch. This anime will make you cry over a damn ship and it will make you laugh. It's just soooooo good.

    I know it seems weird that I gave this anime 10/10 all across the board, but this anime is beyond just a masterpiece. I started watching this in 2012 because at the time I didn't watch much anime, and I was tired of hating on the most popular anime all the time. When I gave it a try, I got hooked so quick. Every arc you experienced an adventure of a lifetime. Every character seemed to have a story inside them, and with the help of Luffy, they could start screaming it out. If you're looking for a new anime with a breathtaking experience at every turn, you have to watch this one. Literally the greatest adventure you'll ever be on.

    First off, I'd like to cover the thing people seem to hate most about this series.  
The art style. Sure, it's a bit goofy at first, but, the type of cartoonish art allows Oda to convey a variety of expressions and emotions. Also, since he's not stuck drawing characters that look entirely human, it allows him to create unique characters, regardless of how odd they look. If you can't handle the art style, read a summary of the first couple of arcs until the art style improves, and believe me, it has made a huge jump. 
 
Overall, art gets an 8/10 for being original 
 
Let's talk about the sound, as long as you aren't watching the dub, you should be fine. It has good opening and closing themes, but Luffy's English voice is TERRIBLE. However, if you're watching the original Japanese show, the characters voices fit rather nicely I feel.  
 
So, overall, sound gets a 7/10 
 
Characters, oh boy. First of all, I absolutely love Luffy, favorite character in anything by far. But, I digress, if you watch the series in it's entirety, you continue to learn more about the characters, and that isn't just limited to the Straw Hat crew themselves, many characters that play a decently sized role have some kind of backstory to go along with them. Oda just makes every character either lovable, or hate able, and I feel he has done a really good job with the development of characters throughout 
 
Characters, 9/10 
 
Now, we move onto story. Sure, it may seem a bit simplistic at first, but the further you go into the anime/manga, the deeper it delves into the story. The fights are cool, and unlike a lot of shounen anime, the coolest fights are not limited the main character, heck, one of the coolest fights in the series is Zoro against one of the members of CP9, but I won't go into that. Also, the anime is not full of filler, as I see most of the negative reviews saying. Most, if not all of the episodes contribute toward important plot points later on, or at the moment of occurrence. 
 
Story gets a 10/10 
 
Overall, I believe that if you can get through the 1st 100 episodes or so, it'll be smooth sailing. The anime itself is extremely well done. It combines action with a healthy amount of comedy and drama, all the while it stays to the plot, and even manages to maintain it's great writing all throughout the series. Personally, it has been and likely will continue to be my favorite anime. I apologize if this review was at all biased, I tried not to be, and I think I did a decent job. 
 
One Piece is a must watch, and if you can't get past the art style, just read summaries of the arcs and watch highlights until the art style begins to improve (which it doesn't take long to do) 
 
Sorry if the review is bad, I just felt I should write this, even though there are plenty of others here :3

    First of all, One Piece has a terrific storyline that becomes more and more absorbing/thrilling/intricate as it progresses. It's simply stunning how well planned and interconnected the entire series is, despite its length. The characters are diverse and, I personally believe, quite lifelike since they cover a broad range of personality types. Also, they have very moving personal histories that make them very relatable. Plus, the sheer fact that the series is 400 eps long means that eventually, the characters end up seeming so familiar to you, they seem like old friends.  
 
Then there's the creativity of the series' plotline and setting. People make the mistake of assuming it's a generic anime in this respect but any fan could tell you that the show covers a marvelous range of different locations (islands built in the sky, prehistoric islands, desert islands, and more) and that it has several very unexpected plot twists and plot conventions the likes of which are hard to find in other shonen anime. The world of the story (including its unique geography and its zany, but thrillingly powerful inhabitants) is remarkably vast and a treat for the imagination. It's not hard at all for a fan to be utterly swept up in it! There are also several interweaving subplots behind the main goal of the show (which is to find the One Piece treasure) that keep the show alive and fresh (as opposed to, say, Naruto's perpetual quest to save Sasuke). Not to mention, at times, it can be quite mature and meaningful in a poignant, though non-melodramatic way. And the comedy can be just plain hilarious!  
 
As for the show's artwork, this is more controversial since some people simply detest it since they usually find it to be too ""childish"". However for fans of the show the artwork is viewed as being unique and, personally, I feel it captures the adventuring, free-spirited air of the story brilliantly. 
 
Now, to more concisely answer your question, I would have to say what ranks One Piece above other long-running series is its quality. It avoids becoming repetitive, constant attention is given to character development, progress in the plot's development (while slow) is continued constantly, the thematic content is varied and meaningful (it deals with all sorts of issues like greed, corruption, even slavery), its fillers are kept to a minimum and are in fact also rather enjoyable, and it maintains its own unique style. 
 
Just as a warning though, some people find that the first arcs of the show are dull (meaning almost the first hundred eps) and, so, conclude that the entire series must be dull. But really it keeps getting better and better (unlike most long-running series that seem to just sort of tail off in their later episodes). Right now, after 400 episodes, we're reaching what almost all fans promise is going to be the most epic arc to date! So you see, it's really the sort of show that improves with age and can captivate any fan. It just might require some patience in the beginning (though I personally loved it right from the start).

    I've written this out before but just because One Piece is long, doesn't make it a literary flaw!! It has never noticeably tried to artificially lengthen the show and the story has a lot more depth to it than on the surface. 
 
Everyone who is not watching One Piece should be watching One Piece. It is nothing short of a work of genius and while it starts slow, it gets progressively better. I was depressed for a while and it's certainly helped me in those hard times like a crutch. 
 
All the characters are interesting, diverse, and have their own development arcs. It's not just the Luffy Show Staring Luffy, every single member of the crew gets time in the spot light and chances to grow as their own character while also developing unique relationships with one another. And that's not even to mention the wealth of side characters not part of the Straw Hat crew, who ALSO get time to steal the stage in their own right, making it a joy whenever they show up again in later storylines. 
 
This extends to every fight the crew gets in being wonderfully creative and unique. Every single member gets to take a part in the fight, none of that DBZ ""Goku and Goku's family is the only one who matters"", even fucking Usopp gets really awesome battles. And for the most part, the storyline isn't just fights all the time that usually shonen mangas delve into but actually has a great story. 
 
The world and setting is also pretty awesome, with some diversity and complexity to the internal politics and cultural lay out, but the best part is there's not really any part of the series where things just stop dead so someone can have a long exposition scene that's boring and trite. Everything plays out very naturally and the audience is able to pick up on how everything works just by watching it occur in front of them. Also Snail Phones. Cuz Snail Phones. 
 
The series is also incredibly funny, but not to the point of losing credibility. Like, there's some cultural differences, but the manga is genuinely funny and WILL make you laugh. It rival MGS in ability to balance goofy comedy that refuses to take ANYTHING seriously, with legit dramatic moments that will make you choke up. 
 
It has been going on for fifteen or so years, and still has about 7 years to finish, but is still a joy to watching and go along with, and even REWATCHING since it has a habit of bringing back up old characters and plotlines that any other show would have long since forgotten and make them suddenly pivotal and important. It rivals Babylon 5 in apparently having all been planned out from the beginning, or at the very least Breaking Bad in winging it to appear as such. 
 
It is honestly a wonderful incredible show, that unfortunately many people will pass over because of the ""anime = genre"" prejudice, but I feel that those who give it a chance will not regret their choice. Dealing with a variety of times from dealing with lost, happiness, while being the One Piece, I know and love, it's been one of the most influential things I've read.

    A subpar adaption carried hard by excellent source material.  Gets especially bad once Toei starts making intentional terrible pacing of an insanely slow 1:1 episode chapter ratio.  OnePace automatically bumps its back to an 8 however, and the manga was a 9 for reference.  I have a much fuller guide for how to properly read and watch One Piece beyond just watching the official anime below. 
 
For some background, I originally started watching One Piece all the way up to Fishman Island before I was even a general anime fan but lost interest until a year ago when I decided to just sit down and binge all of it again, finally finishing my year's journey with chapter 929 yesterday. I've noticed that there are 5 routes to read or watch One Piece with between the manga, anime, and derivative projects. 
 
Manga Routes-generally reads faster (very important for a 900+chapter/800+episode behemoth) and has more bonus material spread throughout 
 
    Official Manga (black and white)-the final route if you want to stay up to date but not necessarily the beginning route especially when there's a Colored Manga route available 
 
    Colored Manga-my most used route personally and what I used to just power through the beginning, a strict improvement over Official (color>B&W) but only extends partially into Whole Cake Island 
 
Anime Routes-generally has higher high moments and is more passively consumed 
 
    Official Sub-generally fine for PART I, since you can skip filler arcs 
 
    Official Dub-see above, for those that jsut prefer all english and no reading 
 
    OnePace-cuts filler AND padding, essential for re-correcting Part II of the anime when Toei goes full scum mode 
 
Unfortunately all of these routes have different lengths with some ending before other parts so there are different paths mix-matching these routes. I've highlighted three paths in particular for those with a preference towards manga or anime as mediums or those that want the absolute best of both worlds. 
 
 
 
MANGA ONLY PATH 
 
    Chapters 001-833: Colored Manga 
 
    Chapters 834+: Official Manga 
 
 
 
MAXIMAL ANIME PATH 
 
    East Blue-Marineford: Official Sub/Dub (skip the fillers, OnePace isn't finished yet here) 
    Return to Sabody-Whole Cake Island (1st half): OnePace Whole Cake Island (second half)+: Official Manga, because OnePace hasn't covered this part yet. 
 
 
 
OPTIMIZED HYBRID PATH (warning: wall of text) 
 
 
PART I 
 
    East Blue Saga-Any route that gets the job done, just to get over the archive panic and start 
 
    Alabasta Saga-Any is fine 
 
    Skypiea Saga-Any is fine, use Official Sub/Dub route's conclusion if you want G8 tho 
 
    G8-Optional good filler arc?! Official Sub/Dub routes only as a result 
 
    Foxy-Colored Manga, its a gag manga arc that gets padded out way too much 
 
    Water 7-An anime route is slightly preferred for density of high moments 
 
    Ennies Lobby-An anime route is slightly preferred for density of high moments 
 
    Thriller Bark-An anime route is favored for musical impact 
 
    Sabody Archipelago-An anime route is favored as an actually good adaption 
 
    Amazon Lily-Colored Manga, really short and anime does nothing for adaption besides making it longer to finish 
 
    Impel Down-An anime route is slightly preferred for density of continuity moments 
 
    Marineford-Offical Sub/Dub slightly preferred for moment/continuity density, as OnePace is not finished recutting this arc 
 
 
PART II: Toei becomes scumbags and start only adapting 1 chapter per episode, making Official Sub/Dub routes inviable, leaving OnePace as the only viable anime route. The Colored manga route is still perfectly viable however. 
 
    Return to Sabody-OnePace AND Official Sub route for brook's concert scene specifically 
 
    Fishman Island-Colored Manga; its a great arc for its themes w/ bad action scenes anyways 
 
    Punk Hazard-OnePace, Law's whole gag works so much better w/ voice acting 
 
    Dressrosa-OnePace OR Colored Manga, its a 50 episode/100 chapter behemoth, just do what you have to do to power through this arc whether it's speed or passiveness 
 
    Zou-OnePace is slightly favored, if only for Brook's song 
 
    Whole Cake Island (1st half) OnePace is strongly favored, between the color and musical numbers of the very colorful and very musical whole cake island 
 
 
PART II.5: You've reached the end of the OnePace route and the Colored Manga Route is long over too and neither update particularly fast (Official Dub route is over too but was already irrelevant). There are only two routes remaining: Official Sub and the Original Manga route. Official Sub still suffers from Toei's greed and Original Manga is the final destination anyways, so I recommend just jumping onto the Official Manga sooner than later. 
 
    Whole Cake Island (2nd half)-Official Manga, color/music isn't worth the Official Sub route's pacing 
 
    Reverie and beyond-Official Manga, it is literally the only route left, welcome to the final destination and now you can be up to date every week too

    While i would without a doubt give manga 10 out of 10, anime just doesn't deserve such generosity.  
You know that something is wrong, then your anime looks much, MUCH better during episode 300 than during ~700. I guess Toei realised that they don't need to pump any money into this, kids will still watch it- so we have a miserably bad animation (ironically, the best animated scenes are these where characters are just talking, any movement, especially backgrounds, looks embarassing at best) and annoying reuse of sound effects... You laughed at CLANG from berserk? One Piece STILL uses Dragon Ball Z sound effects! 
 
Bad animation alone wouldn't be much of a problem, if the story was good, right? And it is- if you look at the entire arc. Single episodes are boring as f*** unless you skip through them.  
Every episodes starts at time of 6:00 and ends at 22:00. Subtract 20s of eyecatcher, another minute of camera slowly moving through ugly backgrounds and another one minute of reused scenes from previous episides and you end up with each episode lasting maybe 14-15 minutes. And even this is stretched as much as Toei can, with dozens of characters reacting to every mc actions and filler fights. 
 
Most episodes cover a single, 18-pages long chapter. Even other long-running series, like Bleach or Naruto, used to cover at least 2 chapters. But i said ""MOST"", because there are some that cover... less. Imagine entire episode based on, let's say 10 pages, that you could read under 8 minutes. Stretched to a full episode! That's a regular OP episode. 
 
Watching one piece without skipping is painfull, but hopefully there are still some fairly good episodes, every now and then (i somehow watched through entire Law's past without skipping a second). Also, the material anime is adapting is outstandingly good, even if this hideous cartoon would suggest otherwise. 
 
Something went really, really wrong with this anime. I mean, it used to be better- not only the animation peaked during Ennies Lobby/Summit War, but also anime used to cover at least 1 chapter per episodes (and sometimes- it's actually enough). But nowadays watching one piece is just exhausting- for example, Dressrosa Arc lasted for 100 chapters in the manga... and 120 in the anime! Whole cake- 80 v 100!  
I simply can't imagine the torture of watching it weekly, in front of tv, for full 30 minutes. I'd forgot what all was about before Dressrosa could end... 
 
But there's a simple explanation to it all- the manga counterpart. Obviously, Eichiro Oda is a god of mangamaking, and each volumes sells in millions. Also One Piece airs on sunday morning, next to a freaking dragon ball and other kid's favourite shows. Of course millions will watch it ANYWAYS, so Toei doesn't have to spend more than, i guess, ""enough"". They do not have to compete with other series. And Toei knows it- they know that if they aired more than 4 episodes of filler in a row, less would watch it (and sadly, some filler were pretty fun). That's why they decided to move at such a slow pace, because even showing one minute of new content is enough to attract millions of people in front of TV... 
 
But hopefully animation slightly increased in recent episodes. But OP anime is still a shadow of its former self.

    I am tired of one piece anime.  
 
The lazy animators, the broken gestures of characters, and the robotic animation in the fight scenes, and mostly the slow story development.  I like one piece, but since its already 2 decades had past, but the story are still in the middle, I'm bored of it and get tired. The author skips the story of the characters that is likable and need to be told like ""Shanks"" mihawk"" reyleigh"" and many more. Its been a decade since they are being introduced in the series but we still cant figure out their origin and backgrounds, we only knew few things about them. As the story goes on, the author keeps adding countless characters and makes you confused (I know some of them are likable), the bad thing is the added characters have given a role that surpass the previous supporting characters. What I mean is, the old characters that has been added in previous arcs are being forgotten and the new characters plays a role that surpass the old characters. 
 
(POWER UPS) 
As we know luffy is a robber man who eat the cursed fruit. He is also the successor of the emperrors haki. The problem is, In the present chapters, He is now able to use different kind of powers, example the ""Fire fist"". How the hell is he able to manipulate fire? . second is the ""4th GEAR"", How the hell is he transformed into a rocket looking thing?  and why the hell he become a spring man? (I cant figure the relation of robber and spring and the rocket looking transformation).  
 
The most thing I hate in the animation is, my favorite characters Nami and  Robin, looks like a old macho men, why the hell they have large nick and broken face gestures? (Damn ""TOEI"" what the fuck are you doing?)  how can you call them a gorgeous lady now that you broke their faces? 
 
I'm really disappointed in this series, I wasted my whole 10 years of life being a fan for this nonsense and endless story of a show. 
 
There's a lot more to talk to, but that is for now, Because  I still hoping for the improvement of the series. 
 
Maybe its time to hold this series for now.

    When I first heard about one piece I was nearly overflown with the hype the fans were giving it, saying it was the best thing ever, that anyone who dares to call themselves an anime fan should at the very least reconsider watching it, or either the haters would complain that this 600+ series has been pushing themselves forward way to long and just need to end already. 
I gave this series a try, evenually I got hooked up so bad, I watched the entire series in just a spawn of 3 months,  
and all I got to say about it is, I absolutely love it.  
don't even doubt about the fact whether you want to watch this show or not, watch this show right now, this instant.  
one piece is literally for anyone out there, children, teens, adults, male, and even female may enjoy it undoubtely. one piece is one of the best shounens out there, and has all his right to earn this title.  
 the writers succeed in knitting this long running story so well together that it just fits perfectly. 
every introduced character plays it's part, everything that happens has a value, may it be momental, huge or even way later in the future of the show.  
this show doesn't understand the concept of exaggerating, may it be of the wacky character personalities, designs, the downright crazy devil fruit powers, wacky islands, inhuman myths and introduces you to crossdressers, mermaids, fishmen and giants in the show like it's the most normal thing ever.  
 
characters:  
the characters in one piece most definitely has to be one of it's strongest points.  
the main characters are so well developed that it's impossible to hate any straw hat pirate.  
from the easy-minded but pure hearted rubber captain ,Monkey D luffy, to the headstrong loyal swordsmen ,roronoa zoro, from the wimp sniper ,usopp who later slowly but surely develops in a dependable and strongwilled crewmember,  
 the characters which are introduced in the spawn of the series surely aren't left out either.  
one piece expands from a variety of all different kinds of characters and backstories which all in all are unique on their own, from the way they speak, laugh, how they behave, their ideals, every character is memorable and they own carry their own value to the evenual story. 
 
art: 
though,  I gotta confess  that I honestly had to get used to the art of one piece at first. 
the mouths were way to weird for me, the females were way to thin, and some features seemed to be rather bad. 
after a few episodes it just eventually stopped bothering me, after you got used to it you don't even know why you would dislike it in the first place. it's just another segment to make one piece more unique and if you're in the story more deeper you end up simply enjoying it.  
I can understand that some people don't have the ability to get used to it, but don't let it bother you one bit. you won't regret it. 
 
Music:  
it ain't yuki kajiura material, but it also isn't necessairy. the music fits in the background of one piece just perfectly, some BGM are memorable and just downright beautiful/epic. 
everytime I listen to the soundtrack used for a sad moment in enies lobby arc I start sobbing again.  
 
enjoyment: 
one piece is one of the best series I have ever watched in my life, out of all the anime I've watched, this most definitely is my favorite. 
it's unique, enjoyable, it makes you push your nose against the screen in the exciting moments, it succeeds to make you sob in the sad moments, 
this series is most certaintly a long one, and hasn't dried out in the least bit, and also won't be up until the very end. 
do you need to watch one piece? hell yeah you do.  
and why: because you're missing out of a whole lot, if at the very least you don't wanna reconsider watching this masterpiece.

    One Piece is story about a boy who wants to be the Pirate King. The boy's name Monkey D. Luffy. On his adventure he finds amazing crew mates with sad pasts. Everyone in Luff's crew also has dreams. To accomplish their dreams they cross the Grand Line, meet people, & fight for their amazing dreams! They all will fight for their dreams until they die! While you watch this anime you shouldn't care about the art, voices, etc. because this anime is an anime that will encourage you to go on with your ambitions, fight for friends & families, and & to NEVER GIVE UP! This is what I know so far & I hope for you watchers to keep watching this anime till the very end.This anime is sad, romantic (if don't understand what that means just watch all of the episodes), funny, exciting, heart breaking, and AMAZING. I am chrischo718 and I approve this message!!!

    Without going into spoilers too much I will give my review of One Piece. 
 
Characters and Story 
The story revolves around the main protagonist Monkey D Luffy who aims to become the king of the pirates. And along with him will be the other Straw Hat members who you will meet as you go along the series. The main cast for One Piece is pretty good as they have unique personalities from each other as well as their own fighting styles, powers and abilities. They also got some good backstories which can make you feel and care about them. What they do lack however is development because Luffy does not really have any throughout the series even though he does have a very likable personality and the others only seem have quite a bit of development within the arcs they are introduced in. The side characters you meet within the arcs are good as they may have some good backstories and do develop. The villains are not bad either since they can have an interesting personality and backstory however they kinda lack something which makes you believe whether they actually pose as a real threat to the straw hats and I should state that there isn't a lot of deaths in One Piece which lowers the sense of danger a bit. As for the story it does really well as it has a deep story with many subplots to them which relates to the world building which is also great that comes from within the arcs with the islands they explore as they also go into some themes. Plus there are not a lot of plot holes or inconsistencies so it is well written for the most part. Now if I were to belittle One Piece's story I could say that there is this plot formula which goes like this ""Luffy and crew goes to island, they become friends with a few residents there, have a decent understanding of what goes on within the island, villain starts wreaking havoc, Luffy and crew beat the villain and happy ending, then they go to a new island, rinse and repeat"". However that does not change the fact that One Piece has a great plot. Also I should mention that One Piece does have slow pacing so within the grand scheme of things, there might not be that much progression as the anime usually does 1 chapter per episode and it is apparently halfway through the story although I believe its more 2/3. 
 
Action 
One Piece has some pretty nice fights and the better ones usually come from Luffy, Zoro and Sanji. The animation usually moves fines for it and has some good sound effects for it. Also there is a huge variety of abilities within One Piece and they can get pretty creative with the devil fruits, haki and other techniques as well as some fighting styles. I wouldn't say they have the best fights in anime but that's all subjective and go around with it how you will. 
 
Comedy 
The comedy in One Piece is very good as the show does have this overall lighthearted tone which mainly comes from its comedy and it goes well. I also would like to say that One Piece does well to balance the tone between comedy and seriousness. 
 
Sound 
The soundtrack for One Piece is solid because it really does make it feel like a pirate theme adventure. So don't expect some rock or techno within One Piece's soundtrack. The sound effects for One Piece are great with the attacks, motion, etc. 
 
Art style and Animation 
At first the art style would seem very childish and silly, however you will eventually get use to it and even start to appreciate it since the art style is unique and anime for the most part has a similar art style. The animations are fine, don't expect something like Madhouse quality animation because since its a very long series, they won't have enough budget to make all the episodes top notch so its fine for what it is. And it can be very good in some scenes. 
 
Overall Conclusion 
One Piece is a very good series that is worth getting into. Its not perfect and has some flaws but the since there is a lot to like in One Piece, the positives outweigh the negative so they won't be much of a bother for the overall experience. Although I would say it is better to marathon the series rather than watch it weekly as I have stated the pacing is slow so not much would happen if you are watching weekly.

    One Piece is one of the greatest things I've ever experienced. it is without doubt my favorite anime/manga. It has amazingly interesting and cool characters and a seemingly simple but grand plot. One of the things that I love about it are the characters. Some are just quirky but  many others are very well written and interesting. One Piece has an extensive variety of good characters that just make the whole One Piece universe even better than it already is. I could go for hours thinking about different battles that could have happened in different arcs between different characters that would have completely changed the series. My favorite character is Doflamingo and he is really cool because he is crazy and he just doesn't care about anything but his goals which is really awesome.  
Another great thing about One Piece is the artwork. I like the artwork because it is a very good at most parts. The first 500 episodes have good art but after that it gets kinda messed so I would recommend reading the manga after that point.  
Another great aspect of One Piece is its music. When something is going down with Luffy a really epic song will play and it will get you really hyped for the coming battle. Just thinking about these songs gives me chills because of what was going on when they were playing. It also has very good openings and endings that are amongst the best I've heard. 
One Piece's story is seemingly simple: Luffy is searching for the One Piece. It is not as simple as it seems though. Each arc has its own unique theme, appeal, and characters. each arc immerses you into that islands world and keeps you very entertained. Also each arc builds up on the last one to make a very grand story. 
With all these things combined it makes One Piece have something special that I have yet to see in anything else anime, TV series, and movies.

    At the risk of losing all my readers, let's start with some math. Four hundred and fifty episodes, roughly thirty minutes each, comes out to 13,500 minutes, with some generous rounding. There are 1,440 minutes in a day, meaning that would take over nine days to catch up to the latest episode of One Piece if you start from episode one and never sleep. It takes some extreme dedication to get that far; such dedication that, in fact, it should pointless to ask me what I thought of the series. The numbers can't lie: I loved it. I have dedicated half a year of my free time between work and High School to this anime, and it was consistently one of the highlights of my week. I don't think you should just go watch One Piece; I think you should go watch One Piece right now. I have joined a large chorus of fans and writers online who will all tell you with the zeal of a cultist that this series is awesome. This is the creme de la creme of shounen series, it has reached the zenith of what anime can do several times over, if you even think you can make the time to see this, you must at least try. And our voices are so loud and so strong... 
 
... that a perfectly natural reaction from someone who hasn't seen this series, or has seen some of it and didn't care to continue, is skepticism. After all, I'm talking about a cartoon about a rubber pirate who acts like he's five years old. It's essentially just another shounen fighting series for 11-year-olds; it hardly seems like the Citizen Kane of anime. Hyperbole in the name of exuberance can have the odd effect of putting people off, and spending over hundred hours on anything requires a lot of exuberance. That skepticism is understandable, especially since explaining what makes this series work might not sound all that different from why people enjoy Bleach, Naruto, or similar series. 
 
So let's start with something we can all agree on- visually and conceptually, One Piece is a unique series. Anime is littered with ghost hunters, ninjas and teenagers endowed with mystical powers inspired Eastern mythology, but Oda hit on something special when he came up with the idea of 17th century pirates with superpowers. And that's really the beginning of One Piece's creativity. For such a long series, a constant flow of creativity is a must, and Oda has generally shown that he is up to the challenge. One of the conceits of the series is that each island the characters travel to is a strange world unto itself. One island could be under the thumb of tyrannical mermen, another a mystical island where it always snows, and still another where all the plants and animals have grown to be really l o n g. It's wonderful world building, but not in the sense that it's carefully crafted like Fullmetal Alchemist. It's more like a child's glee at making things up as she goes along. Unlike most shounen series, where superpowers and wonders have some kind of pseudoscientific explanation, the series follows an unrelenting dream logic that it doesn't explore very deeply. Why does eating a fruit that gives you superpowers also mean you can never swim? It just does, dammit. It's a refreshing change, and it keeps the sense of wonder intact for many episodes. 
 
Take the superpowers our heroes wield. Luffy is a kid who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, and now is a rubber man: literally, a man made of rubber. That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in One Piece, it's a potent power that leads to some crazy, awesome, and crazy awesome fights. He can take a lot of damage, and since his rubber fists and feet can stretch to huge lengths, he can give as good as he takes. One of the main villains, Buggy, ate the Chop Chop Fruit, so he can divide his body however he pleases. And there are many more, and for over three hundred episodes, we are constantly introduced to wave after wave of new characters with strange abilities that range from the silly to the sinister, and, sometimes, are even both at the same time. And one of the small delights of the series is that when our heroes get strong by developing their powers, they break from the shounen formula of ""defeat - training - victory."" No, the characters develop their skills on the fly- they make it up as they go along. This burst of creativity lasts so long and is so strong, that when the anime does finally bring back some old characters beyond the core cast, it's a bit of a disappointment. 
 
Of course, for the series to be any kind of success, these characters would have to be better than your garden variety heroes. They'd have to be characters you could care deeply about and watch develop beyond what crazy things their powers do. Luffy can't become the Pirate King by himself, so he brings along a ragtag group of people he befriends in his travels. Though the small crew keeps adding new characters, there's roughly five core members: Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While you could safely describe each of these characters by whatever their particular kook is- Sanji is the cook who loves the ladies, Nami is the domineering navigator who loves money, Zoro is the samurai swordsman who wields three blades and sleeps all the time, Usopp is the sniper who tells outrageous lies- but that doesn't quite do them justice. They develop and grow close to each other, reinforcing the anime's central theme of friendship. The cast is probably One Piece's greatest strength, because when the story lags and things slow down, it's still a pleasure to spend time with the Straw Hats. I would hold them up to any of the great crews of anime, from Lupin, Urusei Yatsura, or Cowboy Bebop. And save a kind word for the villains: after all, what's a good hero without one or a dozen great enemies? They are all hateful bastards who deserve to get their face smashed in. It's a delight to see it happen every time. 
 
The concept of One Piece is very open ended; ""Boy tries to be the Pirate King"" leaves a lot of room open for how that could happen. Appropriately enough for a series about a long odyssey, the series has been leisurely working its way towards an ending. So far, the anime has covered about five major story arcs, some of which have several mini arcs. It starts out with short, mostly silly stories that are quickly resolved, but as we get to know the characters more and the world opens up, it gradually, confidently builds towards high drama with some epic storylines. Two examples stand out: the Alabasta Arc and the CP9 Saga. The Alabasta Arc starts shortly after the core of the crew is assembled and spans over fifty episodes. It's a big, meaty storyline with conspiracies and secret identities, rebellions and politicking, and has one of the most effective villains I've ever seen in anime. It's only topped many episodes later, with the epic CP9 Saga. This one spans a hundred episodes and is a more emotional viewing, and it's where the Straw Hats show the most growth. 
 
I really mean it when I say One Piece has the elusive ""spirit of anime."" As a series, the serialized storytelling has a lot of impact that builds from episode to episode, and shows extensive planning for arcs a couple hundred episodes in advance. It's one of the few series that can only be realized in animated form, and it has so much impact because of its extreme length. And it may be nowhere near finished. When recently asked how close the manga was towards completion, which the anime sticks very close to, Oda estimated that he was about halfway finished. And while he's known to be a jokester in interviews, I don't know of any reason not to take his answer at face value. And while recent episodes haven't quite lived up to the same level as earlier, since Oda has started to dip more often into the pool of Shounen Jump cliches, it says a lot that my reaction to this news was happiness. 10/10

    Note:This review is based on the original Japanese dub not the English dub. 
 
This is one of those shows that require no introduction but just in case you do need one. The show centers around the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and his crew and the adventures that they go on so that they can each accomplish their dreams and goals. It is one of the many few shonen anime that can keep my attention and keep me engaged and excited for the next episode.   
 
Story 9/10 
The story might seem very simple on the surface, but as you get further into the anime, the show begins to show layers with many themes of friendship, trust, loss, and many different things that drive the show. The story really has many layers that can't necessarily be explained by words,so i'll leave judgment of story up to the viewers, but in my opinion the story isn't the only thing that makes this show amazing.  
 
Characters 10/10 
I believe that One Piece has an amazing diverse cast of characters with most if not all characters being able to be well developed in the amount of time that they get. All the characters are memorable, lovable, and outright very well developed. Enough so that they make me actually care for each character that is introduced. The characters truly make up the world and really push the enjoyment factor so high I wish I could rate it higher.  
 
Art 7/10 
Due to this being a weekly shonen show with many many episodes the animation is bound to have its ups and downs, but when the animations shines it really shines and when it doesn't, it shows.  
 
Sound 9/10  
The music and voice acting of this show is amazing. I can't tell you how many times I will hum one of the many opening songs or instrumental pieces while I'm outside. There are some times when I don't really like some of the voices of some characters but that is just from my own personal opinion.  
 
Overall 10/10 
There are some flaws that I have not mentioned but I believe that this show overshadows all those flaws with it's amazing world, fantastic cast of characters, and amazing storytelling. I would recommend One Piece to anyone. One Piece really is in my opinion a truly amazing anime.

One Piece is the first anime that I really liked. Yes, its your typical shounen anime with shounen tropes but at least it tries to be somewhat unique (unlike Naruto, Bleach ,or DBZ). Not in a Generic School Setting YES! (Fuck anime that are set in schools), A series about Pirates (Original). I am tired of anime with ninjas/samurai (though they are really cool). I am tired of anime that has a student main character (eww) and luckily I found One Piece. 
 
Story and Setting: 9/10 
Its not original but One Piece has one of the best, if not the best storytelling, in anime. It is formulaic but the way every single arcs are told are very compelling and unique that it feels different to your typical shounen. It is also connected to one another (Even G8, a filler arc was well connected). The flashbacks are all well done almost have of One Piece flashbackas are in my Top 10 Flashbacks (for now at least). The mysteries induced in the story are very intriguing and just mindblows the hell out of me. For a shounen, One Piece is somewhat unpredictable. The worldbuilding/setting is just top-notch. Oda is just super imaginative and creative. Easily the best part of One Piece. It may go very slow at times (especially at weekly basis) but the interest is never lost. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
All characters are likeable (except for few). The main villains in the series are all well done. They are intimidating, have awesome backstories that make them more interesting. The sense of danger with them is really evident. The main characters are all interesting, especially on how they develop throughout the story. Overall they are very likeable, relatable and interesting. 
 
Overall I consider One Piece to be the second best SHOUNEN (behind Hunter x Hunter) anime I have watched (if FMA:B is shounen then One Piece is 3rd).

FIGHTS: 8/10 (Gets more weight because of how great the story is)

    ""If I get reincarnated.... I wanna become a clam."" - Monkey D. Luffy"" 
 
I often see people pushing away and refusing to try One Piece because it's ""mainstream"" and very long. I am sad to see such a nice series being refused just because it's popular, it's long, the art, or because of the dubbed version.  
 
Story: With Pirates, superpowers, giants, and many more things, it is different from what I've seen in other anime. Sure, there are many other series about Pirates, or superpowers, but this combines everything into one long series. Sad moments that make you want to cry, some moments you cry of laughter, anxiously waiting for the next episode to see how everything plays out. 
 
Art: The art of One Piece has always been nice. It is bright and lively. Beautiful details, beautiful backgrounds, etc.. 
 
Sound: I am not one to overly enjoy the soundtrack on an anime, but One Piece was different. Each opening have been upbeat, refreshing, and nice to listen to. It was also nice when they doubled the beginning, and took the ending song out. The Japanese voice acting fits perfectly for each character you meet throughout the series. 
 
Character: You meet many, many characters in One Piece. Every one you meet, minor, major, enemies, friends, they all have their own style. Most characters will make an impact, and you will be remembering them a while after they leave.  
 
Enjoyment: I enjoy each and every episode, anticipating new episodes every Sunday. This show comes with lots of heart-warming moments, many surprises, and hilarious moments. 
 
Overall: One Piece was a very enjoyable series. I would recommend to anyone who likes action, fights, and humor.

    One Piece is awesome! One of my most memorable moment was in the early episodes when Luffy got hypnotized and he started yelling in anger, and I thought the voice was so perfect absolutely hilarious.  Thats how I got hooked.   
 
My main reason why I like One Piece so much is simply because there is so many episodes.  Since I was new to One Piece early december of 2007, I did alot of watching in my spare time. It felt great, every episode I would get more attached and I didnt want it to stop. I'm kinda heartbroken having to wait a week for a new episode, since i fell in love watching 20 episodes a day. 
 
I like the fact one piece has everything, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Romance, Mystery, Drama, Suspense and SAKE! 
 
One piece is brilliant.

    Well One Piece is my most favorite anime. 
I waited this anime to be release every week with no delay, course to display how i like this anime. 
Cause even though the story is super-duper long running the story line were all connected. 
and what's more wonderful were the how the characters improving to become the best.  
Not just the characters are the one whose improving, even the drawings that put here were improving to. 
from plan 2d to amazing anime. 
So I rate this anime perfect. 
 
I think this anime is should be a ""default anime to be liked"" 
 
But why the one piece episode list here were outdated. 
by the time i write this review it should be episode 722, yet its still on ep. 715. 
Gosh...

    Let me just start off with saying this: if you need 750+ episodes and your story isn't even halfway over, you're a s*** writer. NO EXCUSES ODA. I've invested sooooo much time into the series but I'll be damned if I don't some day get a time machine so take it all back and do something productive with my life. 
 
Story: 2/10 - it's so ridiculously repetitive you'll want to cry. Protagonists go to island, island has some shit going on and the straw hats have to basically destroy the entire underground criminal organization of each freaking island, whether they just be lowly criminals terrorizing the city or the entire government of the island is corrupt. I understand that the Straw hats are the ""good guys"" but do they really have to overthrow the monarchy of every freaking island they land on I mean Jesus Christ. 
 
Characters: 3/10 - Each character has some tragic backstory and seem important until they just fade into the background of the straw hat crew because of Oda's complete inability to add any sort of profound depth to his characters. They are all the same as day 1, and they cling to the same annoying cliches even after they've been burned to the ground. Hey you know how brook is a skeleton? Ya let's make him say 50 million skull jokes it's not like those got old after the second time. Hey you remember how bad Zoro was with directions for the first 100 or so episodes? No? Well now he randomly can't walk straight without getting lost. Franky became considerably more lame after the time skip, personality and design wise, and as for the rest of the straw hats they are just ""OK"".  
 
Drama/realisim: (SPOILERS) -100/10 - Alright, do you guys remember when that bird dude took a f***ing nuke to the face and walked it off like it was nothing? That was pretty cool. Or how about when Doflammingo shot the living s*** out of trafalgar law after beating the crap out of him and piercing his chest multiple times and then we see him just a few episodes later with just a few scratches and bruises? Or how about when Jimbe got his f***ing organs obliterated by akainu and then lived to tell the tale like it was nothing? What about when Robin blew up igoram's ship in a HUGE pillar of fire and he returned to alabasta and we never even got an explanation as to what happened, he was just fine! Has a bomb even killed a single person in the series yet? Probably not, and that's pretty impressive considering taking a bomb to the face is like a daily ritual to these people. No matter who you are, civilian or hero; you will inevitably get blown up and be perfectly fine at some point in the series. What the f*** Oda, are all of your characters made out of adamantium or something? Since we know that Oda's a lil b**** who never kills anyone if it doesn't progress the story, this leads to a lot of ""Fake"" drama in the series. We know that even though that dude just got his face shot in by the evil guy, he's gonna be a-okay. This becomes downright insulting after the 500th time it happens. I know it's really only natural to worry about the safety of your friends after they've just been curb stomped into oblivion, but since no one ever dies in series, it makes you not care. This is not drama, it's just an overused cliche that the writers still think they can milk and get away with and it's lazy. 
 
sound: 5/10: nothing exceptional about it but it's okay. 
 
animation: 2/10: it sucks.  
 
Conclusion: If I could go back in time and tell younger me to just stick a fork in the outlet instead of watching this show, I would do it in a heartbeat. Do not recommend, would rather have robin gouge eyes out while nami repeatedly sticks me with the clim-atacck while brook tells more more stupid skeleton jokes until I die.

    (No spoilers contained, and sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language + i'm still amateur on writting reviews) 
 
One Piece is one of the most popular anime/manga series. But i have to say that the manga is way better than the anime for sure. Not because of the few filler episodes, but for the slow pacing, which became more obvious in the recent years and the mediocre animation. But let's go further. 
 
Story: 9 
The story is about Luffy who wants to become the king of pirates. He and his nakama, sail across the Grand Line to fulfil their dreams/goals.  The story is simple, BUT you will see thousands of characters, different events, battles, sad-epic-happy moments. And that is what makes One Piece story more unique than other shounen series. There are some filler episodes, but it is a small amount of them. 
 
 Art: 7 
Despite the very mediocre animation, the art is good and it fits One Piece.  There is no CGI, and the animation does get better throughout the series, but still, for the year of 2015, the animation is like being in 2003.  Also, compared to the manga, the animation is childish. Anyway, the art is unique again, but here the unique is not that good. 
 
Sound: 8 
The voice actors fit perfectly every One Piece character. The backround music also fits the atmosphere, and the content of the soundtrack is big. It rarely uses some soundtracks, and some of them can be listened in almost every episode. It's not the best content of soundtracks you'll hear, but they are the best for One Piece. 
 
Character: 10 
This is what makes One Piece one of the best series of all time. Unique characters with their own backstories, awesome villains, both the main and secondary characters are amazing, and the secondary characters support the series in a great way. The motivations of the villains and their backstories will give you the thrills. Plus, the character develpoment of the main characters throughout the series is amazing. New fighting techinques, new relationships etc.. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
There are definetely many episodes ( currently there are almost 720 episodes) and sometimes there is some low pacing( especially in the past 2-3 years) and many of the arcs are huge (like 40+ episodes) but the story NEVER gets boring. 
 
Overall: 8 
If you are a shounen fan, then One Piece is for you. Maybe not the best shounen anime out there, especially if you don't like an anime with so many episodes and somekind of childish content ( almost no blood in scenes where in the manga there is blood) but still, a popular anime with many fans. It is my favourite anime, but definetely not the best i've watched. By the way, don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that One Piece is for children, it's just that many scenes are censored, for no reason. 
Thank you for reading!

    To tell you my truth all i can say is this is the kind of anime that takes its time to tell you the story, it really wants you to understand whats going on and not miss any detail of whats going on. One of the main characters is luffy he is the kind of person who enjoys almost everything and is laid back but somehow is really serious and if one of his friends get in danger he will risk it all to save them. All the characters get there time to shine too and they all get stronger over the story's time line that is really the best thing of this anime i enjoy. This is my first review so it isn't going to be that long or great but this is truly what i think of this anime ;)

    Before we begin, I would like to say that One Piece is an amazing series, I really love it. The anime had it's moments but the majority of the show was a drag. 
 
One Piece is a series well deserving of it's praise, but it's been tainted by the horrible 4Kids, not to mention the anime adaptation isn't even that good. 
 
Story-One of the most enjoyable parts of One Piece, is the story it tells, the adventures and many unique islands the Straw Hat Crew travel. It's entire universe is unique and interesting from interesting designs in it's universe and even carries it on to it's characters. (Sadly there are quite a few females who tend to look alike though) 
The world of One Piece is amazing, the world building aspect is another thing One Piece shines in. 
 
Art-This one I'm not too sure about the art looks okay, until later on in the series the art gets better. The thing that holds this back is the animation. It's so poor considering it's the best selling manga of ALL TIME. This is Toei Animations fault. It feels so sluggish, and the fight scenes sometimes are at least decent. I don't have any idea what Toei is thinking, or doing with the budget for a popular series like One Piece, but the animation is pretty bad. 
 
Sound- The voice actors for the series are good and match the characters well, and bring emotion to the story. (I don't recommend the english Funimation dub though some characters voices are okay, but others aren't good. The original japanese is better) 
The sound effects are cheap though and don't sound good. Yet another complaint. 
 
Characters-Another aspect of One Piece that is very well done. The characters, even the minor ones are really enjoyable. They each have their own personalities and their own development and fleshed out backstories. One huge example of this is the character Senor Pink. He's not important to the story nor does he appear besides a few chapters in an arc. Yet the characters are fleshed out and have their own relationships with characters across the series and experiences with them, backstories and everything isn't a pain to go through, except in the anime adaptation. The anime makes experiencing One Piece extremely slow. 
 
Enjoyment-Oh I enjoyed One Piece so much, but sadly the anime's HORRIBLE pacing makes the experience a pain in the ass. I did enjoy the series at first it wasn't too bad, but it just steadily got worse. REALLY bad. I do have a decent tolerance level for this, but this...it was just too much. It was slow, not to mention at some points the animation was bad and slow, which didn't help keep my eyes glued to the show. 
 
Verdict-One Piece is amazing. However this anime adaptation is not. It's painfully slow, the animation is definitely on the lower end of the scale considering it's the bestselling manga of all time, though it has redeeming qualities, I really liked some of the OP's which ironically some openings had better animation than the show itself, and the show had it's moments which I actually enjoyed, but a few moments of a 800+ series? I'm sorry that's not enough to redeem this anime. I really recommend the One Piece manga so much. It is by far one of my favorites, but this anime adaptation isn't good.

    One Piece is the legendary treasure said to be of unimaginable value. 
 
It was said to be hidden somewhere deep in the Grand Line, presumably on the last island, Raftel, by the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed, he announced to the world that this great treasure could be claimed by anyone who could reach it, thereby starting the Great Age of Pirates. 
No one except the surviving members of the Roger Pirates actually knows where and what the great treasure is. The most popular theory is that they hid it on Raftel, the final island of the Grand Line. 
 
Given the recurring theme that a treasure is merely something of great personal value (e.g. Luffy's hat) and that Roger, like Luffy, did not value money or gold, One Piece may be nothing more than an item Gol D. Roger valued. In Buggy's flashback to his days as a member of the Roger Pirates, he discussed with Shanks the meaning of a treasure, and he found that all the crew shared the same views regarding personal value.[1] 
 
The closest the Straw Hat Pirates have ever come to finding out the nature of One Piece was during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc when Usopp tried to ask Silvers Rayleigh about it. However, Luffy stopped him on the grounds that learning about it from someone else would defeat the purpose of their adventures and that becoming the Pirate King would have little merit if he already knew anything about One Piece.[2] 
 
After decades of speculations and doubts, the treasure's existence was confirmed by Whitebeard with his last breath. He mentioned that ""a grand battle will engulf the entire world"" and ""the world will be shaken to its core"" when One Piece is found.[3]

    Right off the bat One Piece was not a series I was interested in. I found the art really bizarre, the amount of episodes off-setting, the slow pace of the story to deal with, and quite honestly the voice actor for Luffy annoyed the the heck out of me! However, after devoting my time to watching 650+ episodes of this magnificent series, a love I've never had for any other anime series has developed. I have given this series 7/10 even though is it by far one of my favourite series because it is not without its flaws. 
 
Story: 8/10 
One Piece is by-far one of the most developed story lines I have ever witnessed conveyed through anime. The thing about it that places it above most other series is that we have a plain goal given to us at the beginning of the story that has maintained its focus throughout the entire series so far. It is a very straight-forward series, and the idea of the 'treasure' being at the end of the Grandline makes the whole series flow. What's more is that from this goal, more goals start to string off and in the end we have a story that has created a magical world of adventure. What I like to tell people when I suggest One Piece is to imagine the dream to become the Pirate King a straight line, and from this imagine every side-story (and there's A LOT!) pulling off from this line and developing its own line. It sounds completely confusing, but the story as a whole is fabricated to have a nice and easy-to-follow flow that still has plenty of room for surprise! Only the most thought-out story lines can maintain this flow.  
 
Needless to say, the anime is an adaption from the manga and as such it has its flaws. At times important hints given within the manga to help develop the story line go without animation. Which doesn't seem like a big issue, but overall it gravely lacks the mind blowing development to which the manga has. Furthermore, filler episodes tend to be the most bizarre arcs I have ever seen. There has been one or two filler arcs that has fitted completely well into the story and I would've thought they were canon; but in saying this the series also offers the most absurd filler ideas - and this accounts for about 80% of all filler arcs in the series. Some of the filler arcs are extremely painful to watch through. Overall, the general story line of One Piece is extremely thought out and planned, but due to anime adaption it has it flaws and therefore I give the story an 8/10. 
 
ART - 6/8 
Straight up, one of the reasons why I was hesitant at first to begin One Piece was due to the art style. This is very common among anyone who comes across the series, and while some people might push past it, others may not overcome it, and others will completely avoid the series. I'm very picky when it comes to the art style of a series, and if I don't like it I will lack enjoyment for it as a whole. In saying this, One Piece has been probably one of the only series that I have learnt to love. After avoiding the series for years, I only attempted it out of boredom and even then I wasn't completely thrilled about watching it due to the art style. It's very different from everything else I enjoy, and sort of seemed off-putting. I'm telling you now - at least attempt to watch the series for a good run and see how you adapt to it. Most One Piece fans will tell you they disliked the art style at first also; however it's truly something you grow to love. After 600+ episodes, I couldn't imagine such a series full of adventure with another art style. The art style is what makes One Piece. 
 
To make it clear, I am not giving art a 7/10 for the general art style of the series, but rather because of how the series has been animated. Anyone who knows Toei (the animation studio) comes to understand that they tend to cut corners - even for a big time anime like One Piece. The art can be super sloppy, and poorly done to the point that it becomes laughable. Scenes that should have spectacular artwork are not given the detail to really bring out what the scene should encompass. Despite Toei's faults, all in all the series has a unique art style that sets it afar from the rest. Either you'll love it or you hate it - and however that may evolve depends upon the watcher. All I can say in this regard is the art style might surprise you. It did for me. 
 
SOUND - 10/10 
The sounds and music in One Piece is one of my favourite things about the series. When asked whether someone should watch the anime or read the manga, I tell them they should do both despite the faults of the anime. The reason why is because I feel like the music, voice characters, and so on are so well done in this show that it really adds to the series as a whole for me. I could listen to all the openings in one day. Many of the songs in One Piece brings back memories for me, and a sense of nostalgia. All the songs are enjoyable, and will have you singing out the words in no time. They fit the atmosphere of the series - that being one of adventure and nakamaship. 
 
The choice voice actors (namely in regards to the Japanese sub) is extremely well done. Personally for me all the characters fit their voices! One thing One Piece fans love to laugh at is the unique laughs created for each characters - which I will promise you you will probably try it in private yourself! Like I stated before, at the beginning of the series Luffy's voice annoyed me. As I got more into the series, I became attached to it and couldn't enjoy Luffy's voice as anyone else. The voice actors are able to bring out the character's personality through their skills - which is why I tell people that it's worth it to watch the anime. 
 
CHARACTER - 9/10 
For an expanding world of wonder comes with the challenge of characters. To have such a large set out, to have too few characters introduced would make the series feel empty and not lively enough. To have too many you risk characters who need development to be left under-developed. Unlike many other animes, the layout for One Piece is extremely large - that being basically the WHOLE WORLD. Even so, each character is given the attention and detail it needs. Minor characters are given minor development, and major characters (tend) to be given major development.  
 
Overall you can break the characters up in the series into several categories of importance: major, semi-major, minor and background characters. Those who are major being the crew, those being semi-major meaning the reoccurring characters who had the spotlight in a particular arc, minor being characters who were given detail in the slightest, and background characters being just that. It's a large field to cover, so the development has to be precise for it to be effective. Even so, characters are usually given the necessarily development to make you appreciate them. In particular the crew - all with their interesting and differing back stories - have each their own struggles and goals they wish to achieve. For each character it's a long run of endurance and change - and watching the process of each of these lovable characters becoming the people they want to be - whether slowly or quickly - is truly a journey. Despite this, it is wrong to say all characters in the crew are given the rightful amount of development they deserve. Some of the crew mates tend to be given the spotlight more so than others, and as such they are portrayed as lacking in that area. Needless to say, to say these crews aren't developed at all is also wrong. 
 
One thing I find admirable about the series is how so many differing and sometimes conflicting personalities are portrayed throughout the series - and how they develop not just individuality but between each other. Nakamaship is greatly emphasized within the series, and you'll be able to see how characters (mainly in the crew) interact with each other and form relationships. As the series progressed I found myself loving particular friendships between particular characters - think Zoro and Sanji, or the coward trio! It is extremely hard for any writer/author/etc to effectively develop characters in these areas, and when it happens recognition deserves to be given. 
 
Another cool thing I find interesting about the characters is how they are developed from real-life people. Most characters in One Piece of some importance you will find their roots into bigger inspiration in real life i.e. for example Mihawk from Dracula, or Blackbeard obviously from the legendary pirate Blackbeard. Of course these should be recognized to the manga's author, Oda; however, needless to say I believe the anime has done a great job in adapting them and portraying them how they should be. Thus I have given this area a 9/10. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 8/10 
My enjoyment for the series tends to be lacking due to one issue: pacing. All the other cons are vastly overcome by the pros; however sometimes the pacing becomes unbearable. Having watched the anime first all the way to episodes 500-600 before I picked up the manga, the pacing never really got to me. It was there, without a doubt, and my first experience with the anime can tell you it took me a year to have the willpower to get past the first 20 episodes. This pacing is only emphasized once you start comparing it with the manga, and it gets to the point where you you may not be able to watch episodes without thinking about how it was paced within the manga - which greatly affected my enjoyment for the series. No doubt One Piece would be a large anime regardless of pacing, but needless to say the ratio of episode to chapter has certainly pushed the limits of episodes. 
 
While pacing remains an issue for me, I still believe the pros I have had for the series as a whole have provided me with one of the best anime experiences I have ever had. This series is definitely not without flaws. Some areas lack, but in saying this other areas shine. It's entirely up the individual experience on whether the cons over weigh the pros, or vise via; but personally the pros have given me an entirely fantastic experience that the cons simply can't take away. My enjoyment for this series is undeniable. 
 
OVERALL - 7/10 
While this rating may not seem good and may reflect that One Piece is not a masterpiece as a whole, please remember I am simply a fan who has taken into account the problems One Piece has. One Piece - regardless of the cons I have reasoned out here - is one of the most memorable series. It is not for everyone, but I emphasize that it is not a series that you should dismiss without trial. The adaption isn't always on point, and things can be done better, but I adore this series and I hate seeing people passing it by due to silly reasons.

    I don't think everyone can like One Piece. But I'm sure of one thing, that people who like it will think this one is the best ever!  
For me, I pray it never ends, never ever because I think it's a life style. I feel they're alive, real ppl :) Because all the characters are so real -although it's impossible to have a stretching friend- and this show isn't in a hurry to tell its story to us, lets us have all the fun freely. 
It shakes me everytime I watch a new episode. I would be the happiest person ever if I really had a friend like Luffy.  
I love every little thing about it. I don't want to talk about technical details or music or manga drawings etc. I am just telling you this is a masterpiece! I want to believe the impossible becomes real with these guys :) 
God bless Eiichiro Oda :) and I will be watching it in every week of my life thanks to him :)

    One Piece is one hell of a piece of anime! It has adventure, Action, Comedy, Emotions, .. almost everything. It is a kind of anime after which after watching you will love pirates and aim for a life with piracy (umm a good piracy) well there are always good and bad in the world. 
The only problem i find with this anime is that it is a little slow. But the story and character portray are just awesome! The way characters are shown in this series is apt as it makes it more towards the unrealistic pirate world, Superstitions of the seas and their stories. 
It is an ultimate series with almost everything. There are very few fillers in this series; 1-2 episodes per 100 maybe. So the story progresses a little slowly. But trust me , you are gonna enjoy it a lot !! You might start your own kaizoku-club after watching this superb series.

    Is it useful to describe One piece? Its just one of the master piece of this kind of manga. 
At the beginning the art can be difficult to come in. But when your are in the story you can not stop to watch the anime. 
The story start slowly but everything become definitely more exciting when they come to the great road. It began to love this manga at this moment. 
 
If you want to start this anime be patient. At the moment when I write there are around 500 episodes!!!

    One piece is a great shounen series. Some people might wonder why I put the score so low. We are talking about the anime here thats why. At first the animation was fine but later on after the new world it became terrible. Pacing is too slow and the animators are lazy. I would have given early one piece anime a 6 or a 7 but overall its not that good. I still recommend the anime because at times some scenes are done better than in the manga and the story of one piece is still interesting. just don't expect something top quality

    Here is my review of One Piece. One Piece are maybe the best shounen series available at the moment since  it has almost everything, so it’s a must watch anime.  
 
Story 
One Piece is about a pirate named Monkey D Luffy he is going to the Pirate king and find One Piece the greatest treasure of them all. On his way Luffy are going to gather some pirates some of them are: Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji, But the way to the Grand line is though they must fight against the marine, some mermaids,  Shichibukai also known as the seven warlords.  
 
Art 
Since the anime started in 98 the animation was kind of bad, but I got used to it, and the animation get’s a lot better over the years. It’s now released in 720p.  
 
Sound 
I like the voice cast all the main characters has some cool and kawaii voices, if you don’t liked them you will get used to it and like them prolly.  Please don’t watch the dubbed version since it sucks.  
 
I simply love the BGM in this anime it’s good. The openings are okey, nothing special the same with the endings.  
 
Character 
All the characters in One Piece are loveable since they have a unique personality that you will like and cherish.  You will get to know every character well since it will tell you about their past while you watch the series.  
 
Enjoyment 
In the start there is a lot of information about the Grand Line and the treasure One Piece. In episode 30 or something like that the anime is amazing and after that you can’t stop watch it since it so good I liked it very much.  
Overall 
One Piece is maybe the most popular anime in the whole world expect of Pokèmon though, so One Piece is fairly good anime. I guess many users here on MAL started to watch One Piece so I will say One Piece is a good starting anime for all new people  who have not seen much anime.   
If you liked my review or not PM me!

    Ok everything about this anime it's outstanding, in my opinion One Piece is the Best shounen anime Ever. 
Now let us start: 
 
STORY: It's story is Adorable a masterpiece that was named One Piece, the real deal and the good part is not only about that pirate king that hid one treasure, but it is those countless men that went out to search for it! Thrilling and exiting a story that had many anime-watchers riveted.  
 
ART: The art is Awesome the animation was fixed a little after some 200 eps(or so) every detail every part that is important for the viewer to understand the situation is being drew excelently 
 
CHARACTER: I think that the characters are one of the most outstanding things in One Piece. For starters the main character the one that wants to become king of the pirate is UNIQUE, moreover other characters are so weird and peculiar and by using them the anime is far more intersting and fun. 
 
ENJOYMENT: Not much about the enjoyment i just have to say that when an episode finishes i was like: ""i want more One Piece!!"" 
 
Now to conclude every thing about this anime is so well organized, the anime is perfect in sooo many genres it has Great action- Hillarious situations- Sad situations- Many teachings- Tremendous adventures 
 
Watch it... You MUST watch it.

    Well after watching 500+ episodes and reading the manga I think this is a good stopping point for me to review the masterpiece of an anime-series which is One Piece. 
 
At this point it’s kind of cliché to even review this anime due to the massive number of reviews written so far but in reality I feel that one piece STILL does not get the standing ovation it deserves. 
 
And maybe the ridiculous and continued FAILED Americanisation attempts of it is to blame……well anywayz it still beats ALL anime-series to date. 
 
Animation  
 
In its early days it was drawn in a lets say a “misleading” comical sense that can present the series as slapstick, well the animation complements the idea of a simple comedy - which is so far from the whole picture. 
 
Intense battle scenes can make you think your watching the most serious and brutal of anime, combined with very distinctive facial expressions of laughter, anger, disgust, misery and every other colour of the rainbow - its actually refreshing to see this basic style of animation depict such a range of emotions.  
 
Over the years you can see more detail has been put into the simple animation design without any artistic compromise…a fantastic and unique feat in my humble opinion. 
 
*A Special shout out goes to all the Fan-subbing groups for adding fantastic graphical text for character special moves (Kaizoku fansubs, Vegapunk etc)* 
 
Sound  
 
Well..well 
Firstly…let’s start by just saying the original Japanese audio is flawless in every way Openings, Closings, Background & all voice actors PERFECT. 
 
Secondly & Sadly 
4Kids entertainment have forever stained and ruined the one piece experience for countless westerners who sadly watched the horrific English dub and got a totally unreal one piece experience and although Funimation entertainment has taken over and re-dubbed it, its not only too late but still not up to scratch again. This just proves the fact that some anime just cannot be applied correctly to other regions without losing the spirit of the anime! 
 
Sorry for the mini-rant but the true one piece fans are just fed up! 
 
Japanese audio is perfect and English dub should be avoided like the swine flu! 
 
Story  
 
Again at first glance One Piece can appear to look like a slapstick pirate comedy but it’s so much more. Every character has a story in one piece and there are probably 100+ stories that could be told but the anime focuses on the ever growing Straw Hat Crew and each character of the crew. These stories usually involve a traumatizing childhood, a pivotal character related death and a goal for that character to achieve (told beautifully I might add). 
 
These stories are just brilliant and I must say out of all the long running anime series I’ve seen Dragonball, Pokemon, stupid Naruto and Bleach etc - One Piece just feels like there’s hardly any filler as all the episodes just seem to contribute to the straw hat pirates adventure!  
 
With exception to the historical special arcs found more recently which are mildly comical but not like 130 eps (STUPID-ASS NARUTO!!!) ahem. 
 
 
Characters  
 
As I said before One Piece has a HUGE number of characters From Crewmates, Marines, Civilians and SUPERVILLANS. Yep One thing One Piece does well is VILLANS these villans are the definition of pirates where killing attacking manipulating and even beating women & children is all fair play. 
 
The characters in one piece just tend to bring out the emotions in its audience Luffy will have you laughing and rooting for victory, Nami will have you wondering do all women love money this much and Zoro will have you saying should’nt this sword guy be in samurai champloo? Lol. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
One piece is easily the anime I have had the most pleasure enjoying in my anime career and I tend to use it as a pick me up emotionally, as most fans will tell you one piece has a very therapeutic quality to it..yep that’s a weird thing to say but if you agree with me chances are you hit the helpful button below this review. 
 
If I had anything bad to say about One Piece it is around the 300 Ep point I started to feel that the storyline would go in a repetitive routine that was starting to become a little bit too predictable – and just after I started feeling that way around the 400’s the entire series changes gears and shakes things up big time……so much for predictability! 
 
Value  
 
In my opinion one piece has something for everyone Action, Adventure, Comedy and trust me even though people don’t mention it this anime can actually bring ya to tears of sadness and most definitely tears of joy. 
 
Sadly I’ve noticed the sheer number of episodes steer many newcomers away thinking its too much of a commitment. 
 
This is one of the few anime I say makes me proud to be an anime fan its just One in a Million which NEVER fails to entertain! i would just warn people to not be fooled by its slapstick appearance and STAY AWAY FROM ANY AND ALL ENGLISH DUBBED VERSIONS OF ONE PIECE IT’S THE EQUVIALENT TO WATCHING POKEMON…actually that’s insulting Pokemon…sorry Ash!

    Now before fanboys get mad at me I'm just goint to say I love One Piece very much, it's one of my favorite manga of all time. It's thorough, colorful and exciting. But I have a LOT of problems with the anime.  
 
Story: The story is good, it's serviceable. Luffy goes out on an adventure to become king of the pirates. A very generic concept but once he assembles his crew (Zoro, Sanji, Chopper, Nami and Usopp specifically) things get a lot more exciting. The villains (ESPECIALLY CROCODILE) stand out a lot because of how different they are from each other. There's a lot of good guys in the marines and there's a lot of good pirates on the sea so it creates this gray area which is extremely interesting. Now for my problem with the anime, the pacing is absolute DOGSHIT and I really don't think there's an excuse for it at this point. Look at Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, it is another really long manga but it's gotten through 3 LONG story arcs without going over 100 episodes. One Piece takes its sweet time going through things and it really hurts the experience. I'm only on episode 45 of the anime because I can't handle sitting down and watching the 700 something episodes while I'm caught up with the manga 
 
Art: The style faithfully adapts Oda's work its based off of. Although at times it looks pretty awful and uncanny valley (ESPECIALLY NAMI'S FACE JESUS CHRIST SHE LOOKS SCARY AT TIMES.) I understand looking ugly some frames, it comes with animation but lord it's really bad sometimes. Like I said, the anime's style faithfully represents Oda's original work BUT it's still pretty ugly at times and I'm not talking about the random frames, I'm talking about just looking at the anime. Oda's artwork didn't translate super well into anime form.  
 
Sound: The voice actors in both the japanese version but everybody knows how shit the 4kids dub is at this point. I don't even have to talk about it. Just listen to the pirate rap and you'll understand. The voice actors in that version are so shit they take away the emotional power of some very sad scenes its that bad.  
 
Character: This is the part where the anime succeeds with flying colors (mainly because it's pretty difficult to fuck up characters from the source material but you get me.) The strawhat gang especially are well done compared to the big 3's main character and their ""crews."" The strawhats all have aspirations outside of Luffy's big dream, they all feel individual instead of desperately clinging to the mc's goal. My personal favorite strawhat is Zoro, he's been there since day 1 and he's extremely loyal. Unlike other anime characters, he doesn't forget his dream when he goes with Luffy and he continues to train. The villains are also pretty amazing, Crocodile is a cruel and sadistic pirate who watched four people who wanted to fight him die slowly while he laughed, Akainu is a bastard (One piece fans will understand why he is, spoilers) and Blackbeard is cowardly scum you DESPERATELY want to watch lose  
 
Enjoyment: IT'S ONE PIECE! If you're a fan of the manga you're gonna enjoy the anime, it's a faithful adaptation that doesn't leave anything out as far as I've seen. It's great seeing some of my favorite pirates in motion even though the animation leaves a little bit to be desired. I really highly recommend this if you're too lazy to read the manga and you still want to experience One Piece. It's shonen action at it's finest. I hope you enjoy the story as much as I am.

    The best way to describe One Piece is that it is a snowball rolling down a hill, gradually building up becoming bigger and bigger. This is probably the best way to explain the story and its development within One Piece, a lot of people struggle to get through the early episodes and I can see why but due to its snowball effect even 30 episodes later a vast majority of people are hooked. 
 
Story: 10 
 
One Pieces story follows the idea of each character having a goal they all wish to complete, but the story does not focus on this idea instead it is the adventure of achieving this goal that it follows. These adventures can be short or long, often short at the start and gradually building up as more and more depth is added to the show and around characters.  
 
When the story kicks off, shit really does hit the fan and the author of One Piece is always surprising me. There have been times I have cried, times I have laughed and times were I have wanted to knock the shit out of one of the bad guys (And it is extremely satisfying when they get the shit beaten out of them, trust me!) 
 
Art: 10(?) 
 
In regards to art style I think its very very difficult to rate an anime for its art, it may sound cliché but... Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  
 
One Piece is 10 years old and the art takes a directional change at about episode 200+ but this is in more regards to quality and colour rather then style, I myself absolutely adore One Piece and its art because of the sheer amount of colour and I never feel as though there is a couple of frames missing at any point during high action scenes. (I often find modern shows like Madoka Magicka to be lacking in colour, but that is entirely my personal preference and I can see why people like that art) 
 
Sound: 10 
 
Its impossible not to fall in love with the soundtrack of One Piece, whoever comes up with the soundtrack and what moment with what song is an absolute genius. The tracks always fit the mood, and when the infamous track 'Overtaken' comes on you know shit is about to go down. 
 
As for the sound effects themselves I can't say I have ever noticed really, I am always immersed into the show and I could not imagine they'd be any different. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The idea of the large crew of main characters put me off a little when I first heard about One Piece, character development is an important aspect for me to really get a feel for the character and be on their side - This is solved by how the show is set out the way it is, full story arks which can last a lot of episodes to introduce a character and then bringing in their back story. The characters themselves are all extremely unique, each with their own 'flavor' of personality and with their own goal but all treat each-other as equals and friends, essentially there is no side character on the crew each is of utmost importance with their own personal in-depth story. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
I'll warn any college students who have exams around the corner, One Piece is the type of show that you'll say to yourself one more episode.. then that episode ends and you are hit by a big 'To Be Continued' sign and you tell yourself, ok, just one more episode.  
 
I have laughed, cried and been pumped up with excitement watching One Piece - It is truly one of those shows which I never want to end but at the same time want to see how it ends. The day One Piece ends will be a very sad day indeed! 
 
Overall/TLDR: 10 
 
One Piece is absolutely fantastic in very aspect for me, I try to recommend it to anyone/anything I can even if they do not watch anime because it is truly a masterpiece and the only thing I have ever felt inclined to re-watch so many times. 
 
A friend who often watches anime couldn't believe it was over 500 episodes long, as he often watches anime that are one or two seasons in length (13 to 24 episodes) and asked me how I have the patience to watch them all. It was really surprising to me that he thought like this because to me 500 episodes is not enough, because each episode will have you hanging on the edge asking yourself whats next on the adventure.

    I despised One Piece years ago, I would flick through channels to see what was on, and see an absolutely unappealing show, that upon the sight & sound I cringe in hate. This would carry with me in my mindset when I started to get into anime, and see as one of the most popular shows being that trash called One Piece (of shit). I didn't think twice about ever watching it, until a little word from a friend saying to watch it & it was apparently good, but I lashed back saying it was terrible. A guy who can stretch, REALLY??? Please.  
 
It was until that I had heard that there was a another English dub, and it peaked my interest, as well as seeing screenshots comparing the 4kids version to this new Funimation version, and I saw a bloody, more mature version to the childish crap I saw when I was younger. I was intrigued & intent to view this new take on the show, and after my brother receiving about 8 DVDs of the Funimation version of One Piece, we started on what would I now call my favourite anime so far. 
 
The story revolves around the golden age of pirates, which begins after the execution of the legendary pirate named Gold D. Roger (aka Gold Roger), who after conquering the Grand Line - and the only person to do so, is named the King of the Pirates. Moments before his execution, he exclaims that the legendary treasure he attained from his adventure - The One Piece, is out in the Grand Line for anyone to claim, and to venture out and search for it themselves. This sparks the dawn of the golden age of pirates, with thousands of men setting sail to attain the legendary treasure. 
 
22 years later a young man named Monkey D. Luffy mysteriously appears with the goal of becoming the King of the Pirates. Having eaten a devil fruit - a mysterious fruit that causes anyone who eats it to gain a strange & powerful ability, while sacrificing their ability to swim. Luffy is a rubber man, and makes a name for himself in every town he ventures through. Living through this dream he travels town after town, gathering crew members and spurring notoriety.  
 
This is truly the definition of an adventure, the scale of the world & the journey they go through, the heartships, the pain, the strength they attain, the character growth, the size of the journey in general, its huge, and with it planning to go on for another 10 years, Im happy to know that there is gunna be plenty of One Piece to go :) Some people see the length of the series being so far 600+ episodes long, and be absolutely daunted and hesitant to watch it. The thing they dont see is that if they watch it, and if they love it, that there is so much there for them to watch & enjoy.  
 
This is really a case of the saying that looks can be deceiving. A wacky art style, a boy pirate made of rubber, 600+ episodes long and not ending for another 10 years! But for those who have seen as much as I have (600+ episodes) you can understand why I am so hyped about this anime, and for those who haven't, I hope this can get you to have a little idea and perhaps see it for yourselves and join Luffy & the straw hat pirates on this amazing adventure :) 
 
Speaking of the straw hat, it was given to Luffy by a pirate called Shanks, and the thing with Shanks is, along with many of the other characters in this series is that they are so incredibly badass & awesome XD You meet these characters at the very start, and just wait in anticipation to seeing them again after the crazy stuff Luffy & his crew endure, only to see them even more incredibly badass than before, and its such an incredible feeling & experience. 
 
The character growth in this is magnificent too, the straw hat even has a deep backstory!! :P Every time you meet another crew member, you see their past, which most of the time is an absolute tear jerker, and gets you attached to that character, and before you know it, your attached to everyone in the crew, and they grow on you. They go through unbelievably absurd obstacles & struggles, face the most powerful foes there is, face death, and manage to prevail if it means defeating the foe, or losing and building up their strength. You are essentially a part of Luffy's crew, and when they go through heartache, you break down along with them, when they prevail, its the best feeling ever.  
 
When One Piece eventually hooks you in, and eventually convinces you to becomes one of the crew members, your in for one hell of a journey. And It isn't going to end anytime soon, so you'll have plenty of crazy places to run into, awesome characters to face, and the absolutely ridiculous Luffy causes chaos wherever he may be :P And eventually wait for the day where he will, in fact, become the King of the Pirates. And what a wonderful day that will be :D

    Hello All.  Firstly let me say. This review is about the facts of the show.   I will try to leave my personal opinon out of it until the end, because for one it's my favorite anime.   What I hope this review does is give you some insight about the anime and what to expect. 
 
==Story == 
 
Yes im sure youv'e heard of it.  Monkey D. Luffy, an ordinary boy who ate a fruit of the ocean (devils fruit) turned into a rubber man.  After being saved by his role model who is a pirate, he goes off to be the King of the Pirates.   
 
==Anime Episodes== 
 
Firstly, there are three versions of this anime.  The first being the Original Japanese version which I highly recommend.    The second being the Funimation english dub version, which is the exact translation of the Japanese version.    And lastly.. the dreaded 4kids version which should not be watched and burned on sight.   (Sorry for that opinon but I think all one piece fans will agree) 
 
==500+ Episodes OMG== 
 
Yes the anime is over 500 episodes long.  But don't let the number scare you away.   One piece tells a story with every single arc.  Oda (the Creator) made the show in a way where you get the see what is going through the minds of every main character and enemy before the fight/struggle/adventure takes place.   I warn you now.  If you are looking for just pure action, READ THE MANGA.   The anime stays true to the fights but, its an anime.  They can't just catch up on the  manga.  So what do they do? They extend the fights, and the events before the fights.   I think its great, but for some, it may seem as though the anime is dragging on. 
 
==Artwork== 
 
Nowadays anime's are coming out in 1080p.  One piece is older, so naturally the orignal episodes look older.  But rest assured, by the time you get to Enes lobby arc, there will be a huge animation quality upgrade.  Not opinion, fact.  
 
==Character Development == 
 
Each character develops because they all have thier own personal goals and dreams as they travel with Luffy (or try to capture him).   They all mature in thier own way.   And when I say everybody I mean EVERYBODY.   Again.. 500+ episodes.    
 
== Opinion == 
 
Watch it.  Don't expect it to kick off into a action packed pew pew shoot em up fight until many episodes in.   But what got me hooked was seeing his crew get through struggles, fight for their goals and life, seeing them face enemies that are sometimes stronger than thier entire crew put together, or more cunning than them.   Seeing how a person who's only abilitly is stretching with some inhuman strength fight enemies made of elements such as smoke for example.   Seeing the tears of thier crewmembers as they fight for thier friends.   Truly, I found this anime to be moving, funny, and have some insanely INTENSE fights.    This is also the first anime where I was rooting for some of the bad guys as well as good guys.  I love luffy's crew, but some baddies are just... damn cool (Icy Cool in fact.) 
 
==Closing== 
If your looking for an anime thats short, to the point, great kickoff, than this is not the anime for you.  It's long, but enjoyably so. 
If DO however have time, patience, and in the mood for a good story with in my opinion GREAT rewards for sticking with it, than this is the anime for you.    
 
 I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

    I have been watching this anime and reading manga for over a year. It has only gotten better. Although I enjoy the anime, I recommend folks to read the manga, which is the original work of the writer, and please dont watch the dubbed English version of this animation, they have done a crappy job and the emotions, the feel, its all wrong in dubbed version. 
 
Best story, with careful and in depth development of all characters, funny as hell, good action and great quality of art, one of my favorite animes of all times, and anime writer is going for 1k episodes, so be patient, and stay addicted like I am :)

    I think that you wanted for a long time to watch One Piece, but you put it off because of its number of episodes, then you should go and read the manga. You will catch up a lot faster and you will experience the One Piece story at its fullest. But if you are not a manga fan and you only watch anime, I recommend you to watch the special Episode of East Blue, which is a summary for the first saga, with great art and animation. If you enjoy it, then go and start the actual anime from episode 1 so you do not miss anything of this story, that makes One Piece such a beautiful series. 
 
I will be short: the enjoyment and the overall score are both 10/10. The story, the art, the sound, the characters, everything is a 10 out of 10 for me. But the anime has pacing issues. The pacing is so slow sometimes that is infuriating. That is why I think is better to binge One Piece when you watch it. Or read the manga.  
The voice acting is on point. The art and the animation can be weird sometimes, but overall I enjoyed the visuals. 
I was introduced to this series via the anime, I caught up with 750 episodes, which was the number of episodes that were out 3 years ago, in just 3 months. Then, I went and read the manga from chapter 1. I have watched all the movies and special episodes. 
 
I will not go into detail about the story and the characters in this review. If you want, you can check my manga review. 
Overall, this is a good adaptation, but not quite on the level of the greatness that is the manga.

    So, it's a shounen, a goofy and silly shounen indeed, but I think what it fills even better is being a prime example of what not to be.  
 
So the art. It's probably worse than any American cartoon I've ever seen. I mean, my little brother could draw better than that. Honestly it's more hysterical than anything because of how appallingly bad it is. 
 
Episode 1 started off with your eyes and ears bleeding, from both the terrible art to the terrible sound (and yes, I mean the screaming). That kid was screaming so loud I though his voice would break. But unfortunately, this did not happen. 
 
I have given this anime a total of 3 chances so far. Every time it has undoubtably let me down. It has now become a running joke amongst my friends, I guess it has that going for it.

    This is a anime that will suprise you all the way....not just a few times like some other animes but siriously all the way ^^ why? i could say its awesome but i doubt you (reader) will be thinking ""wow then it must be as good as he says"" rofl so here we go.... 
 
i will number this maybe its easyer.....the top 10 best things about this anime with 10 as not so great and 1 great 
 
10. The art style, yes a big issue for allot of people who considerd this anime and didnt watch it because of the art style....but if you remember it well this is a review about the 10 GOOD things so that means the art style isnt a bad thing. actually its refreshing and suprisingly good. It shouldnt be anything difrent , if it would have it would be one piece as we know it....maybe its difficult to get into it because it isnt high end drawings but still it makes it unique and thats why its still good when its bad.  
 
9. Pirates....it isnt my fav subject around on this world actually beside pirates of the carab i never liked things about pirates....whats with the old ships, the crappy heads and the drinking all the time anyway? but this made the pirate genre so difrent so new that after watching this serie you will love them....maybe because its not really traditional pirates....its more like a comination between fantasy and the good old pirate work....and still you will see allot of big characters in the pirate world that you will remember of from stories like disney. 
 
8. the world....yes this is something that comes right after the subject pirates....because its unique in its own way and still something that shouldnt have been used to begin with...a whole world made out of water and island.....you would think it would be boring because even after a few of episodes from pokemon when they where traveling around islands it got boring....but this wont.....you will notice sometimes they stick around on an island for tons of eps and still you wont be bored....the world has allot of favriations but but still not that much that you will get lost....great design of the world ^^  
 
7. villain....yes, they are awesome, they are scary....but not too scary, they are funny but not that much that you wont take them sirious anymore and even if you take them sirious and you are scared of them they still will make you laugh at some point.....sometimes they are all fun sometimes they are all sirous but most of the time they are an combination of both and they have awesome attacks, unique abilities and last but not least some weird way of always returning and never actually die.....its up too you if thats a good or bad thing. 
 
6. npc's....yes i shouldnt call them no playable caracters but you feel for the crew of the luffys ship but you never actually feel compasion about the people surounding them....only a few times but that s because they are longer in the storie then a few eps....anyway, the people who help the strawhead crew are great they give that little bit of extra to make the story going on even when it gots boring..... 
 
5. the ship.....i wont go on about this for too much but at some point you will even care about the ship where our heroes sail on.... 
 
4. the music....yes its a big deal, maybe not from the start but the anime has about over 400 episodes now and still allot of the sounds are still being used from episode 1.....this makes it special because after about 100 eps you will remember them you will sing them in your head and you will c rave for the ost to have....even the opening and ending songs are great, various, and original.... 
 
3. humor....yes, comedy is a big deal in this anime....even at times you dont expect it its there and you want it to be there....be affraid, because your tummy will hurt when you watch a few eps in a row ^^  
 
2. the crew....the strawhead crew is one of those things that makes this show go how it goes.....they have allot of histroy and backgrounds, they are unique and original designd and they have their own flaws but also their own powers....they are difrent then all the other caracters in this anime and thats why its a good choice they are almost in every episode ^^  
 
1. the story.....yes this is I think the best thing about this anime.....the story, not only will you not expect an anime drawn this simple have a very deep story at some points, also you wont expect to actually tear and cry because of it....you want to watch all those 400+ eps because you WANT to know how it goes further.....you will be on a story rush 24/7....even the fillers are great, funny and deep enough to watch them....and to be honest i think if a story is great about an anime its already worth watching even all the other things dont work for you.... 
 
 
Thats why i recomend dont hold back because of the art style or the weird sence of humor sometimes and keep watching .....after 30/50 eps you will be hooked and smack yourself on the head blaiming yourself you didnt watch it to begin with ^^

    One Piece for me is probably the greatest piece of work I've ever seen come from an anime creator.  The incredible thing has nothing to do with the art or the special effects, but rather the powerful emotion drawn from within many of the scenes incited by the characters.  The emotional scenes draw out the full potential and strength of the main characters which makes them look really (how should i say it ""nutz"" or ""kickass"").  If that isn't enough, its flawless storyline brings out something more and more and as the story goes on and on and every little event comes into detail which all connects together for the preparation of an incredible event yet to come.  One Piece never fails to make me laugh, cry, and do both at the same time in this amazing piece of work.

    One Piece is The Greatest Shonen Anime/Manga of all time. 
 
It features a grand adventure full of colourful and developed characters, each with their own unique goals and dreams. The narrative is extremely well-paced and intriguing with great writing and presentation; the Animation and Music are both incredibly top-notch. They give each Arc/Location it's own style of atmosphere which makes the series very innovative. This coincides with the genius storytelling that balances badass action scenes and hilarious comedic moments. One Piece is also a very memorable show with gorgeous imagery and designs. An example of this brilliance is in the backstory for the Punk Hazard Arc where a character with a Fire-type ability battles an Ice-type character for a long time in one location, an island. This results in a contrast of settings and characters because half the island is covered in Ice while the other half is engulfed by Fire, so different variations and ideas are explored in just one Arc! 
 
Finally, the series just knows how to have fun and not be overly-dramatic like many other Animes. This in turn, makes the few brilliant dramatic episodes all the more impactful!  
 
One Piece is a True Classic.

    I'm writing this review because the people who think they know what this anime is about after watching 30 episodes annoy me. Some even criticise one piece because it's tOo LoNg. Let me say, first of all, that you can't become the king of the pirates in 60 episodes. 
 
If you're looking for the typical main character, selfless, strong, who does everything right, then DON'T watch one piece. Luffy makes a lot of wrong moves. A LOT. That's what this anime is really about. A dummy and careless captain who needs his friends (and a bunch of other very interesting people) to fulfil his dream. Yes, he's saved a lot of people during his adventure, but he's put even more people in danger when he was in trouble. He loses fights. He annoys his friends. He wants everything to go his way. He is very familiar with the words ""mistake"" and ""defeat"". That's what makes him special. You'll see his and his nakamas' (buddies) character developments in one piece.  
 
Is it slow? Only if you want it to be. If you can't appreciate every detail, such as characters' (usually) sad pasts, you'll find yourself bored sometimes. The sense of time is pretty realistic in the one piece world. The crew needs to train? Forget the one-episode-long evolution, and get ready to see real changes (that obviously take some time).  
 
I've enjoyed every single episode, loved each and every character, and valued all the little details in the series. Every fan understands why one piece is so long, that's why many get mad when someone says it shouldn't have so many episodes. I believe that one piece is worth 800 episodes, and many many more <3

    One Piece is a great example of that saying ""Too much of everything is bad"". 
 
Story: 6/10 
Had I only watched half of the series, then I would've given it a 10/10 score. Because One Piece is actually good, really good! - at least up until Marineford Arc - after that, the story became overly dramatic. It's as  if the author himself wasn't able to move on from the reactions that Marineford arc has received - thus he started using it a lot of times to give Luffy and Ace' fans some emotional scenes - it was effective at first, but he did it too much to the point that it has lost it's effect. 
 
Overly huge size boobs - Most female characters suddenly have those overly huge boobs (especially Nami and Robin) it was used too much for fan service so the attention for the characters were often divided between their bouncing boobs and what they were doing. 
 
Another thing that I didn't like is the way that SH crew members were separated. What I really love in One Piece, is the relationship between SH crew members - that strong friendship that they built during their journey - that family like  bond that they have. They cry and laugh together, face different problems together and solve them all together - I really miss that part of this series. 
 
 
Art: 6/10 
One Piece had that unique animation and art style but after that time skip, it changed drastically. The characters are no longer as good looking as before. 
 
Sound: 5/10 
The opening and ending songs weren't really my type so I often skipped them after listening to it once. Although the sound effects and musical scores that they use during emotional and intense fights scenes are really good. 
 
Character: 9/10 
The main characters are still the same. They grew up and changed a lot, compared to how they were when they were introduced the first time - although they are still as hilarious as ever. 
There are some new characters that were introduced...they were interesting at first but they didn't left a strong impression on me...they are not the type that I will miss once they are gone. 
 
Overall: 6/10

    I don't know how to start writing this review because I don't know how to type what emotions I go through while watching this anime (and often days after). But the biggest feeling I get is awe. Awe with jaw drops and goosebumps. One top of that there's hilarious comedy, some tearful moments and conveyed anger. That is a part of what makes up my favourite anime of all time, One Piece. 
 
Even though I would think most know the basics of One Piece, I'll go through it again. 
There once lived a man named Gol D. Roger who was given the title The Pirate King. At his moment of execution, he announced that his greatest treasure, One Piece, is hidden away in 'that place' and invited anyone to find it. This brought The Great Age of the Pirates and many men set out to the sea to find One Piece and become Pirate King. 
The story follows Luffy, probably the most lovable hero you'll ever come across. He aims to become Pirate King and sets out on a journey through the seas to wholeheartedly follow his goal. He first plans to gather his crew members and a ship to then journey through the greatest and toughest seas, The Grand Line. 
 
Story 10/10 - The story One Piece follows is very unique, not just in comparison to other animes but also Hollywood. You might say, 'Pirates, big whoop, it's been done before' but I have no words to express how wrong you'd be. I wasn't a fan of the pirate genre (unless it had Johnny Depp in it) but One Piece opened my eyes.  
The plot is solid and I have to say that Oda knows how to tie everything together perfectly. There's nothing that doesn't happen for a reason in this anime. There aren't many useless fillers or completely pointless arcs. As the story moves further, you'll find yourself getting more and more attached.  
 
Sound 10/10 - The sound is brilliant. The music gets you leaning forward in your seat, eyes wide, grips hardened (hmm, sounds too much like a H-anime but you get what I mean). Without the music to braze together everything, I doubt One Piece would be worth half its value. The moods are set perfectly and I yet have to pick out a moment where a sound theme has even been a second too late or early. I get so hyped up when hearing certain music themes. Every character also has their own theme song which is just done perfectly to suit the character. Another thing that suits the characters is the laugh each character is given with their persona, each unique. 
 
Art 10/10 - I do admit I was one of those people who put off One Piece for a long time because I didn't like the art. I don't know if my vision was lacking because now that I can finally see, it is truly spectacular art. I thought the character design seemed half done but it couldn't suit each person more. The background art has always been beyond standards with certains scenes where you just want to pause and stare at.  
After the time skip, the art becomes more modern (by that I mean crisp). The characters have a new added gloss but they still have the style unique to One Piece.  
The main thing which I love about the animation is that there are regular costume changes for the characters. So you never sit through it and wonder if they actually are stinky pirates with scurvy. 
 
Characters 10/10 - Probably the strongest point of One Piece, as it should be for any anime (unfortunately this is too much to ask for in most cases). Luffy is an unwavering character who will always do what he thinks is right. He is childish and a bit spoilt but this makes him the person who everyone is drawn to. He doesn't chase any unnecessary romances, his mind is set to his one goal to become Pirate King. I have never heard (and doubt I ever will hear) anyone mention anything along the lines of 'I dislike Luffy'. The other main characters are also just as worthy. 
Zoro's determination makes him one of my favourite characters, also because he's just boss with his santoryu. 
Nami is a theif whose main interest is money and navigating but isn't that a true pirate? Her cunning ways make her the awesome character she is. 
Usopp is well Usopp. He's a liar and a coward just as his name states but he brings about the greatest character development because I have to say that I absolutely hated him at the start. 
Sanji is just kickass (it's a pun because he kicks to fight). His overly love towards women does become occasionally annoying but he is an amusing and strong character.  
Chopper, is a cotton candy loving reindeer often mistakened as a tanuki (racoon). He is a cute, lovable, funny character who can become something else when pushed. 
Robin is a smart character whose wit always has you thinking how cool she is.  
Franky is a suuppeerr character. He's strong and really funny. 
Brook is a very unique person. He's a hentai whose jokes always make you crack up laughing.  
 
All of these characters come with unique back stories and a purpose which I just love.  
The supporting characters of One Piece have been given so much of thought. Many characters grow to become your favourites. Characters such as Ace, Whitebeard, Mihawk, Shanks, Hancock, even though they don't play the main role, it feels as though a lot of thought has been poured into them. 
There have also been characters who were purposely created to hate, like the tenryuubito.  
 
All in all, the character section makes up the main traits of One Piece. 
 
Overall 10/10, I don't think I can give this any other score. It is an anime for all ages and I promise you that you will never regret watching it. One Piece isn't just something for entertainmemt, it's become a part of my life.

One piece gets so much praise, I wanted to know why so I decided to watch the anime, 90 episodes in, and I'm so disappointed. Music has little to no impact on the show. 
 
Art is pretty good from a show that started 16 years ago. 
 
When Luffy beats the main baddies, it just doesn't feel satisfying, his finishers and knockouts are so underwhelming. Luffy doesn't go through any real struggle or hardships to win, he just ""simply"" had the power all along to beat anyone. He's the most OP anime main character starting from episode 1 that I've ever seen. He'll take a few punches, but he'll save the day regardless and his crew members rely on him to do so.  
 
It's the same drill over and over, Luffy comes up with new moves with no backstory as to how he does so, he simply comes up with them on the fly like gomu gomu gatling, he's on par with a world class fighter.  
 
If I had to choose what show to recommend to other people, I'd choose Naruto instead. I'm listening to Man of the World from Naruto right now, and the journey, pain and sadness all the characters went through, makes me so appreciative of effective music.. 
 
I started with the anime of One Piece, so that I could remember Luffy's journey with it's music and get the full experience with VA's, sound effects, and OPs/EDs but it's been a unmemorable disaster. Naruto is simply better and more memorable in all aspects besides Art.  
 
One piece anime just doesn't compare.

    One piece, one of the best shounen Manga out there. If you want a good shounen story, with a deep lore and good character, you will need to read the One piece manga. But, why READ? because the anime is an utter failure! Yeah there's some good scene but that will never justify how bad the rest of animation is. There's an episode where the recapping is 10 minutes long, and then nothing happen! Some of the animation even just is a still image with bad background voice acting. Maybe this is justified with so many episode out there and how they try to matching-up with the manga, but then, it just better to stop the show air then get back later with an actual good quality show.  
 
Story : 10/10 (read the manga) 
art : 1/10 (oh please the animation make my eyes bleed) 
Sound : 7.5/10 (redeemable, its good) 
Character : 8/10 (it's same as the manga so it's good) 
Enjoyment : 2/10 (The bad quality animation is greatly destroying the  
                          enjoyment) 
Overall : 3 (ban Toei please)

    *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS* 
 
Right now the show is 694 episodes in and, looking back, I have no idea how I caught up to all of it. 
Honestly I think most of the reviews of what's wrong with this show are pretty accurate.  I love it to death but damn it has some major flaws.  A few good things though.  I personally like the art but I know a lot of people don't.  The world is imaginative and very creative especially when it comes to Devil Fruits and the creative ways people have been able to use their abilities.  Read the other reviews if you want a complete run through of the show but I'm gonna name a few things that personally bugged me/ pissed me off. 
 
Things that bug me: 
1. This anime has become DREADFULLY SLOW.  Nothing gets accomplished in the episodes because its mostly based on the opening and recaps of past episodes.  For example, right now Zoro is STILL fighting Pica.  WHY?!!! Pica was no match for Zoro from the get so why are they still fighting?  That fight could've been wrapped up in one episode but its been going on for like 5-6 episodes now.  I feel like sometimes I can skip certain episodes because nothing is happening. 
 
2. The wacky ass looking villains.  Every single villain thus far besides the marine officials look like complete and utter retards.  I'm not saying they don't have cool powers but by god they just look ridiculous. 
 
3.  No one dies in this anime.  Well, correction, people only die in flashback.  Ace and Whitebeard died but that was just to further the plot.  Whenever a character has a backstory you can always assume that someone close to them is going to die.  Other than that, everyone seems to be fucking immortal.  You remember that bird guy in the Alabasta Arc who took an atomic bomb to the fucking face? HE WALKED THAT SHIT OFF IN A COUPLE DAYS!!  How about that old man in the skypiea arc who got hit with Eneru/Enel's huge ass lightning beam AND SURVIVED?!!!!  But the biggest anomaly has to be Zoro and the amount of blood this guy has lost.  I don't care if you want to say ""his determination drives him to live"" or ""this is an anime so things get exaggerated"" this guy loses 99.9% of his blood all the time but always recovers in a few days.   
 
4.  Too many characters.  You remember when it was only Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Nami, and Sanji on the ship?  Everyone got equal attention and we fully understood what each character was thinking and feeling.  Now its a complete wreck.  There are so many  characters on the team and off that no one has time for any character development.  All the straw hats are pushed aside and are mainly only around for comedy purposes that aren't really that funny.  All the side characters in each arc do most of the work in helping the crew since they are ALWAYS divided.  I'm not saying I hate these other characters since most of them are pretty badass.  I'm saying that theres just way too many. 
 
5. This isn't really a problem but its definitely one of the biggest things that bug me about this show.  So in this world there are pirates, sea monsters, sky people, fish people, and special fruits that give special powers.  Thats all perfectly fine I don't have a problem with that.  However, the way One Piece's logic supposedly goes, only people with devil fruits should be powerful and every regular person in the islands that they travel to should just be normal people.  If thats the case then how come people without devil fruits are so fucking powerful?.  Luffy ate the gum gum fruit so he can stretch, but that doesn't explain why  he's so goddamn strong enough to break a fucking ship with his foot.  I wouldn't mind this but people without devil fruits, whether they be regular pirates or citizens, are portrayed as people with normal human limitations.  Therefore, it makes no sense that Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, or anyone else could be that strong just because they ""trained for a long time"".

    One piece is a classic anime, brilliantly done with an amazing creative flare for imagination by the author. It is set in a fictional world that is divided into 4 major oceans (East, West, North, South) which meet in the centre in a place called the ""grand line"". This is supposedly a legendary place where very powerful pirates live and constantly search for the great treasure of the deceased pirate king, ""one piece"". 
 
The story follows the life of a teenager, ""Monkey D. Luffy"", who has the ability to stretch his body in any way and holds the properties of rubber. He is an extrovert character who is both stupid in personality, eats way too much food and is completely unreasonable when he wants something. His personality is almost equal to that of Goku from Dragonball, Naruto and Natsu from fairy tail. This criticism exists that one piece is another shounen anime with the same stereotypical protagonists. This is true, however, it is still the great original shounen anime and if you enjoyed any of the above you will love this one too. 
 
The anime is quite old and currently has over 650 episodes, this makes starting the anime for some people non viable due to the old graphics not being in tip top condition. YOU GET USED TO IT; and the graphics improve over time. There are tonnes of mysteries in this anime that are still being debated (which i will not spoil). 
 
Character wise there is great versatility and for some of you anime lovers there are parts where the ecchiness and comedy gets off the charts, but because Luffy is a character who doesn't understand the concept of ""mature relations"" (*cough...sex) they do not develop. 
 
If you want to watch a great anime with incredibly interesting fights and imaginative powers (called devil fruit powers in their world. E.g. control of the elements, alter your body, create earthquakes, control shadows etc...) then one piece is right for you.

    Since the last review I wrote was a little overwhelmed by my fan-boying crap, well it was the first one I ever wrote tho, and I decided to be a little more objective about writing a review about One Piece. I, myself, really adore this one, but people mostly underrate it because it has many episodes, or is a little bit old. Anyways, let's begin. 
 
Story - 8/10 - The story is focused about Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who lived in the era known as ""The Great Age of Pirates"", which was encouraged by the great Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Altho the anime is really old(began airing in 1999), the story is very well writen, by my opinion. It currently has 683 episodes and is still ongoing and like every anime that has a lot of episodes, it does have quite much fillers indeed, and they can be really annoying I admit that. It also has somekind of a unique story, and that pirate theme is really awesome in some ways. You don't see much animes that have the pirate-theme in them. As I was saying, the story is really unique. Now, that were mostly pros of One Piece, but it has a few cons aswell. Like, the plots aren't such good ones, they're mostly predictable. This wasn't a spoiler, it was just a fact. Altho i watched every single arc from the beggining till the end, some of them aren't really needed there, they're fillers put in that way. 
 
Art - 6/10 - I rate the animation of this anime on a 6. I've taken into account that this anime dates from 1999, but even now the animation isn't such high-quality. Even if it is available in 1080p HD, it isn't very admirable, so I rated it a 6. 
 
Sound - 7/10 - Aswell as the animation, the sound in some point in the anime is really bad, and at some points it's really good. If we take OST's and openings into the account for sound, I say that they add quite a bit to the total experience of One Piece. 
 
Characters - 8/10 - I think that the characters were really made up well, and that he added just what it was needed to make them compatible with eachother by making them all share the same horrific past. Some people may think it's a little bit of exaggerating, and I think so too, it isn't very realistic for them all to have traumas from their childhood, or to bear scars, but that's what he did so the characters could've bonded through the anime by experiencing ""hell and heaven"" with eachother. I approve of this in my own way. 
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 - I give it a total enjoyment of 8. It is a little bit different from a regular Shounen anime, but what made me give it a 9 is just because I enjoyed watching every second of it so, so, so much, even if it were fillers. It had a lot of emotional scenes aswell that I still like rewatching from time to time. If I was more objective about this, and if I considered other people opinions about this, I would've said it's a 6 or a 5. But I simply don't think that way, and I may have fan-boyed it a bit on the end, but hey, I really liked this anime tho. 
 
Overall - 7/10 - I'd give it a total of a 7. It's a very objective view about it, if it was myself I'd give it a 10, but honestly, it doesn't deserve it. If you look through the grades I've been giving all over, it has to be a 7 overall. If you're gonna watch this anime you should be prepared for the bad animations for about 300 first episodes, then it sharpens up a bit i think, and gets at about 720p, but it all comes down the the personal opinions of people, if you like this type of anime I don't think you'll mind the animation much. Also, I forgot to mention, it has quite a few movies(12 or 13, can't remember straight now) and a couple of specials. 
 
I think I've written a better review than my last one, and thanks if you read it to the end.

    Let me start by saying that i also though that an anime about a guy made of rubber with a hat made of straw seemed pretty dumb. 
 
One Piece is about Luffy whose ambition is to find a treasure, One Piece, and become the King of Pirates. To achieve that, he assembles several friends along his journey and has to face many strong opponents. This anime is VERY addicting and after watching a dozen of episodes you will want to watch all of them for sure. 
 
Normally, its quite a comical anime and with lots of fights. Nevertheless, it has some more serious parts that make it an outstanding anime and gives it more intensity.

    At first you think that One Piece is a typical Shonen with ridiculous fights and shitty drawing. In fact, these two never improve. But there are things that make One Piece soooooo... much better than Bleach, Naruto and even Hunter x Hunter. And these things are the story, characters, foreshadowing and the unique One Piece universe. There are also nice concepts about will inheritance, man's dreams and giving up personal goals for the sake of close friends/relatives. 
 
Ok. So here are my scores: 
 
Art: 0/10 
Music: 0/10 
Fights: 0/10 
World design: 0/10 
Characters: 10/10 
Story: 50/10 
 
So Overall: 60/60. Deal with it. 
 
The problem with One Piece is that you need to understand all these foreshadowings, concepts and not complain about PIS's (Plot Induced Stupidities) which can be quiet difficult. So there will be a problem if you are mature enough to see all the stupid and ridiculous things but not mature enough to enjoy the good things. 
 
P.S. 
Sorry for the bad english.

    Oda Eiichiro is a genius! The story of One Piece is outstanding great: 
The East Blue arc: 
The Buggy arc make you laugh into a K.O. 
In the Kuro and Don Kreig arc you understand: this is just the begining. 
The Arlong arc make you crying on Nami's past. 
In the Log Town arc you know: it's time for new, epic adventure on the Grand Line. 
 
The Barock Works arc: 
Adventures on the ""Little Garden"" crash you, you know: there will be more and more exiting adventures! 
Chopper's history make you heart full of tears, you cry and cry. 
The episodes with Arabasts make you remember the desert, you know that's isn't all! 
 
The Skypia arc blow you away in the sky and make the story much better and exiting! 
 
The Water 7 arc: 
The begining is very nice! The battle with Aokiji make you understand: Luffy isn't the strongest! The island ""Water 7"" give you so much beauty and you now know: One Piece has not problem in technologie!The intrigue with Robin, Iceberg, Franky and CP9 make the anime such exiting! 
The brave act on the tower of juctice made you more brave, you are not scary of the government. 
Robin's past made you crying even more, than Chopper's, you are taken in the drama, full of sorrow. 
The battles are so exiting!  
In the end of the arc you cfn understand: Oda IS a genius!!!! 
The Thriller Bark arc make you laugh with Luffy at the comic horror! 
The Sabaody make you cry at the last day of the Mugiwara team, but then it's going the Impel Down arc, with more funny actions and old friends, like Buggy, MR2 and MR3! 
The Marine Ford arc make so crying at the Ace's past, at Luffy, when Ace die, he has lost 2 of precious brothers! 
So overall the story is outstanding! 
 
The problem of the art is Hencok! Animators are mock the art of Oda's Hencock doing her very ugly! Overall it's great, it could be outstanding, but Hencok... 
 
The sounds are very good! The good of the sounds are Gomu-Gomu attacks! The sound where his arms are stretching in the sky  is outstanding! The openings and endings are great! So, overall 8.5 
 
Characters are amazing! Hencock, Jango, Moria, Luffy, Usopp, Buggy, Garp and others are so amazing!!!! They're really great! Outstanding! 
 
I love so much One Piece because he is so enjoyble! That's great adventure from East Blue to the end of the Grand Line, searching One Piece is outstanding! Oda made the main theme of the anime so cool! Luffy traveling many diffrent islands! It IS amazing! He is doing all islands so diffrent, and so diffrent characters! Amazing! 
So, overall it IS the best anime, so 10.999999!

    In short One piece has been beating a dead horse for about a decade now I see quite a bit of overhyped fans on here, I'm afraid it's just anywhere close to the hype anymore. Lets start with the story.  
 
Story. 1/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. Ridiculous Pirates go on Ridiculous adventures is how I would sum it up, add in a couple of cheap laughs and cheap emotional segments and you have summed one piece up.  
  
Art. 2/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. 
 
Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. 
 
Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. 
 
Enjoyment. 3/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... 
 
overall this series has been dragged on way too long, and for me personally has lost it's appeal long ago, I just had to drop it. However every now and then I will watch it on Toonami for a few cheap laughs other than that i highly recommend you stay away from this anime it just is way to over hyped and they are just beating a dead horse at this point.

    One Piece is one of the Greatest! Anime series out there in my opinion..with cool, loveable, funny and especially strong main characters, in more ways than one. 
 
Friendship is one of the most important values in this show, and this anime has always managed to make a smile on my face and at times inspired me in many ways. Which are a couple of reasons why i like this Anime. 
 
I really love this anime, and i am very grateful to Eiichiro Oda-sensei for creating this wonderfull masterpiece of his. 
 
If you haven't started watching this anime yet, i strongly reccomand it to you. 
 
(And i'm talking about the original Japanese version. I do not recommend the 4Kids English Dub version. The 4Kids English Dub version will only give a bad impression of the anime, and doesn't make much sense.)

    omg, you have to watch this!!!! but not the dub. o god pleze do not watch the dub. and if you have seen the dub, then you're probaly thinking , o, this show is probably too chldish to enjoy, but believe me, it's not! i mean, one of the great things about one piece is that it is always watchable and exciting. it has serious moments and emotional ones, but it never becomes too much of a drag. the main tone of the show, even in a fight scene, is light and humourous, with just the right amount of seriousness needed. and the characters are fabulous!

    Ok, since there are so many reviews for One Piece, so I'll try not to rehash the usual stuff. This review will more like why you should watch one piece. 
 
Story: 
If there is one word to describe One Piece's story, I'd pick ""GRAND"". 500+ episodes and it's only 1/2 to 2/3 of the way there. The story is about Luffy who wants to be the Pirate King, so he set sail to Raftel which holds the treasure called One Piece. In his journey there, he picked up nakama (comrades) and meet new people along the way. 
 
Some of the islands that they stopped by are: 
Desert kingdom 
Winter island 
Prehistoric island  
Venice style waterworld 
Sky islands 
Haunted island 
Amazon style women only island 
Fishman island deep under the sea 
 
The formula is somewhat standard, where you will discover the past of the island, and Luffy will fight the strongest enemy to help the islands. However, each island's story and characters are unique so it's a new adventure every time they set foot on an island.  
 
Mysteries: 
Besides the main plot, there are also some side mysteries that keep viewers guessing and spawned hundreds of forum posts. Luffy's father, ancient weapons, void century, what is One Piece etc. These are unraveled slowly and tastefully along the way. 
 
Characters: 
This is where One Piece shine the most. The characters are some of the most unique and wacky of all the anime/manga I've watched. You will laugh, cry, and feel for them. The main characters will grow, but their personality is consistent throughout the anime. 
Some characters who ate the Devil Fruit are given unique abilities. Like Luffy's rubber ability which allow him to stretch his body, or Ace's flame ability to allow him to turn into flame. 
 
Final words: 
If you have not watched One Piece, you might be overwhelmed by the sheer number of episodes. However, it's a blessing that you can watch One Piece non-stop while those who have caught up are waiting agonizingly for 1 episodes per week. Give One Piece a try and you might discover why One Piece is the most popular manga series in Japan.

    One Piece is the best shounen anime ever made. Hands down. No contest. Bleach, Naruto, Gintama, and all those others have nothing on One Piece.  
 
What you got is an EPIC story. 
What you have are AMAZING characters. 
What you see is COOL art and animation. 
What you experience are AWESOME levels of entertainment. 
 
You can't even say it's a competition about which is the best anime. This is it. One Piece is IT.

    This is one of my first reviews and I'm going to try to be as least biased as I possibly can. 
 
One Piece, without a doubt, is a very close contender for my favorite anime. I gave it an overall 8, and the only definite 10 I will ever give out is Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. 
 
Story: 
 
I gave One Piece an 8 in the story for many reasons. One Piece has some amazing arcs and sagas. The background, foreshadowing, and character development is amazing, and can leave you in awe. Some arcs however, are very long and drawn out, and can leave you with arc fatigue.  
 
I felt like the Skypiea arc was too long for its own good. It didn't have that rich character development you usually get from One Piece. By the end of it, I just wanted to move on to the next arc as quickly as possible.  
 
Thriller Bark was not as long as Skypiea, but it was very bland until the very end.  
 
Arcs like Arlong, Marineford, and Summit War stand out because they are the best points in the whole story. These arcs are well written and have lots of character development. These arcs have a lot of flashbacks which help create the characters. 
 
Another major point in One Piece is that the story is not always serious and edgy. The characters have their own gags and a fight that normally is serious could have some funny spins on it. The beginning of arcs and end of arcs are usually more funny, but their is always room for comedy in the middle. 
 
Art: 6 
 
One Piece has a problem that a lot of shonen anime have. The art style is very sloppy and are drawn in very different ways. The unique thing about One Piece's art style is that you rarely get the same type of body on every character. Dynamic characters are usually drawn differently from the basic characters which make them stand out. 
 
Crab walking. It happens A LOT. One Piece characters aren't always shown doing this, but it really hits a nerve when it happens. Sometimes, a character will be drawn walking with his knees bent in different directions. Some people say its just a part of his Oda's art style, but it still isn't appealing.  
 
Something that is not terrible are the way he draws the heads. Some characters have lemon heads, some have normal heads, and some characters have bowling pins for heads. It really isn't that big of a deal, but if you are REALLY picky about art style, this could be a big turn off.  
 
Sound: 10 
 
One Piece is the only anime that I've watched where i felt like the soundtrack is very fitting. It can be very light at times and also very serious. It's also unique because most of the soundtrack is orchestra and piano. You don't often get a lot of guitar like Bleach or Naruto. 
 
The overall sounds during fight sequences are very well done. The punches are not to fake sounding, and the Devil Fruit sounds are pretty spot on too. The Japanese voice actors are fitting, and if you watch shonen you will probably recognize some of the voices.  
 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
Like I said before, One Piece is well written and at times the arcs can go very fast and sometimes they can go very slow. I believe that if you make it through the slow parts, you will get to good story lines. It is a very rewarding anime to watch IF you are willing to put the time in.  
 
Overall: 8 
 
A lot of people are turned off by the high episode count. The one thing I say about anime is that you can't judge by how long it is. One Piece doesn't have one major plot, the anime is mostly about Luffy's adventure as a pirate. Each arc has its own plot that sometimes tie into other arcs and become saga. Until this day we don't know if there is going to be an end game opponent.

    ok where to start hmmm.... 
 
the first anime i saw was naruto and after watching all the eps i thought that naruto was the best anime. But by the time i was watching 1 ep a week i started watching bleach. The same thing happened again because i was watching 1 ep a week of bleach and naruto. So, i then started watching one piece (thank god there was enough episodes to keep me going for a while) and to this day i realised that out of those 3 anime one piece was the best and my favourite. 
 
What makes One Piece so great? 
The storyline is good and keeps you guessing to what ""One Piece"" is but then you realise it doesn't matter because the journey is what matters the most. 
It has a great balance of happy and sad. There are alot of times where i have shed tears but also times of tears of joy - this rarely happens in other anime. 
The characters aren't overpowered. This is essential because it adds a sense of realism. Roronoa Zoro is my fave character but he has no devil fruit which makes it more awesome. 
EPIC. It is the most EPIC anime i have seen so far. 
Oda (mangaka for one piece) doesn't overuse death to create emotional scenes. I think this is much harder but it makes it feel more authentic and not cheap. 
Nakama/Friendship. This is probably the best quality of One Piece. Even though Luffy and co are pirates, they will help people because they are good people and value friendship. The Strawhat team pwn. 
Comedy. Yes there are some funny gags :) 
 
What makes One Piece suck? 
The 4kids dub or whatever. stay away from dubbed and stick to subbed. 
That's about it i really can't fault anything else. 
 
P.S read the manga it's really good too

    One Piece was the second anime show i stared watching(the first one being Death Note) and ever since i started i have been a huge fan of both the storyline and some specific characters. 
 
Story: The story of the series unveils around the main protagonist's main ambition to become the King of Pirates, in a world that is ruled by a mysterious government that has five elders at the top. The world of One Piece is unique. It bears no similarity to any other world i've seen in other anime shows, as it is mostly comprised of 5 oceans (along with the Grand Line, in which the treasure is said to be hidden). The man said to have the most freedom in the world is the pirate king because he is not bound by the militaristic government led by the organization of the Marines. And so Luffy sets sail in order to find new nakama for his crew and eventually become the King, with many adventures lying ahead of them. 
 
Art-Sound: The animation techniques could be improved but are quite nice nontheless. The OST's released for each season are quite amusing in my opinion and also quite famous in Youtube. 
 
Character: Probably the most astonishing domain in One Piece is the variety and complexity of the developed charactes. Since the beginning of the storyline many different and unique characters have been shown making it easy for any person to match themselves with one of them and become obsessed. The protagonist  as well as hin nakama illustrate many moral issues and relationships such as friendship, protection of beloved one's, loyalty, trust etc. Also many difficult situations develop such as betrayal. However the combination of different and at all times strong-willed characters makes all of them wasy to like. 
 
Enjoyment: In my opinion anyone watching One Piece has a great time enjoying both the battles and the relationships developed between the characters. Many different abilities are shown via the Devil Fruits,which grant each person an ability. One can be eaten by each person. Until now over 100 different devil fruits ave been shown making the battles interesting and mysterious as one is eager to know the other;s fruit abilities and weaknesses. 
 
I would give the overall score of 10 to One Piece. It is probably my favourite anime  due to its characteristics and the fact that i am obsessed with Luffy. I hope i helped with my review. Thanks for reading, please do comment on your thoughts about this review!!

    This is my first review ever. :) One Piece is one of the best animes I've ever seen because it includes a great plot, amazingly funny characters(especially the main characters), and it has many episodes. 
Throughout the anime, Luffy, the main character meets different people who eventually became his crew mates to go on a journey to find a treasure called One Piece, but as you watch more and more, the plot gets more exciting, complicated, and you'll begin to become a bit anxious for the characters because stronger characters, that are stronger than Luffy, will appear. Overall, this anime has everything: strong & smart characters, A LOT OF COMEDY

    First of all, let me start off by saying that One Piece ! is one of my favourite animes and manga of all time, and before you decide to not watch it, read the reviews ! 
 
One Piece is by far the most outrageous, amazing, tear jerking, hilarious, life changing animes.  It seriously makes me want to drop out of school and become a pirate. 
 
If you think that this is extremely shounen and that girls will not like it; you're extremely right for the first bit.  I'm a teenage girl, and I swear, I would choose One Piece over every other shojo anime out there. Sometimes shonen animes are the best. 
 
[STORY] 
 
The story is intriguing from the very start.  We see this little skinny kid who looks like nothing special, but then *BAM* he shows you what he can do.  If you've read the summary, you'll get the jist, except that the summary leaves out one VERY important detail. 
 
DEVIL FRUIT ! 
 
These are basically fruit that give the consumer powers, and as you watch the series, you will see the most stupid sounding devil fruit, turning out to be the most powerful creation ever ! 
 
The story is funny, but is sserious at times.  There are times when I cried my eyes out, and there are times when I died laughing.  This anime is non-stop hilarity and can not be described any other way. 
 
 
[ART] 
 
The art for the first 200 episodes or so is not the best quality, but is still equally enjoyable.  DO NOT COMPARE THE DUB ART TO THE ORIGINAL.  It has been modified for children etc. and looks absolutely stupid. 
 
Eiichiro Oda's art is often compared to 'Fairy Tail' another shonen anime, but they are both amazing. 
 
The design of the characters is both funny and amazing.  They are so unique and I know I would never be able to compare them to anything else. 
 
[SOUND] 
 
please note, this is for the SUB. 
 
SONGS are amazing, lyrics are truly heartfelt and funny.  They set the story very well using songs and openings etc. 
 
Characters voices are magical, whenever I was reading the manga I had a clear idea of what the voices would sound like, and I'm happy to saw my expectations have been met. 
 
[CHARACTERS] 
 
BEST part of One Piece is how unique and special the characters are.  They are not all 'my mother/father died when I was young and now I wander the seas', no, they are all truly heartfelt, sad stories that are only similar in how heart wrenching they are. 
 
Every back story, every flash back I had truly felt sad at, and it took an extra 3 episodes to un-break my heart ! 
 
[ENJOYMENT] 
 
If you haven't read any of my review, here's a basic shortened version of it; 
 
BEST. ANIME. EVER. 
 
[OVERALL] 
 
Simply the best.  Couldn't ask for a better anime.

    I think the question as to whether you love or hate One Piece has already been answered for most people, myself included. So in this review I don't really want to focus on One Piece as a whole, but rather the half of One Piece that I like to call ""Toei Timeskip."" Whether you love or hate One Piece, it's really hard to deny that its current state is a fucking travesty right now. Damn I'm pretty sure I'd even give pre-Toei timeskip an 8 if I could, but I can't because everything afterward goes down the drain. I was tolerating it for awhile, but they really went full Toei on the Dressrosa arc so my patience has run thin on this anime. 
 
The most glaring issue to me is the pacing. Regardless of whether or not you care for the quality of the show, I'm sure you still want to at least watch some damn anime at the end of the day. Yet you have to go through roughly 5 minutes of the Toei logo, long ass theme song, and the narrator recapping the last episode. Then when you get to the actual show, it's just another 4 minutes of the same shit you saw last episode until it finally gets to the actual content in One Piece. And even then, the actual content might just be a flashback episode or a bunch of unnecessarily drawn out talking/running scenes. I can't tell if this was a ploy from Toei so they wouldn't catch up to the manga as fast or if it was just a way to fill up the 22 minute segment but either way it's infuriating as hell. I just want to watch some goddamn anime, not ""One Piece: Recap Central.""  
 
Another issue is the animation. I have no idea how it got this way. I'm not gonna speculate on whether or not it's because of Toei's big work load on other anime or if they stopped caring, but either way it looks awful. There's so many reused stiff animations that look like super floaty, almost as if the characters all have a devil fruit that lets them fly. It's clear that Toei can do better as their opening themes and movies have good/great animation (second gear in the movies looks orgasmic), but for some reason we are stuck with this animation for now and it looks like it isn't getting any better. To top the animation off, the cheap sound effects make it even more unbelievable. So many sounds are reused that you'll notice it even if you aren't trying to listen for it. Most sounds have this weird static effect attached to it for some reason even if the attack does not call for it. It takes all the impact out of the attacks, the only thing that gives the attacks any impact at all is the VAs which arguably is the only thing carrying One Piece right now.  
 
It's a shame that One Piece is in this state cause it's one of the Shounens I have the most passion about. In its current state it is just a solid 4. I'd recommend reading the manga if you care about seeing the story without any of the bullshit that Toei puts in between. One Piece is really awful right now and I hope it improves in the future.

    Just to get this out right away before this review. This writing will not consist of anime or manga differences, rather you choose to immerse your self into this epic journey by reading the manga or watching the anime is your preferential decision. Personally I am more of a fan of anime then manga, but the manga is a fantastic read if your a manga fan and only like following the main plot points. Also this review will not explore dry details and things that most people should probably already know like the premise of the story or characters at this point since its been running for 20+ years. I will focus instead on outlining the major strengths of this series and reasons why you should jump in.  
 
Good with that being said, lets get onto the review shall we..... :) 
 
 
One piece is another well respected and ambitious shonen series especially in Japan. It is currently the leading crown jewel of shonen in its home country and the most popular manga in the world. Believe me if there is any shonen series out there that deserves this recognition, it is one piece. The series has some of the most incredible cast of characters you'll ever see and witness and some of the most groundbreaking and dramatic backstories along with a very deeply crafted and Imaginative expansive world just full of beauty. There is even a level of poetic heroism that you won’t see in any other shonen that is so unique to oda’s style of immersing you into the experience and helps to establish your connection to these characters and the story presented. 
 
Helmed by Eiichiro Oda himself, the author of one piece has a level of commitment and confidence to his manga that you don’t often see in many mangaka’s careers. One by one Naruto, bleach, fairy tail, hitman reborn, magi. They all fell apart at some point, usually towards the often unplanned or convoluted climax of a story. (Naruto’s 4th world war as an example, Bleach thousand-year blood war arc that kind of materialized out of nowhere and tried to connect events up to the present narrative, hitman reborn’s often un-executed final battle royal tournament arc, Magi’s ridiculous over the top philosophical ending) I have seen enough shonen in my day to truly judge the quality of these series and one thing all large ongoing shonen have in common is they are plagued by inconsistency both in the writing and themes and elements presented. This is a growing trend that is predominant in this genre. This is where one piece greatly differs in this regard. In terms of so many cliché and contrived stories seen throughout shonen or series that end-up derailing into unknown territory. This series really opened my eyes on the same level as like Hunter X hunter did.  
 
 Never does it ever feel like its derailing off track or contradicting its moral code, that is the mechanics and rules written that dictate the structure of the series and its universal principles outlined by the author. This sets the foundation of the many hundreds of episodes and continues along consistently with those established elements. 
 
 Naruto was once a series about Shinobi, kishimoto (the author of Naruto) developed and created his world to be a ninja world with various ninja tools, strategical warfare with many dynamic battles and even a certain degree of physics. Many elements of ninja were still a huge ongoing theme with a more personalized tale in the original Naruto series that conveyed a more humanized reflection in the presentation of the story. However, eventually that ceased to be as many characters became so godly powerful, that many of the traditional mechanics were just forgotten and characters lacked development and never ended up becoming the larger focus. I would have loved to see how kishi developed the weapons expert tenten, or the kind of creative techniques that shino could have used or even Lee becoming a more prominent character in the story. Tamari with her Wind techniques and blades. No instead many characters were reduced to mediocre persona’s living in the shadow of Sasuke and Naruto which are clearly the focal point of the character development and story. The power scaling in other words just felt a bit unorthodox or just uneven as many characters and elements of the series became obsolete.  
 
This is something that does NOT happen with one piece. Characters do grow more powerful as the series progresses, but its confined with-in the rules established and never breaks that barrier feeling like a deconstruction towards a different series. Each individual character be it main, secondary or even villains will go through lots of emotional and physical development.  
 
One of the largest reasons why I have such hope that the ending of one piece will be great, because this man has mapped out and has drawn the final arc of the story from literally a decade ago and has since dropped the bread crumbs often hinting or leaving subtle clues that tie and connect seamlessly to some of the deepest mysteries of the plot. In short you can feel that the show is building towards something with many lingering questions and answers that will eventually come to the forefront of this epic saga. I swear I have seen this show a lot and I am still picking up on certain foreshadowing that was conveyed literally hundreds of episodes ago which later became a huge plot point. This man plans so meticulously, that it literally boggles your mind.  
 
An example “said character will mention something just on the spur of the moment and you don’t think there is no significance to it, only to find out that later on, it is incorporated in the story in a major way with great development for that character and is also hinted subtly a few times throughout the story. Another example. “During a massive incident that shakes the world, you see many people discuss their viewpoints of the government or how the atrocities that took place in the world and their ideological viewpoints of the events. Some characters who you don’t think are very important merely have a few lines of dialogue, only to find out later that said character was a “LEGEND” and a very important historical figure in the one-piece world. Much like Madara or hashirama in Naruto. Oda loves to tease like this and with such subtly, it feels like this man knows exactly what is on the horizon and loves to throw in such amazing Easter eggs to see if viewers are really paying attention. This is also another reason why this series has a huge following of theorists and analytical reviewers.  
 
In terms of the art and style. The diverse and rich universe that oda creates with some of the most impressive world building and the ability to establish each new locale with different laws, cultures, morals, rules, etc. The often exaggerated display of facial expressions and abnormal designs can turn some people off but if you look above that exterior you will notice a unique style that is not used in any other anime with such a wide range of variety that is often hard to interpret just from mere words. Objects and characters represented in the one piece world are often large in scale and tower over the main protagonist in a way that makes you feel their dominance and control that the one piece world is full of such monsters and incredibly powerful adversaries. The significance to this design choice by oda is amazing and really exemplifies the massive threat level conveyed in this world. The anime actually makes this element of the series more prevalent. Also The type of scale the one-piece world has is unprecedented. You will never see a world with such rich lore and world building and oda gets a lot of his ideas from so many other novels, movies, historical references, etc. So, there is bound to be something that you will recognize from other iconic anime or films. Things like Alice in wonderland, The god father, Dragonball, Moby dick, to name a few. 
 
Don't be put off by the often classic style of animation if your watching the anime, because it will evolve over time. Obviously with a show that has started in the early 1990's and is continuing into 2019 will have some changes (sarcasm). Seeing the transition to 16:9 is where you can really see the massive difference.  
 
The Music definitely deserves a mention in this series. Without it, it would not be the same. The music suits the scenes of battle marvelously, it gives the people who's watching seeking for more and more action. The orchestrated trumpets and trombones, mixed with the drums fit the action scenes very nicely and the piano themes that you hear during some of the drama, really creates a powerful scene that is trying to bring out your emotion and just tingles your heart and soul. You really do feel for these characters as almost living in there world. Believe me, you will cry, you will laugh, and you will even get angry during some of the more intense dramatic moments in this show. The background music is also very capable of strengthening suspenseful or triumphant moments. There is just something about it that fits the story of pirates sailing to sea so well. 
 
 
With that all being said, I just want to say that one piece is not an episodic type of series, it is a massive serialization with an overarching narrative, but the core of the series is structured differently than Naruto for example. The series is a more of a character driven narrative and the mystery and lore take kind of a back seat for a while. There is a common misconception where people perceive this series as being very slow paced for that reason and the story does not move to the end goal any time soon but as i said, the driving force of the story is the characters them self's well the mystery and lore are conveyed throughout the journey. Eventually It will come full circle and you will just be in awe at how carefully planned out the plot really was by the ending. You can witness the many clues and hints outlined throughout the plot and details early on that have a ground breaking significance later in the story.  
 
In closing i want to say I know most people are turned off by it because of how intimidating it can be with its nearly 900 episodes and 900+ chapters of content and still on going. But rest assured this is not pokemon, it is a deeply well developed and expansive story with rich lore and world building and it’s about journeys, adventure and mystery that will sure to intrigue you to no end. Check this one out if you’re a fan of anything shonen.

    This is a new review; I found out after watching 29 episodes of One Piece, I realized I made the original review too early.  
Okay first off;  
Story: The story of One Piece is so much different to everything else I've watched, I like One Piece and gave the story an 8 because it's something I myself haven't seen something as planned out and consistent as this, although it has major flaws, for example the fillers... I'm kind of happy I haven't waited week-by-week to watch the 319 episodes I have currently watched,  I would of been disappointed to of been given 3 months worth of filler... Although; some of the filler episodes are very interesting and actually make you want to watch them, namely during the Enies Lobby Arc, I will not mention anything that can be classed as spoilers so I'll leave the story section of this review here.  
 
The art, On my first review I found the art to be very poor; not realizing that One Piece was released in 1999(The Anime) so I gave this a very low rating the first time, but as I have gotten further on with the story I have noticed many changes to the art and fighting styles all of the characters use and how much it has improved, and I'm not even up-to-date with One Piece, I literally can't wait to see the complete development of this series, although waiting every week for this show will be a killer.I rated the new art style an 8. 
 
The sound; I found the opening theme tunes well fitted for this series and a lot of work was put in, Usopp's songs and so-on so forth. The Opening theme tune is very catchy for every arc and makes you enjoy watching them from start to finish, it kinda makes you feel like watching more and more every time you hear it. The sound was rated an 8. 
 
Well, not on to the second most vital point of any anime I watch and write my reviews on... The Characters, I find the character development for One Piece amazing, you learn about every one of Luffy's Nakama's past and how they ended up where and how they are, wanting to achieve their goals and will stop at nothing to do so, and with Luffy as the captain, who says that's impossible?! This section I rated 9, as I have thoroughly enjoyed watching every character develop and seeing what they turn out like and how they can overcome the impossible on a daily basis.  
 
It's finally time, this is the most vital point in any type of anime you can watch - Enjoyment, with this whole series, the first 50 or so episodes, I thought about stopping; reaching a certain landmark and just carrying on when I can be bothered, I'm glad I didn't do that. This has instantly become a favorite of mine, making me WANT to watch more and I just enjoy watching almost every episode, I rated the enjoyment factor for One Piece a 9. 
 
Overall: 9 
I have given the overall summary of One Piece a 9 in my opinion, it's so amazing that I didn't think I would like this show; I took it on with a whim and I don't regret that one bit, One Piece teaches you so many life rules, abiding by your own justice and doing what you feel is right and not what the world thinks of it, if you think it's right, go at it whole-heartedly and you won't be disappointed with yourself, Luffy believes in his friends and Nakama to the bitter end knowing they are capable of overcoming everything and I find that the deepest bond between them all, it just sets everything in motion. I have enjoyed re-writing this review; I will leave my old review below for comparison for people wishing to judge One Piece too early, like what I done.  
 
-This review was wrote on Nov 7th 2013- 
""With this show, I've found that the art-work isn't as what I personally expected, I find that other long running shows have much better artwork, for example Bleach, or Naruto... Although I've only just started to watch this series, I can't see the artwork changing too much.  
 
I find that the story plot is quite impressive, looking for the most valuable treasure in the land on a huge journey, gathering members, and as of what I've watched, it's a decent pace for a long running, as it has been going since 1999, which is impressive in itself, 14 years?! That is a a standard in itself.  
 
I found the characters very interesting, like I said, I'm a new watcher so getting to know the characters very early is a good thing, the way Luffy obtained his most precious treasure and Zoro started to learn his three sword technique and their goals. I found that to catch my attention, and a lot of thought was put into these episodes explaining their pasts.  
 
I used to dislike the thought of watching One Piece, but I have eagerly changed my mind, last year I watched 3 episodes, got bored and switched it off, I have came back (Was looking for some new stuff to watch) and I don't regret it, I have enjoyed this show - Only on episode 29, but started 3 days ago(4th Nov 2013). 
 
I have rated the show an overall 9. I am enjoying it, but the thing I am most let down by is the art work, I understand that for a 1999 production, this is probably a lot more advanced, and brings me back to the times I watched Tenchi Kyo-Ryo-Ohki or, a personal favorite of mine; Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, they were, and still are excellent shows, even with their artwork, and I hope this turns out to be the same. 
 
Thank you for reading, I hope this is helpful to anyone looking to watch this anime.""

    OK this is my first review so here it goes, 
 
One Piece(OP) is a fantastic story about friendship, hard work, determination, and chasing your dreams. This show was one of the first animes that i ever watched and inspired me to continue watching anime. If you like idiotic humor, kick-ass action, and a touching story with very lovable characters, One Piece is the show for you. 
 
Story 10/10 
This story is all about the voyage of Monkey D. Luffy as he gathers up crew members and they experience many trials that will test their friendship and ultimately deepen their bond as they sail across the Grand Line. I love how this story develops early on as the original members are acquired. Not only are they accompanying Luffy and aiding him on his journey, but they are also chasing their own dreams as well.  
Now, about the oh so familiar fillers, compared to the other long running animes OP isn't jammed packed with fillers. In the beginning it moves pretty fast but as it catches up to the manga the story definitely slows in pace. Although there are less fillers, they are present but i found them to be very enjoyable. There are multiple filler arcs that last for multiple episodes but they fit in perfectly with the story. The reason these arcs are so enjoyable are because of the characters. 
 
Characters 10/10 
The main characters of OP are definitely my favorite part about the show. They all have great personalities that compliment each other. There are the idiot comic relief members,the voice of reason members, the bad-ass members, and the weak/support type characters of the crew. I'm not going to sit here and say that i love every character every episode; i've had my fair share of times were each has angered me in the way. But it's that exact feeling that makes you fall in love with the crew. Just like our own friends we have all had times when we hated our friends and its times like those that help friendships grow to be even stronger then before. The ups and downs of the crew as they grow to be closer nakama (a term VERY often used in the show) will have you yearning for more as you begin to hope for their dreams as much as they do. 
 
Sound 10/10 
Music is also a huge part of OP and adds a lot to the overall feel of the show. First off the opening songs for the show never disappoint and i find the opening to set the mood and can get you pumped each episode in a season. Not only are the opening songs fantastic, but each character has his own theme music. Each character has his or her own BGM that play when its his/her time to shine. 
 
Art 9/10 
OP's art is good and unique, that being said i still think it is a step down from other popular series (like Naruto or Bleach). By no means is it bad, i find its subtle uniqueness to be very appealing if you're looking for something a little bit different. I enjoy watching and couldn't imagine the characters portray any other way. 
 
Overall 10/10 
I love this show and it is definitely one of my favorites. It is a great shounen battle and i highly recommend it to anyone willing to take the 500+ episode leap. As someone who watched 415 episodes basically nonstop and has been watching it weekly ever since. It is never too soon, and never too late, to take the journey with Luffy and his crew across the Grand Line on a rollercoaster of emotion for the ultimate treasure ONE PIECE.

    Maybe it's a bit late, but this year I decided to catch up with One Piece. I have seen 296 episodes so I think (and hope) I am eligible of writing a review. My native language is not English so bear with me if I make mistakes of any kind. Also this is my first review. If someone would ask me to review this show in one sentence I would tell him the following: ""This show is a masterpiece"". I have to note that this review is solely based on my opinion and everyone has the right to have an opinion should that be bad or good. I am not saying that other people are wrong. So, let's start the review... 
 
Story 
 
The story is the greatest I have seen in a anime. It has a bit of everything: drama, comedy, action. At first it may seem that this is a comedy anime, but the more you watch it the more surprised you will be, because of the seriousness this show can deliver when it is needed. It has a perfect balance between comedy and drama. The story can be so deep that at some point you may even shed a tear. 
 
Art 
 
Despite of all the negative things people said about the art, I, personally really enjoy it. I can say that from the first episode the art was great in my opinion, but it keeps getting better and better after each episode. After I saw  some flashbacks of the first episodes I was really surprised of how much the art developed since then.  
 
Sound 
 
The sound of this show is really good. The OST (original soundtrack) really adds a good feel to the story. At the very dramatic moments it makes it even more dramatic, which is a really nice thing. 
 
Character 
 
One of the best thing in this show are the characters. The makers of this anime really made a good job bringing you close to the characters. I feel like I am on their ship, sailing with them and when they got some problems I can really feel their pain and suffering. The voice actors do a really great job (I watch it in Japanese version, I don't know about the English version, because I haven't seen it) and every character is unique in its own way. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
The enjoyment of this anime is outstanding. I could never get bored of it, because it keeps getting better every episode. Eiichiro Oda, the mangaka, does a great job in writing awesome stories with nice plot twists. 
 
Overall 
 
Overall this anime is a masterpiece. As I said earlier, I didn't write any review before this, but I felt this anime really deserved one and I wanted to express my feelings about it.

    I stressed enough as this anime is only ranked 58 on the list(LETS GET ONE PIECE TO THE TOP GUYS) 
ive either gotten several negative responses when i mention One Piece  
1- Its too long 
2- (usually mentioned by fan-girls) Death Note FTW!(which i dont think it derserves to have such a high rating) 
3- Ewww that anime is ugly 
4- naruto/bleach is better 
5- Ive seen the dub it sucks bawls 
Ill try not to write any spoilers and make it brilliant as possible 
Story 10/10 
Luffy a young 17 year old, who has eaten the Gomu Gomu Devil Fruit making him a rubber man, aspires to be the Pirate King, his carefree personality makes him the main character of the story and we follow him and his crew on his path to being the Pirate King, the great arcs one ive loved much was the Enies Lobby arc which was quite amazing 
Unlike certain Animes which have no ability kill anyone off One Piece has plenty of such things making the Anime an emotional one. 
I remember when i was 9 the dubbed version by 4kids was absolutely horrid i remembered no blood or anything to being with  One piece should get a a different dubbers infact without looking at the art to much or the voice acting i thought the story sounded quite great here i am watching it again 6 years later but this time on the subbed version, please don't watch the dubs,  
Art 10/10 
So what if the art is funny looking it fits like a glove onto the type of this anime one piece is funny its meant to be funny it should be denied because of art style i mean its more then 10 years old as we progress in the story my current time is 2011 the art get clearer  
Sound 10/10 
Every sound and background in one piece as id liked to imagine it fits perfect with the scene or current arc to make a scene sound badass or completely stupid 
Characters 10/10 
every character in One piece has a back story a childhood not one character is left out its deeply thought about and very deep, in most flashbacks which every different character usually has all the stories connect, every backstory ive seen so far is very touching and emotional thus making make score a 10/10 
Enjoyment 10/10 
Every battle scene in One Piece is Badass they always somehow try to beat there opponent no matter what its a common theme but no matter how much stronger the opponent they always have a resolve. 
Overall 10/10 
overall this Anime is really great i recommend it MAKE ITS NUMBER ONE ON RANK GUYS its really tempting i watch the entire series well i caught up to it in under a month. But one of my favorite arcs was Enies Lobby and if you cant wait once you caught up go read the anime

    A short reivew for the reader without much time: 
Story (7/10): The story is typical of a shonen anime, a team of friends going on a mission to find something they want. Each of the arcs are a battle against another pirate gang. 
Art (8/10): The art is what one first notices about One Piece. It is unusual and makes the series unique. However, people judge the anime for its art, and this doesn't do it justice. Just watch the anime, and you will notice the art works well with the anime. 
Sound (6/10): The music is interesting, and doesn't exactly match the anime, but is still a pretty good choice. 
Character (9/10): The characters are what make this anime. They are all unique in their personality and design. Their fighting techniques are all interesting in their own way, and all add to the comedy of the anime. 
Enjoyment (8/10): Highly enjoyable, very funny and entertaining. 
Overall (8/10)

    One Piece is one of those unique animes that stand out among thousands of others.Oda the creator, is one of the best of the best. 
 
 
 
PROS: 
-story and characters are well defined, as the story develops so does the characters. 
- each character is unique in different ways and each of them have different goals. 
-one piece is ""shounen"" it has a lot of action, comedy and emotional at times. never fails to disappoint. 
- sound is superb, creates an atmosphere which other animes fail accomplish. 
- ""Pirates"" one piece is one of the few animes who like to explore other cultures and isnt very traditional to the Japanese anime. 
 
CONS: 
- the only downside of one piece, is that the artworks are different than what most animes are use to. but it does not matter because its about pirates, not ninjas.

    i've been a fan of this  serie since  a lot  of years ago. I dropped the anime when it started the previous saga to the actual one (punk Hazard, i guess), that means that i hav not seen a single chapter in three years. 
 
This series could be a very huge one, but it has some negative things. 
 
- the development of the plot lacks completely  of  fluency. The narrative of the chapters got worse, more or less since... Fisherman Island. Oda is obsesed about telling what is doing every strawhat, and that it's quite tiring. If you substract the op, the ending, and the resume, the chapter will get reduced to 10 minutes. Surprise! It won't happen anything in that time. The thing that names the chapter will happen at the  last moment, so you'll have to wait another delicious week. 
 
-The obsesion of oda, of being always telling the past of the characters, olds and news. I found this aspect disgusting and pityful. Would not it be better, if you'd insinuate things about the character instead of let out all the information?  It's horrible being in the middle of a great saga, and  realize we have got involved in a 10-chapters flashback. I can understand it with the  main characters, but Oda NEEDS TO DO IT WITH EVERY ONE. I DO NOT CARE ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THEIR LIVES. 
 
Those two aspects, made me take a little..... 3 years break. I don't know if i will see it again. 
 
The art has become poorer and poorer. Neves have been an important thing, but some of the last chapters i saw weren't very well animated. And the Tits of Namy and Robin looks like an universe in continue expansión. Those two used to be, 2 sexy chicks. 
 
That's only my humble opinion. It's still a nice series, but i can't follow it week by week. Or my pity and disgust will overpass me and i'll became a monster. Probably. 
 
However, in general is fine. Music can be very surprising, there are very epic moments (and there will be) and each time i listen ''we are'' i only can say..... that crap was good (in the good sense)

    This anime is really the greatest i've watched so far. 
The way it has been drawn is very unique and simple and everything is very detailed. 
The story is great, imo better than Naruto &amp; Bleach.

    Story: One Piece plot follows a standard shonen formula; Monkey D Luffy, main protagonist, is a young boy who is chasing a dream of becoming a Pirate King. On a road to his dream, he encounters many different characters, some of which become his crew mates, enemies, allies and so on. To become a Pirate King, one has to be stronger than any other pirate and to get to the island called Raftel, where lies the biggest mystery of the anime, which is called ""One Piece"". Only thing we know about ""One Piece"", is that it is some kind of a treasure that last Pirate King, Gold D Roger left on Raftel, and for a vast majority of an anime, it was in question if it really exists. Anything more than this would be major spoiler, so this is as much as I can say about plot. Concept of an anime is fairly simple. Straw Hat Pirates are traveling from island to island in search for Raftel and One Piece, and every island has its own story, problems and characters, which sums into one arc. Pacing is pretty good, with arcs being long from 5 to 30 episode, depending on impact it has on the whole saga , with small fillers between major arcs. In general, anime starts off in a great way, with Luffy collecting his crew in first 5 to 6 arcs, and after establishing a full pirate gang, anime sets off to encounter some of the greatest enemies I have seen. It all builds up to Paramount War Arc, which is one of the greatest shonen arcs in my opinion. After that, anime goes into 2 year time skip, where we can see a great example of character, art and story progression, and its only getting better. Time skip brought us new standard of quality, with every post time skip arc is in one league higher than its pre time skip predecessors. Sagas have bigger number of episodes, all the arcs are really connected, which can be reflected in how taking down one enemy (as Doflamingo) has a big impact in things to come. So, for the story part, it would be a jeopardy to give it anything less than 10. 
 
Art/Animation: One Piece started at the end of 1999, so animation was somewhat sketchy and it was a turn off point for many of my friends whom I recommended it. It was not easy for me either, but as I was watching only Naruto at time, I had to watch something else while waiting for new episode. So, I dug in deep without looking back, and it paid off after an arc of two. Although it was not the most beautiful animation, it was unique. After some time, I did not even matter about it, because the story was so good. After few years in, anime was starting to look more and more good. Fights were looking better, world building was nice, water animation became good (which you imagine is important, because a big portion of an anime is set on water). And then the time skip came. Prior to time skip, animation was evidently on a good level, just watch paramount war, and you will see what I mean. But when the time skip hit, it was like a brand new anime. It must be said that after 500+ episodes, characters and anime as a whole need some refreshment. And boy, it was so good. After the paramount war, it was a bit calm, story needed little rest, and everything just went quiet. Time skip was a shaker in every aspect, and from then on, watching from just animation and art perspective, I have not seen a single flaw. One Piece is that cannot slack of with animation, as it has a lot of characters with many different powers, from fluid arm extending, over the sharp blade cutting and gun shooting, so variety of animation is a must. At this moment in time, Wano arc is few episodes in, and new comic-like art is just phenomenal, maybe the best One Piece had to this date. So, I will conclude the story of animation with a strong 9, because it will really reward you if you can survive first couple of arcs. 
 
Sound: Lets start with openings. One Piece openings are usually spoiler free, with just a glimpse of main event and enemies of the arc, with action filled sounds, right suited for a shonen. What catches my ear is that they all sound simmilar and are not that impressive,and as arcs can last for many episodes, so can opening, which can annoy from time to time. On the other hand, soundtrack variety that anime has is really great. Silly and casual soundtracks are pretty funny, which is great, but real deal comes with battle sounds. Every sound is really able to capture the moment, so on just hearing the soundtrack, you have flashbacks on some of the more significant moments, for example, moment when Luffy strikes a celestial dragon is jaw dropping and well rounded with awesome soundtrack (its called Luffy's Fierce Attack I think). Just because OPs are not that good (do not get me wrong, they are not bat, just not my cup of tea), I will give sound a 9. 
 
Characters: This is probably, besides story, where One Piece shines the most. It would be a horror if, in now almost 900 episodes, characters do not have proper back stories or progressions. Oda took his time and made every character different from others, which is really well exploited in pirate crew idea, where you need different people for different tasks. Luffy is clumsy captain, not very intelligent, but very warm hearted, strong and stubborn. While his looks do not tell much, just wait until battle starts, to see his abilities exploited at their maximum. He is that character that can understand everyone's feelings and can be there to help when you have a hard time. He is also that lawful good  guy, who does not have a problem with sparing enemies life or even teaming up with enemy, he is not a killer after all,  just a kid chasing his dreams. On the other hand you have Zoro, the Swordsman, Luffy's right hand and the first crew member Luffy has recruited. He was pirate hunter, but became a pirate himself after Luffy stubbornly persuaded him. He is that cold hearted, power-seeking guy, somewhat of a polar opposite to Luffy, and on the other hand, has moral laws that cannot be run over. He has does not care about women (at least that is what he is showing on the surface), has no sense of direction and other silly traits which need to be there to balance his cool personality, it certainly would not be cool to have a guy that is eponymous of awesome without any weight on his legs to hold him down on earth. Sanji, the cook, Zoro's arch enemy (metaphorically), is that pervy guy every good shonen needs, and oh boy, isn't he lucky with those chicks onboard his ship? Although being horny 24/7, do not dare to touch a woman in his surroundings, or you will experience the black leg style, Sanji's martial arts ability. Every other crew member is equally interesting, but lets sum this all up by saying that Oda really had done a great job with all those characters. Because every saga is pretty long, there is enough time and exposure for many side characters to be well covered as well, so they are pretty memorable as well. That might just be the case because of Luffy's befriending abilities, so in every arc Straw Hats makenew friend, who are often important helpers in later dangers that our protagonist find them self into. So, without a doubt, characters are getting a big 10. 
 
Enjoyment: I think it can be seen that I am quite moved by this anime, which is a case indeed, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. It may be long, but believe me, you wont be sorry about a single minute spent on watching One Piece. I was a bit reserved to begin with, but as time went on, and arc after arc was good, building up to paramount war and time skip, following only great arcs after that tend to be better than the ones before, I can say that enjoyment is guaranteed. Shortened versions I would not recommend, simply because you will lack in experience, because One Piece is not purely fighting anime, it has a pretty back stories and character dialogues that tend to be cut out in those shortened versions.So, without further ado, it is a big 10 for personal enjoyment. 
 
Overall: To conclude it, with arithmetic mean of 9,67 and a favourite bonus, I cannot give this anime any less than 10. Also, I cannot see this score falling down with things to come, as manga material looks promising, and new animation of Wano arc really brings something special in it, so I am really looking forward episodes to come.

    Hi there. This is my first review and i hope that most of you wil find it helpful.One piece is one of the best animes ive seen so far.I started off with naruto and bleach, and then later One piece after my friend told me about it.He was like&quot;Man there's this amazinggg anime called one piece that you should start watching, im alredy on episode 57,im hooked on to it,i cant stop watching ....BlahBlahBlah&quot;.So,when i got home i watched the first episode of OP and said&quot;wat the @#$%^&quot;.(at the beginning of the anime)The effects and quality( art )of the anime were horrible and the main character looked like a complete retard(to me).And i knew that there was no way i was gona get hooked on to this anime.I called up my friend and told him about it, and he said that thats what he also thought at first ,but after watchin a few episodes he completely changed his mind.So i decided to watch a few more episodes. Without even realizing it i was drawn into the anime(by the time you get to episodes 20-30 it gets intresting).The story got way better as i progressed through the anime and i enjoyed every single episode i watched. The characters also got way better. The main caracter (whom i thought was a retard at first) became my favorite anime character. He's cool (although he doesnt look it) and funny and will make you laugh so hard till you cry( this also applies to the other characters). Some fighting scenes(main ones)in the anime are INSANE, the music is beautiful,and the sad scenes in the anime will bring you soo close to tears( many people actually cried. i wsnt one of them....BELIEVE ME, I WASNT!!. but i got close to crying). The art and sound in the anime also get a lot better later on but you  wouldnt really care about them bcz youd be soo hooked on to the anime by the that time.I dont wanna write so much so ill just end this by saying that for those of you who havent started watchin this anime..START NOW!!! ,cause ull regret it if you dont.SAYONARA!!!

    One Piece - The ""Shonen Jump"" King 
 
I like One Piece. I like One Piece quite a lot in fact, but the issue comes from how insanely long the series is currently residing at 873 chapters and the staggering extent of its world which according to the OPW (One Piece Wikipedia) has named 870 characters.  
 
What I'm going to do is to explain what I consider some of the fundamental aspects of the series and so it comes the appeal of One Piece. I first encountered One Piece in 2015 on an anime event called Iberanime, in Portugal and unbeknownst to me at the time, what I was looking for was a mass success. I really came to enjoy the adventures of Nami, Zoro and of course Luffy as the first Straw Hat Pirates to appear (technically). The series had a unique place illness to it that made it stand out from other more shonen series I'd seen up to this point like Naruto or Dragon Ball and even the show's more dramatic moments there was a tremendous amount of fun to be had. Of course, as I read the imaginative pirate adventures within the first volumes, what I was completely unaware of was what a world shattering phenomenon I was actually dealing with and that revelation would only appear to me two years later when I find out what a massive deal One Piece really is inside Japan. 
 
The main appeal of this series is the simple premise of adventure and I know that's also the concept of countless other shounen series but nothing really captures the same sense of exploration and scale as the world of piracy, in the series. The hero on this voyage is a young pirate named Monkey D. Luffy, a basic character with a simple purpose to find the mysterious treasure named One Piece and with that, becoming the King of the Pirates. This is Luffy's primary motivator from Chapter 1 and remain until the latest chapter, and this keeps Luffy's journey along the one distinct path which is something unique to One Piece which is the same journey along the same path to the point that you can charge Luffy's route on a physical map (in which the crew encounters various island and territory) and this makes the story very easy to understand since allows to a massive amount of variety in the series sub-arcs like Baroque Works or Dressrosa in which the crew must untangle a web of political intrigue and take down a tyrannical false king, for example. The type of stories are unlimited since it started off fairly with a basic villain or villains but as we move on, people see the Straw Hats embroiled in government conspiracies or haunted ghost ships, jailbreaks and even being at the center of a large scale war like Marineford and this is what makes it the show. 
 
I really don't like some major plot incidents that are separate from the Straw Hats but when they occur, they reverberate throughout the world on such a scale that it drastically affects the lives of every character in it, such as my favorite character, Portgas D. Ace or the Yonko ""WhiteBeard"" (Shirohige) even though One Piece (as series) succeeds on a large scale. There are also a lot of very strong characterizations in the series, but one of the things that are a bit strange for anime and manga connoisseurs is the difference between the two versions where the 'x factor' of each person enters. For each person, the information they have so far is incipient phase what still remains to be known why everything is called into question. Because there is a lack of known and unknown information from the series, concrete examples can not be given with arguments, but it is a difficult problem to argue. The viewer is aware of what he sees, how the characters react (what is later compared to real personalities), and how everything that exists in the shape of the characters actually comes into being. From now, just trust me when I say that nobody writes a story like Eiichiro Oda and with that, you need to see to believe (that's an old Portuguese saying).

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~SPOILER FREE REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
This review is for those who think ""one piece is shit and think one piece is too long, so who's gonna watch it""..  
anyways, i have given episode guide in the last. :-)  
PLOT: 10/10 
among all the animes i have seen, One piece has the biggest plot among them all, the vastness of one piece plot is beyond measure as compare to other animes. 
Character Development: 
9/10 
(TO EACH TO THEIR OWN) 
Character development of one piece character is Dope. It's like when they are visiting new places, they are learning new things and understanding new people's feeling and learning about the truth of world government and crimes and injustice in this world. 
One thing i like the most about the theme of one piece is ""They don't follow the rules, they make their own rule"". 
+ one piece contains upto 500 characters and each one have their own character development. It's not just about hero being punching everyone in his way, they all have their own character development. 
Characters information: 
Monkey.D Luffy: (8/10) (Main character) 
Well.. About Luffy.. He's an idiot (no doubt :D ) but there are times when he made decisions which totally describes that why he's the captain in his crew and why others are not, despite the fact that each member of his crew have more intellectual level than luffy. 
""Sure.. He's an idiot, but that's why he's our captain."" ~Zoro 
Roronoa Zoro: (10/10) 
A badass three sword-style user swordsman and right hand of luffy. Though he have a bad sense of direction (almost too bad) but his morale value are way too much ! He is one of those character which will make you hooked to the one piece and loyal to it. (not gonna say much about him to avoid spoilers) 
Nami: (8/10) 
Navagator of the crew who has lust and greed for money. Probably the heroin of one piece (not luffy's fiance though, not even close). 
Usopp: (7/10): 
Usopp the sharp shooter (LOL exaggerated,) or should i say , ""Usopp the Lier"". 
Sanji (10/10): 
Cook of the straw hat pirates, who only uses legs in fight. (pretty badass ain't it?) 
(not including other characters to avoid spoilers). 
OST: 7/10 
Ost are decent , not gonna say they are awesome but some ost will make goosebumps .. <3 
Opening/Ending song: 7/10 
they are decent. For example: you can listen to ""oh we share the music"". 
Pacing: 6/10 
Now this is the major weak point of one piece. The pacing of one piece is quite slow. 
Animation: 6/10 
the reason why people say that one piece sucks is not because 
of the story, or the plot , or the character, it's the animation studio a.k.a toei animation that sucks. well the animation .... well to be precise: 
animation isn't on par with the dope plot and character development of one piece.  
(Well it keeps getting better and better though) 
It's still better than naruto though :3 
Gore: 6/10 
blood is quite shown in this anime but not like ""cutting in half, ripping head off"" etc 
Fights: 9/10 
THEY ARE DOPE. 
Overall enjoyment: 10/10 
believe me, once you are hooked to one piece, you can't stop watching. I'm not a one piece fan boy , I just state the facts. I was the same as you guys who didn't watch one piece but said it's shit .. but ! after watching it my review completely changed! 
Episode guide: 
So , what scares people the most is the amount of episodes of one piece which is 783 up to date (quite long though). 
and when people start watching early episodes they say "" this anime is not that good the way it is hyped""  
well How can you judge an anime which has 700+ episode by watching 10 to 20 episode? it's not even it's 10% episode ! 
so I'm gonna rate one piece episodes so that you can understand and make up your mind while watching it. 
Episode List: 
1 to 50: (6/10) 
50 to 220: (7/10) 
226 to 370: (8/10) 
382 to 491: (10/10) (yes! it's a 10/10) 
493 to upto date: (9/10) 
Keep these ratings in mind while watching one piece.

    I'm writing this review in the year of 2017. I will not bore you with a summary of One Piece There are three major setbacks that I find with One Piece and I'm sure many will agree with me. 
 
First, the pacing of this anime is slow. The OP is 2:30 minutes compared to the standard 1:30 minute most are used to. The recap of the current arc takes 3:00. Then there is a 2:00  
minute preview for the next episode. That only leaves 15 minutes for actual story.  
 
Second, the character designs is ugly. The villains have cartoonish appearances which eliminates any feeling of threat. The marines are basically fodder just like hollows is in Bleach. The only marines that could possible pose a threat to Luffy and his crew are the admirals. Whenever there are emotional moments it's totally destroyed by the silly facial expressions. Snot dripping, eyes bulging, mouth gaping, this is just unrealistic and hideous. 
 
Third, there isn't enough deaths in One Piece and when there is a death it's just used at a plot tool. I'm no saying I want everyone to die, but I'm saying that having people die due to the heinous methods of a villain will add more suspense.  
 
Also there are some things that need to be said about Luffy and his crew. I will first name the person and give my thoughts on that person.  
 
We all now Luffy is the captain, but he never acts like one instead he just eats, jokes around, and acts like an idiot. It's Nami that takes responsibility and acts more like a captain then anyone else. Personally Nami would be a better captain in terms of directing the crew through a thunderstorm or battle. She is the third smartest person in One Piece and clearly has expertise in navigation and weather.  
 
Ussop there isn't much to say about him since his character doesn't change one bit. He still lies and acts cowardly in the face of danger. He serves no role on the ship, except to make some gadgets and fix the ship if need be. Ussop isn't necessary for the crew, even though his compassion for others and loyalty is something to be admired. But let's face it, he couldn't save his friends despite him wanting to.  
 
Sanji well there isn't a doubt that he is a good chef and awesome fighter, but Sanji has this annoying quirk (Which you should know already). It's just a poor excuse for comedy relief. If Sanji was to get rid of that side of him then I would be content to have him on the crew. 
 
Zorro is awesome. I have nothing against him except for the fact that he is directionally challenged and has green hair. Zorro is essential to the crew as he serves as vice captain and is a master of the three sword style which cuts down fodder like a god. If it wasn't for Zorro then this show would be over. Love you bro. 
 
Nico Robin; she has a very tragic past (Like all the others only more tragic.) and it's easy to sympathize with her. I find her comments in the face of danger hilarious. Sadly Nico really doesn't do anything for Luffy's crew except dump exposition about ""lost history"" and snap people's necks. If anything though she is powerful due to her advantage of instantly killing people once she sees them. She would make a great assassin. I love you Nico but you don't really need to be on a pirate crew. 
 
Chopper; This lil' ol' fella is a mascot and nothing more. Yes, he serves as a doctor, but that's all. Besides he is a reindeer which just makes him look irresponsible for a doctor. Doctors are supposed to look professional and clean. Chopper is tiny and goofy. I wouldn't trust my life in his hands or hooves I guess.  
 
Brook; Again he has a tragic story and maybe on par with Nico Robin. Regardless Brook doesn't need to be on the crew for his only purpose is to tell cheesy jokes and play music. His jokes are funny at first, but gets old real fast until you just wanna rot in a cell and turn into a skeleton.  
 
Franky; I just wanna say this guy looks ugly! I'm gonna barf if I don't move on to the next character.  
 
One Piece; One Piece is a cool dude with amazing abilities. He has mastered all of the haki types, and can consume as many devil fruits as he wants. With just a stroke of his hand he can make berries turn into pure gold. One Piece is serious when it comes to fighting and he doesn't like to joke around much either. In my opinion One Piece is my favorite character.

    One Piece will be the kind of show that you are thankful to have continued watching. Like starting Madoka Magica, or Clannad or heck even Game of Thrones, it's something that only gets better and better. Unlike Bleach or Fairy Tail and Naruto, the first few episode doesn't immediately show-off an epic fight or get your pity--OP is pretty chill in the beginning. 
Take Anohana for example: in Anohana, the first 11 episodes were slow, but they were buildup for that last episode--the awesome last ep that squeezed your heart and tear-ducts dry. For One Piece, the story really starts rolling until they get five crew members, which is like 50 eps in. After that, 700 episodes of awesomeness awaits you. 
The core of the show is about wonder--Luffy wants to be the Pirate King because he believes that the Pirate King is the freest person in the World. He is a Pirate by his own standards, not killing or pillaging, and instead helping people with his life on the life cuz he freaking wants to. But there is so much more to this show--it's silly, it's light-hearted, it's dumb fun to watch all the adventures he and his crew go through. But still, some scenes are packed with much more meaning and personal stakes that makes it difficult to turn away.  
As much as I love One Piece, I recommend to stop watching the anime and switch to the manga when you get to the Dressrosa Arc. This is where the anime suffered due to stretching out the anime to converting one chapter per episode--diluting the tension of the show to zero. (Golden rule of anime is to convert two chapters of manga per animated episode). (You know, so the show wouldn't catch up to where the manga currently is and suffer the same problem as AOT/SNK and have to stop for 4 years). The Manga has fantastic pacing, it's only any of the adaptations, be it dub or sub, 4Kids or Toei that change the story. 
Become part of the OP fam. 
You're welcome.

    TO PEOPLE WHO CRIES OVER THE NUMBER OF EPISODES: GO READ THE MANGA. It's faster, addictive, beautiful background and still with funny jokes, and you waste less time with unnecessary frames of a character's face of suspense. Disadvantage: You'll loss the amazing and memorable seiyuu actors of each character, beautiful fighting scenes, and the amazing openings/endings they have. 
 
My introduction: I love One Piece since it aired on TV (Brazil) with few episodes. Besides the brazilian dubbing were extremely awful, it's story got stuck in my head: ""Did he already found One Piece? What it was?"". And then I found the sequel at Skypiea saga. 
 
OK LET'S GO 
 
Story (9): Every Island, and every character got deep story/past. the winning and funny moments gets repetitive to you give all your heart in it and then Eiichiro Oda can smash your heart and your soul with his hands. Some societies, government, objects also have deep story.  
   The thing really irritates me is the filler. Everytime they want to put a new monster/friend/enemy with unique powers and want strawhat's crew to solve it in a few episodes. Dude, to the story gets OK they have to kick enemy's asses, clarify mysteries, and let some message to spectators. YOU CAN'T DO ALL THIS IN FEW EPISODES IT GETS MESSY, that's why Oda's work last a lot of chapters. If they need to do a filler, make something off-story, nothing too deeper, just an episode for fun. 
 
Art (9): This part is where I'm really annoying. Look, I don't care about it's traces since they've changing a lot each arc, improving and getting better. But seriously, why is it getting so colorful? The tons of colors are getting annoying in background, and side characters that don't need it. Seems like the TV series are trying to convince children's audience to keep watching by adding a lot of vibrant colors. The only need to put a vibrant color was to a character with a significant meaning to the plot, and now it's in everywhere. It's cute but makes a unnecessary mess. This is one of the (dumbest) reasons I recommend people to read manga. That's my -1 for Colors. But +5 for improving traces, +2 improving attack effects, +3 Gorgeous backgrounds. 
 
Sound (9): The soundtrack are gorgeous, I would really love it if they use more of the old ones. Some sound effects seems already used from another series (like dragonball) and I don't have any reference of a remarkable original sound effect from this series that make me jump OH I KNOW WHERE THIS CAME FROM, only for OST. 
 
Character (10): GURARARARA. oh damn, characters. That's masterpiece seriously. Each one have a memorable lore, or habit, or laugh, even the shape of the body. Well, I can't say that for most female characters tho. Their costumes, clothes are unique. And oh my Lord, the seiyuu they choose for each character are REALLY accurate.  
 
Enjoyment (9): If you're watching few episodes, this is your gold moment to laugh, find those videos of funny moments strawhats and give them a like, but the jokes overeactions from characters are getting too repetitive in anime, but manga is still good. 
 
Overall (10): I know I rate mostly 9 in each type, but I'm giving it a 10 since there're few works that could achieve 5 types and combine very well together with few failures.

    A very good anime, with one of the best character constructions, AWESOME fights and bringing cool messages. 
The soundtrack combines well with the atmosphere of freedom of the anime, the ""abstract"" art makes the anime express itself better, very funny, character INCREDIBLY well worked and with sad/exciting moments that do u never stop crying... 
After the *** S *** (I censored to haven't spoilers ) it changed a little, but it was purposely. Oda give a shock of reality in the characters and, mainly, in the fans that... is not spoilers, right? 
""It's too big for me"" but, if you give a time of your day for watch, you will see all the episodes in a little time and, when you do it, you will say: ""fuck, i want more"" 
And that's all fellas, well played...

    I honestly dont know why this anime is so popular lets begin the review lets begin with the story I will say seems really interesting has a lot of potential but the story is about Luffy who wants to be king of the pirates and trys to make that dream come true with his growing crew. next the characters the characters seem very plain to be fair I really did not get to far into this anime the characters seem interesting with a cool back story if i could actual keep watching it which brings me into my next point is the filler/pacing of this show and this is where it so horrible I watch 23 episodes almost nothing really has happen to progress the story and doesn't really cover any back stories. the one thing I really like about this anime is the action and fighting scenes in this anime the sound and art are ok. Overall I really think I would enjoy this anime if there wasn't so many episodes and the pacing wasn't bad people say to read the manga instead it has almost no filler and the pacing is a lot better. I will try the manga out and review but as for the anime it seems to have a lot of potential but to much filler and pacing is god awful.

    This is going to be my first review. I wanted to do a review on One Piece to convince people that they should watch it. This anime will bring you joy and tears. You will be crying of laughter now and then. After you watched this anime you will have a different view on the world. One piece is a lot of comedy but it has a lot of dark and deep moments. 
_________________________________________________________________ 
 
So, before I am going to start this review I have got to say 3 things: 
1. Do not be intimidated by the amount of episodes, at first I was intimidated aswell. But when I started watching the time went by and before I knew it I was already on episode 300.  
 
2. There are some long arcs, the episodes feel slow and you want to stop watching. But, you got to keep watching. Do not skip any episode or you will miss some important details. You can never know what an episode has in store for you before you watch it. You can skip fillers, I recommend not doing so because there are not a lot of fillers in One Piece and most of the fillers are enjoyable.  
 
3. Stay away from the 4kids version. Do not go near it. 
 
_________________________________________________________________ 
I will try to avoid as many spoilers as possible in this review. Aight, I will type this review in 6 categories. Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment, Overall. I will start with Story. 
 
[10] Story: 
 
So, the reason I gave the story a 10 is because it is unique. Let me explain it a bit more detailed. As you may have seen on YouTube or on other social media platforms, there are a lot of theories on One Piece. The reason is because One Piece is such a big world with so much questions. Oda is really good in making the watcher wonder and think about the story.  
 
The story is about a boy named Monkey D. Luffy who wants to become King of the Pirates. Well, that sounds pretty cliche. That maybe true but you get my point after you watch it for yourself. Luffy's goal is different in it's own way. Let me give you an exampe, Naruto wants to become Hokage. That is that he becomes Hokage and than he is the Hokage. We already know what will happen. But for being the Pirate King we do not know anything. 
 
This was what I was talking about earlier. What is the One Piece? What is the secret behind the World Goverment? What is the ''Pirate King''. What is D.? What Devil Fruit has this (Character) So many questions but no answers.  
 
The serie is going for almost 20 years and a lot has been explained but the further we get into the story the more questions. We still do not know shit. After every arc we get another view on the world of One Piece and the characters. This is the reason I love One Piece so much. The mysteries, the hype, the characters, the deep scenes, the agony, the joy. Everything about it. 
 
The backstory's and flashbacks are amazing aswell. You are really curious about the past of most characters. The bounty system is amazing aswell! You are really happy when the character you like gets a new bounty. 
 
I do not really think there is any more to say. You really need to see for yourself without me spoiling anything.  
 
[9] Art: 
 
The art is really unique, this is one of the reasons I love One Piece so much. The characters and scenery is amazing. Most people who just start One Piece were not sure about the art including myself. But after a while you will get used to it. 
 
I myself love drawing One Piece characters. There is something appealing about the style it is hard to explain. It is just your taste who decides if you like it or not. 
 
[10] Sound: 
 
The soundtracks are amazing! The voice acting is supreme. So much emotion behind the voices. When the characters are sad you can feel and hear it trough there voices. 
 
The openings are really good too. My favourites are Opening 1 We are, Opening 13 One day, Opening 15 We Go, Opening 19 We can. This does not mean I do not have the other openings in my playlist because they are amazing as well and give you this adventerous and happy feeling. 
 
About the background soundtracks and characters themes, well they are amazing espacially Luffy's theme. It starts as a happy tune but it ends really dark. This says a lot about Luffy's personality. The other crewmembers have amazing theme songs as well. The background soundtracks are amazing aswell, the background music makes it more emotional or more exciting.  
 
[9] Character: 
 
Characters well I would give it a 10 if there were'nt so much annoying chacters. Not only enemies but some friends of the straw hats are just irritating. But, this does not change the fact that 90% of the characters are amazing and interesting and unique in there own way. 
 
So much characters are introduced in the story and Oda can still think of more intersting Characters with different abilities and personalities. Amazing! 
 
Well, the character development is amazing! I have never seen better character development in another anime than One Piece. I will explain later on why. 
 
As you can tell by my profile picture is Monkey D. Luffy Aka. Mugiwara no Luffy my favourite character. But besides Luffy I have got atleast 20 characters I love. 
As I said earlier the backstory's of the straw hats are really interesting and emotional. Not ony the backstory's of the straw hats but there are a lot of characters with amazing backstory's. 
 
The amazing thing about One Piece is Luffy recruiting new members for the Straw Hat pirates. It is really amazing and you are curious about who joins next. Again, this is something you need to experience yourself and I can not really tell much about this without spoiling anything. 
 
I really want to write more detailed about the main characters. But I do not want to ruin the story for you a spoil stuff about the characters. The reason for not writing any name besides Luffy's is because I want to keep it a secret for the people who do not know who will join the Straw Hats in the future.  
 
Even though you probably seen it on covers or images or on My Anime List under the secton ''Characters''. 
 
[10] Enjoyment: 
 
If you read my review you would have probably seen that I love One Piece and that I enjoyed every bit of it. I actually binged the serie and movies in a really short time.  
 
I love the myserie, the happy moments, the sad moments, the exciting moments and everything besides that. This anime brought me so much tears to my eyes. Not only because of laughter but because of sadness and excitement aswell. 
 
[10] Overall: 
 
There is not really much more to say. I hope I convinced you to try watching One Piece for yourself. I have seen a lot of Shonen anime as you can see on my profile, but One Piece remains number one for me. I think I am going to end this review here. 
_________________________________________________________________ 
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this, I really did my best to avoid spoilers. One Piece is an anime that is hard to explain and you really need to experience it for yourself as I said earlier.  
 
I am sorry if I made some mistakes in grammer and spelling. English is not my first language but I am trying my best.

    SPOILER ALERT 
This is my first review, but let me say this first. This is my personal favorite anime of all times and I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a fun time filled with adventures, action, fantasy and comedy! 
 
Story: 10/10. The story is about Monkey D. Luffy who sets of into the pirat world to look for the one piece. The one piece is a treasure that contains everything that Gold D. Roger (a.k.a. The First And Only Pirat King) left behind after his death. To start of Luffy begins to gather people in his pirat crew: Straw Hat Pirates to set of in the Grand Line where adventures and challenges awaites them at every turn. His goal is to get nakamas in his crew and become the Pirat King.  
 
Art: 9/10. Although the art may not seem good at first, it really fits the story and characters to the show. Remember that this anime started in 1999 and ofcourse the art changes over time and becomes different. Weather you like it or not. Peronaly I think the art is just fine and they should change it the way they want it to. Because I belive the producers know what is best for the show, as we have seen in all the episode so far. (damn good and I can't complain).  
 
Sound: 10/10. The sound in this Anime has to be one of the best things about the series. Every sound fits perfectly and you really can't seem to find any bad fits for it. The music is also great where they have over 60 songs. The voice actors for the characters fits amazingly and I feel like that is how the character would sound in the real world. The sounds is definitely one of the things that does this anime to the best one so far. 
 
Characters: 9/10. The main thing about the characters is that it is really important to separate characters the second you lay eyes on them. Therefore I think the special designs on some of the characters is good and should be like that. For example Usopp with his long nose. Each character has their own uniqe element to their characters so that we can both see their personality and their characters. The main thing about the way one piece does this story is that the focuse on each individual which takes a huge amount of episodes and time. Which is not a bad thing btw. We can really feel the characters and get to know them. One example of this was when they were getting rid of the Going Merry, Usopp was devastated. We knew that because the boat was a gift from Kaya and Usopp had a special relationship with the Going Merry. All in all, love the characters.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10. This anime is perfect to watch if you just want to relax and have a good time watching Luffy beat up everyone. There is not much to say other than when you start watching the show, you can't stop untill you have watched every episode and movie of the series. I think I completed all 800+ episodes in under a month where I could not do anything else than watch this amazing anime. 
 
Overall: 10/10. This anime is my favorite anime and I can't wait for each new episode that comes out. And I want the anime to continue well past 1000 episodes so that I can watch it long into the future. I recommend this so much to everyone who loves a good adventure, action and fantasy anime with some good laugh in the as well.

    A MASTERPIECE.  
 
The plot, the characters, the action scenes, the concept, even the fillers are nice!!! I love how vast its world is and almost all types of people, powers and places are here! It  
 
It will never fail to make you laugh and cry. Unlike other Shonen animes that solves the problem by mere willpower and guts, this one's different. Lots of unexpected twists and revelations. It doesn't focus only on a one character instead its the whole crew of the Straw Hat Pirates. Every one of them gets to grab the spotlight but of course Luffy is still the has the max airtime. 
 
I guess its only flaw is that it is a BIT long but despite the number of its episodes it is definitely worth watching. I will see this anime til the end no matter how long it takes. Kudos to Oda!

    ""What? You still haven't seen One Piece?"" 
 
That's the response I always get when meeting fellow anime fans once they ask me about One Piece. And then after that, they'd proceed and tell me reasons why I should watch it now.  
 
I know that it's good. I heard a lot of positive reviews about it after all. But what discouraged me from picking it up (which I'm sure might also the reason those who still haven't seen One Piece have no plans to do so) is the number of episodes. It's A LOT and unless you're really dedicated and patient, that won't sit well with you.  
 
Well, guess what? The reason why I didn't want to watch it in the first place became the main reason why I love it. I'm so glad I didn't let it discourage me from trying it out! 
 
And so, after three months and one week of marathoning this anime, I finally caught up with the latest episode when this review was written which was episode 831. Wow, what a ride. One Piece has everything I love about anime--enthralling world, captivating plot, mind-blowing twists, fascinating and relatable characters, heart-stopping actions, heartbreaking deaths, and more. That's why in no time, One Piece became one of my most favorite anime of all time. 
 
Thanks to the huge number of episodes, you can really get attached to the SH crew and other notable characters to the point where you can't imagine life without them. From the first episode, I immediately knew my life was about to change now that I discovered this treasure. 
 
The world it offers is really beautiful. The parallels that are compared to real life are just simply brilliant.  
 
Don't even get me started with the plot. This plus the plot twists are strengths of One Piece. Every arc will surely get you hooked and after watching an episode, it'll make you want for more.  
 
Great characters too. The backstories are relatable and you can really sympathize with them. You'll get attached to them that's why the deaths are really heartbreaking. There was a character's death where it took me three weeks before I had the strength to continue watching the series! That's how in love I am with this anime and not everyone can do that so good job Oda! 
 
The actions are great too. There are times when I felt like my heart would stop in suspense. I just wish they'd shorten it though. There were a lot of times where I skipped some scenes because it felt like the animators were just dragging it (which is probably the real case).  
 
As for the soundtracks, well it's good but most of the opening and ending songs are forgettable for me. It's not enough to catch my attention and convince me not to skip it. However, there are notable opening songs as well that I didn't skip at all.  
 
Overall, One Piece is one of the best anime of all time for me. It deserves all the success and praise it receives! A true classic, indeed. So don't hesitate and just jump right in! You're in for a ride of a lifetime. ;)

    Personally I have tried 4 times to get into this series (reading and watching). Each time something different has been a turn off for me but I know there are a lot of people on the other side of the fence. So I guess give it a try. My big 3 reasons for not liking this series 
 
1.) I am not gonna rag on it to much but like some of the other comments mention the art style is not for everyone, I can't deal with it for very long myself. 
 
2.) The characters. This is somewhat of a nitpick and I have heard now since they are on episode like 800+ and some crazy amount of manga chapters some of this has been remedied but outside of Luffy,Zoro,Nami, and Sanji the other characters for the main cast are flat out annoying.  
 
3.) The length. I understand that for some people this doesn't bother them cause they have been reading since day 1. I don't have 3 lifetimes to spend trying to get caught up with this. If you are someone who has limited time due to life this is not for you if you want to have any idea what is currently going on. While I am not trying to give much away but with all the strange adventures that this series covers I was informed after so many episodes they made it to the grand line where they were trying to go for so long just to sail right back away from it? At this point can't tell if they are just trying to drag it out for every penny its worth or if there is story they couldn't continue in a spin off.

INTRO: 
 
I started One Piece because I noticed it was placed pretty high on the TOP anime list here (#38 at the time). And I was just thinking ""WHY? Looks shitty"". Anyway I felt like trying out another long running series at the time cause I was starting to get real bored with the other big shounens, and perhaps the genre itself. ""WTH I'll give it a go"". 
 
6 years later. I don't regret. ONE PIECE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE!!! 
 
It does not fall short compared to other battle shounens. I guarantee you. Looks kiddy in regards to the art, and the silliness it dishes out often, but it's no way a show just for kids like pokemon or Yu-gi-oh. Aight?  
 
 
STORY: 
 
Our main cast are pirates! They're actually the supposed bad guys here. They are not do-gooders. They just do whatever the hell they want, and sometimes that includes helping people, and kicking the other evil guys' butt. Their enemies and conflicts will arise from other pirates, the marines, and the world Government.  
 
The core element is adventure. It's adventure-plot driven. It's starts off with them island hopping, getting entangled in new stories, cultures, kicking the bad guy's ass, but the island hopping isn't all that random. They pertain to the main overarching plot, and to get to the final destination, well they gotta go to some places. In each arc, you'll obtain some piece of information that is relevant to the main story. The further you go in, you'll notice it becomes more and more connected to the overall arching plot.  
 
I wanna talk a little bit about the world of One Piece. In terms of world building, OP does more of it and better than most. ODA gave himself lots of leg room to work with yo. OP has this 'don't take me too seriously vibe' which helps us not to criticize it too much for some of the weirder things, yet it still manages to make it quite believable. A few minor things might not make sense, but overall it works. 
 
The plot is more complex than what it appears. The plot will grow, conflicts will arise, so many many awesome people you will meet, and even see again. Oda does a great job at seeding things in early on and tying them together later. And there are still many intriguing mysteries that are still yet to be solved even after 700 episodes. The world of One Piece is big, but the best thing is that it all feels connected.  
 
 
 
ART:  
 
Old, weird, fugly art at the beginning. Overtime style evolves a bit, and looks a lot better. I've come to personally love the style, especially the manga art. Gotta let it grow on you. Animation is acceptable-ish overall, later on before time skip it seems to get pretty good! Then after time skip it kinda goes to shit again. 
 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
This is the place where OP shines.  
 
THE CHARACTERS MAN. MANY ARE UNIQUE (some more than others), WEIRD, QUIRKY, BADASS, AND JUST PLAIN AWESOME. The characters are really something. I end up liking a lot of them, even ones where I initially thought wouldn't amount to anything worthy of attention. Oda gives his little imaginary people, character that you just can't help but end up liking despite how utterly bizarre they look sometimes. And in this grand OP world, you are going to be running into many different people. The OP cast is huge, some are one-dimensional, but many leave an impression on you.  
 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
PROS: Before I knew it, I end up loving the characters and their interactions with one another. Strong feels. I laugh, shed some manly tears, can really feel the anger of the characters. This show makes me feel lots during their adventures, but mostly this show puts a smile on my face. Good mix of comedy and serious business. Some of my favorite moments are just when the crew's hanging out on their ship, relaxing. Not a lot of fillers compared to other shounens either, and even when there are fillers, it's short, there for comedy sake, and fun to watch. I think the story & writing is really good, not cliche, and keeps me hooked. Unpredictable often, and I'm just sitting back and enjoying the ride.  
 
CONS: Might be a rough start for some, slow-paced as fuck at times/drawn out scenes in order to not catch up to the manga, seldom boring ass fodder villains (mostly during the start), excessive booby fan-service recently, can get repetitive, post time skip is starting to feel like your typical boring shounen. There are so many episodes, so of course there will be some boring ones. 
 
 
OVERALL:  
 
After all that praising, there will still be people who won't like it at all. It's because we're all fucking different and value different things.  
 
There are those who ONLY like watching mature, seinen, deep, intellectual, realistic animes who will find One Piece childish, and just not their thing.  
Then there are those who are more flexible and can enjoy the above listed and all kinds of other animes, and can appreciate humor, etc etc, AND WOULD STILL assume One Piece to be a trashy children's show just based on first impressions. 
 
I'm here to help the latter group of people, (who are able to enjoy a wide variety of anime like cowboy bebop, FMA, DBZ, Naruto, etc all at the same time) to understand that One Piece isn't as childish/retarded as they might initially think, and that they might enjoy it. 
 
It's not a kiddy or lame as Pokemon, Yugioh (no hate for these guys btw). One piece has comedy, but also has a serious story, and based on the numbers/facts, many do indeed, find it interesting. So give it a chance if you are on the fence about it. DROP IT if you absolutely HATE the first 150 episodes, BUT STILL BE AWARE that the story does get better and deeper the further you go in. (Isn't it like that for all big shounens?) 
 
It's not perfect. Why is it so popular then? Because it's just so damn enjoyable to watch despite some of its' flaws. For whatever reason, it clicked in the right way for a lot of us, and we just can't get enough of it. To be able to enjoy and be entertained. Isn't that all we want from a show? 
 
Another thing. I don't know about you guys, but OP feels more badass and less corny(?) to me than most of the other battle shounens. Can't explain it too well. 
 
 
TL;DR // RECOMMENDED FOR: 
 
So finally, if you love shounen such as DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, bleach, Gintama, HxH, and/or Hitman Reborn, and haven't tried One Piece, please do come see what the fuss is about. There's a good chance you might enjoy One Piece too. OP is sometimes sillier than some of these other titles and some people really don't have tolerance for that, and would prefer darker vibes like HxH, BUT if you're FLEXIBLE (you like all kinds of anime), give it a chance. TRUST ME, OP DOES NOT FALL SHORT IN TERMS OF STORY & SERIOUSNESS. Please, don't judge a book by its' cover. It is my favorite of the long battle shounens, and the only one of its' kind to have kept me interested this long. This is coming from someone who isn't a big fan of long battle shounens in the first place. 
 
If I were to grade the anime a little more fairly, I would give it a 7 or 8 because sometimes the animation quality drops, and also sometimes Toei adds useless scenes, or drags out certain boring scenes, and there are those boring episodes with boring badguys once in awhile. And also some little plot flaws like how a character never dies, etc. But if I were to grade it based on how much I fucking enjoy One Piece, it's story and characters overall, I give it a 10. 
 
So overall, anime One Piece gets 9/10 from me. 
 
 
 
Advice:  
 
For the love of God, don't go skipping around arcs. You're not gonna get that build up feel, and connection to the characters, which is important here. If you're gonna dedicate yourself to understanding OP, if you wanna understand why the fans love OP, it's best to watch all the arcs, (minus foxy arc unless you don't mind more comedy). Or better yet, just read the damn manga instead. The manga is perfect, the anime can sometimes be a little horrendous with the dragging and the unnecessary scenes.  And again, if you find the first 100 or so episodes TERRIBLY unbearable, it probably isn't your thing.

    After considering other anime as my favorite I've decided one thing ""one piece"". 
Unlike other animes, you can just watch one piece and it won't stop! 
A big pro about this anime is it's length.  
As long as you have the time, you can watch a lot of it without worrying that it'll end soon. 
Another great thing is the storyline. There isn't one big storyline like other animes,  this comes with arcs, an island with it's History and story, with the little storyline of what happends in the world of one piece. 
I've said to myself ""Okay I'm gonna watch this island again for sure!"" But after seeing the next one which is better ""No way! This is even better!"" And this is how it goes. 
The soundtrack- an awesome one, many themes for many situations. 
One piece started about 15 years ago, when the art was pretty ""bad"" but as the episodes pass the art is getting better. 
For those who watched Naruto and those with fillers, One Piece doesn't have many fillers and most of it are flashbacks. 
 
Movies! I've seen some of the sidestory movies which were good as well, like the real One Piece. 
 
Then, ""One Piece"" is THE anime of all times and can be considered a masterpiece.

    PLEASE READ FIRST: I have not yet caught up on One Piece so my review is only for the first 141 episodes. Think of it as a first impression if you want. I'll rewrite my review every 150 episodes or so. Please don't get anal on me if you don't agree with this review, like i said, it's only for the first 141 episodes. I have not written many reviews so constructive criticism is always more than welcome.   
 
Lemme just start off by saying if you have not yet started watching One Piece because you're intimidated by its size i would highly recommend starting it just to get a feel for it. It has definitely earned it's right to popularity. Plus you can always take it slow, there's no need to rush an anime if you don't have the time or ability to rush it. As for me i'm taking it pretty slowly, it took me three weeks to get to episode 141 and i've been taking a break from it for the past month but i will start watching again soon.  
 
Story 8/10 
One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy who is a some what dumb witty pirate on a quest to find the greatest treasure in the world, the One Piece, and become the Pirate King. You get to watch how Luffy gathers his own crew (nakama), gets his own ship and fight for nakama power. That pretty much sums up the amount of story i've seen so far. I gave the story an 8/10 because i did feel that it was very good and it gives the anime huge possibilities. Especially since this is a long time running shounen, the amount of arcs and character development they can do is almost endless. Thankfully there actually has been a decent amount of character development. I really can't wait to catch up to the series and honestly i've always loved pirates as a kid so when i heard there was an anime about pirates that was over 600 episodes i was like ""oh hell yea!!""  Only reason i took a break was because the pacing of the anime was just too god damn slow. Like the fight between luffy and Mr. 3 in the alabasta pre arc... omg no. too slow so no thx you. This is my main problem i have for the story, Oda Eiichiro is a genius but his pacing can be almost unbearable at times. My second problem is all the arcs so far have been extremely predictable. It basically goes like this; Luffy and his crew would go fight the bad guy and the bad guy's crew, they would beat up all the unimportant grunts of the crew and then there would be a few enemies that were actual threats and they would have to fight  with Luffy's crew. Then when it was time to fight the main bad guy, everyone would wait for Luffy to come and kick his ass. That pretty much explains every arc so far. :/ 
 
Art and Sound 8/8 
The art was pretty good for being as old as it was, i can't really complain to much because as One Piece progresses you'll begin to notice the art also progresses with the series. Nothing too impressive yet but i'm sure as i catch up i'll start to see the higher quality of the art and animation. The sound was pretty good, not too many memorable songs so far but there are one or two in there. That does not mean they don't have good songs! One Piece has songs that fit the situations they're placed in but unlike Fairy Tail or Magi the sound track doesn't really stick to me.  
 
Character 10/10 
Yes, 10/10 for the characters, Luffy is hilarious, he's honest and even though he's some what dumb, he has a true love for his nakama. Most people don't like nakama power in anime but i for one love nakama power, if it's a shounen and it doesn't have nakama power than it just doesn't feel right when i watch it. Obviously that's just my opinion, i know a lot of people hate nakama power with the passion but as a kid till now i've always believed in the powers of nakama. I like Zoro's character too because he's a total bad ass. He has three swords and he tears up every body with them. Nami is cool because even though sh'es useless in a fight, she's useful in like everything else from navigating to operating the ship. Usopp can go to hell. Chopper is amazing and i actually haven't got to the character development for nico robin yet so i really don't know too much about her so i can't say anything about her yet. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10 
I really really enjoyed this anime. It's funny and has a good feel to it when i watch it. It has a lot of nakama power and a good amount of action in it. The situations The Straw Hat Pirates find themselves in are hilarious. If only it wasn't for the pacing of this anime i would have rated it a 10 for my enjoyment. Cause honestly i can tolerate the predictability of the anime but slow pacing is a no go! Especially for longer series.  
 
Overall 8/10 
This is an anime that should definitely be watched by everyone. For the most part it's very good, the story is very original, and like i said before Oda is a genius. One Piece has a snowballing effect  so the more you go the more it builds up and it will eventually turn to this giant masterpiece of snow and amazement.. that is very predictable with terrible pacing haha. No seriously though, i'm glad i started it.

    When it comes to One Piece, there are two kinds of people. The first ones, obviously, are the people who hate the guts of this anime. Second ones are who love it to the core. There's virtually nothing in between. 
Let me tell you. For the ones who watch the first few episodes and go on telling stories like ""Oh it's not even worth it. I watched 5 episodes and I'm done"". You missed out on an amazing journey. It's like the saying ""Never judge a book by its cover"" (Even when the book has 800+ chapters!). The first few episodes can only be expressed as part of the cover. Shit gets real once you get a hang of the later episodes, like during Arlong Park Arc. After that, you're put on an amazing journey, with lots of enjoyment, character development, feels and much more. And if you ask me, One Piece actually has one  of the best character development plots I've seen. I do admit though, scrolling through some other reviews, I saw the criticism on how almost all characters never really die, no matter how hard they get hit. I do agree with that. But at the same time, this element isn't of too much importance if you ask me ._. 
So for those of you who give One Piece a bad review at first sight, I advice you. Give it a try, and you'll love it. You heard it from me.

    Soooo um this is my first review and just to get this out of the way I don't hate One Piece it just wasn't my cup of tea so I dropped it I might go back to it though and if I do I'll review it again 
 
I watched this anime Dubbed (The   
 FUNimation Dub not the 4Kids one by the way) 
 
Story - 7 
Ok the story is that the character Luffy wants to find a legendary treasure known as the ""One Piece"" and become the Pirate King only theirs one problem he doesn't have a ship or a crew or any idea what he's doing ok so maybe theirs a few problems 
I see know problem with this story only it takes a long while to get going which makes sense when you hear from fans that it takes 30 episodes to get off the ground which in my opinion is not a good thing to me an anime should get 
you hooked on first epiosde or maybe the first few but not 30 thats just not right so One Piece does not have a bad story it just has a really REALLY slow (At the begenning at lesat) one which makes it kinda boring to me just saying 
 
Art - 8 
The art is good I guess I never care about the art or animation so lets move on 
 
Sound - 8 
I guess the sound is good I don't really get why I have to talk about sound so again lets move on 
 
Charater - 7 
Fainlly something to talk about so the charaters their good I like them I guess I'll talk about each of them well the ones I know about 
 
Luffy - He's this animes MAIN main protagonist of One Piece he's well he's werid but not in a bad way he's goofy and funny but can be really serious when mad 
he's a good charater in my book 
 
Zoro - He's cool and intersting I like the fact that he has 3 swords he's got a sad backstory that I won't spoil 
so yeah 
 
Nami - She's clever and funny and she also has a sad backstory which I can't spoil becase I don't know what it is 
 
Usopp - He's funny and a lair he's also is a cowrd but brave when tries he's backstory is sad too and again I won't spoil it 
 
I'd make one on Sanji but I know almost nothing about him so moveing on 
 
Enjoyment - 7 
I had a good time watching it but like I said with the story it was knida boring from what I watched 
still it made me laugh from time to time but it also made me sit a my screen for a few mintes doing nothing deosn't mean it didn't make happy or sad it did I promiose it was just like I said kinda boring 
 
Overall - 6 
To me One Piece has its ups and downs its ups being its humor the charaters and the fights its downs are that the beginning is slow and takes to many episodes to get off the ground 
Maybe your opinion will be diffrent when you watch it well if you watch it sorry if this review was lacking it is my first one after all I also didn't watch much of One Piece so I don't have much to go off of

    This is the first review I have ever written, or even plan to write, so give me a break. 
 
 To sum up ""One Piece"" in a single word, I would have to say AMAZING. Everything about it represents why I love watching anime. The fact that I am still watching it now after 550 episodes, and still wanting more is enough to show just how great it is. The only negative aspect about the show is also a good thing. There a simply a TON of episodes. In order to start one piece you need to be willing to dedicate days of time towards it. But if you love One Piece, like I do, then the fact that there are so many episodes is actually the best part about it! 
  
Im not the type of person to go in depth about things, so I will keep this brief. One Piece offers a simple, yet genius story. Has an amazing cast of characters. Has a variety of different elements, including comedy, action, adventures, tear-jerking scenes, and even a little romance. AND WHO DOESN""T LOVE PIRATES? COME ON! Combine all these things and then some, and you get my favorite anime of all time. For those of you who are willing to spend a lot of time on an anime, WATCH ONE PIECE! You wont regret it.

    Lets start with One Piece is a long show. it took me half a year to arrive to ep 600 and even then not the latest ep. ( I watch it during most weekend and holidays) You might feel discourage so if you do i suggest you watch a small spoiler. Since thats 1 of the other reason i did not drop the anime. 
 
When i first watch the first episode i showed no interest in this anime. Half way through the first ep i fell asleep . It took me another year or 2 before i start getting serious and began watching One Piece. 
 
The animation before the time slip or whatever it call was not into my liking. But after getting use to it i began to really love one piece. Luffy and his crew is a hilarious bunch that i love to hang out with. There will be a hot character appearing randomly and sometimes an ugly one . Occasionally the animation will show unnecessary and unwanted episode  disrupting the show. 
 
One piece however is a loyal anime. A character that appear during the first few episode might appear at episode 300+.  So i hope if you are planning to watch this you have to remember the sort of i-dont-think-i-see-this-character-again character. If not you might be lost. 
 
The fun part of One piece is when you reach 300+ episode. Thats where you could see the plot moving into a different direction. So wait until you reach that episode before thinking badly of the animation.  
 
Reaching the 400+ you might have already experience sadness and laughter is you did not then you are inhuman. (I cried continuously for episodes). Im sure around this chapter there will be a hangover. A random episode will appear at the crucial part. I would have skip it if i havent had that this-episode-might-not-be-important feeling. 
 
The skip year happened. (yesh) better animation. Better looks. tearful meeting. and LAW!! He is my sexy bitch. The appearance of LAW, Makes the animation more hilarious than it already is. Well this is as far as i already watch. 
 
WATCH IT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. IF YOU THINK ITS BORING . JUDGE IT AFTER WATCHING EP 300+. YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DONT, THERE ARE MANY TIMES I'LL FEEL LIKE SQUEEZING MY HEART. SO WATCH IT.

    This review can contain spolliers(I'll try my best to not to give any) and spelling mistakes(My native language isn't english). 
 
I've dropped this anime 3 times in its beginning, and today it's one of my favorites, so I decided to do this review so people can have patience and take advantage of this great work. 
 
 
 
Let's started with the story (10/10) - The story it's simple by the began, but having the novelty of the main character isn't but the traditional hero always, telling the story of an outlaw pirate(Luffy) and the pursuit of his dream of becoming the king of pirates. 
In this anime Luffy has a goal, different from many other anime, several times you will hear the main character scream '' I'm gonna become King Of the Pirates'' like Naruto scream ''I will become Hokage''. This is not something negative since with a goal already in mind the anime doesn't create much content that hasn't connection with the main objective, this making the anime more ''fast'', I just remember of 4 episodes fillers in +700. 
But of course nothing is perfect and certain episodes try to delay the story a lot, especially in the saga Dressrosa, in which there are many repeated scenes, such as scenes where people show often running in the same episode. 
This anime takes a while to get interesting, to get an idea I dropped it about 3 times at its beginning, where the fights can't get my attention and I was surprising very the different traits, mainly in the eyes of the characters. It took me until episode 70 to start really taking advantage of.  
But after that Eiichiro Oda manages to create a whole new world(literally, lol), with a very well made plot and organizations that have their secrets or their particular goals and all this can have connection with the main characters, becoming more and more an unforeseeable anime. 
 
Art (9/10)  - As I had said, the art and ''lines, dashes'' of the characters is very different from ordinary. At first I thought it was horrible, but I easily got used to it and many of the characters I consider to be one of the most creative and beautiful to see. 
But it really took me a while to get used to Usopp, being one of the most different characters in appearance. And to think that today he is considered ''God Usoop''... (not spolier, I swear). 
It is also good to say that throughout the anime the art improves a lot in all aspects, only I not liking the change in Robin. 
 
Sound (10/10) - Great music, especially in action scenes. My favorite is ''The very, very, very strongest''. I don't know much what to comment more here, so let's go to the next one. 
 
Character (10/10) - All characters are unique, both in design and in personality. Luffy looks a bit ''baka'' too much, but that makes it all very funny, and when he gets angry the only thing you think is: ''woohaaa Luffy will get him''. 
My favorite one is Zoro, he's the best... He's like Vegeta but even better... lol, but it's truth. 
This anime hasn't only 1 main, throughout the story more and more characters are highlighting and catching our attention, but of course that focuses more on Luffy...  
Also has a great prominence for main characters, several times you will get totally annoyed with them. Even villains who don't possess grandiose powers are able to make us angry with their very exentric personalities. 
There are so many great characters in this anime that if I were to quote everyone I would write for 3 days and I could tell spoliers unintentionally 
, so I'll just say that and go to the next one. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10) - You will enjoy every moment watching this anime, but it's important to have patience especially at the beginning of it, but it will be worth every second that you spend watching.  
Honestly I delayed to start this anime because of the large number of episodes that it has, but before long I watched so many episodes that I easily reached the current episodes and still hoping that this incredible anime takes a long time to finish. 
 
Overall (10/10) - This anime is incredible, is it Master Piece in all aspects, mainly in story... So the only thing I say to you that has read all this review is: please be patient with the beginning of the anime that in the end you will be inspired by this great work of Eiichiro Oda.

    Great anime to watch if you have nothing to do. Sure it's long and it's still ongoing, but don't be hesitated to watch. The story is great, everything is great. The only problem is time. I caught up with the anime in 2 years and I'm waiting for new episodes to come out. In terms of action, it is also good like Naruto.  
 
After you have finished the Skypea arc, trust me, the real story will begin. It will lead them to a new threat, THE WORLD! It will have our heroes a hard time in overcoming this threat until today.  
 
Read the manga if you caught up to the episodes. The author is a genius for giving us this anime and manga.

    This review will be undeniably biased! ""I believe that no matter how old we grow and mature we get, we will always have that child inside us"" and ONE PIECE is the that woke mine.  Of course, just like other anime, this one is probably not for everyone as we have our own different taste of genre. This anime requires time and commitment to be able to understand the whole story. 
 
First with the brilliant Author, I myself is a huge fan of Fairy Tail (Mashima Hiro)  and Naruto (Kishimoto Masashi) they are my top three! but I still believe that Eiichiro Oda is the best among all of them because until now I can't still figure out how he does such amazing plot twist throughout the story and the fact that the ENDING has already been laid out and so much has already happened yet the ending remains unchanging is just too brilliant.  
 
Second, Toei production! This anime has been following the manga and there has to be a gap between the latest chapter and episode. Therefore, the time comes when one anime has to make a filler but when one piece has to make one they are still able to connect it with the flow of the series and that's what makes them amazing. The first episode has an old animation since technology has not been developed at that time but now they create this amazing design and animation.  
 
Thrid, Characters 9 members! namely, LUFFY, ZORO, NAMI, USOPP, SANJI, CHOPPER, ROBIN, FRANKY, and BROOK! these nine characters are the one that brings joy in the series the bond and loyalty of these people are truly remarkable. All of them have gone through painful childhood and LUFFY the captain of the crew has made a huge impact in their life and made them capable of changing to reach their individual dreams. Luffy's faith to the crew is one of the most amazing things for me, ""betrayal"" may come but he himself  (instinct basically) knows that there is a reason why one member can act that way and of course he is right. Every saga introduced a new character and all of them comes with a sad story which touches the viewer's life and can truly bring you learnings! 
 
 
Fourth, STORY! as I said ODA truthfully is one brilliant mangaka/author. The whole series is full of plot twists and emotions. as I mentioned every saga and arc introduce a new character and all of them comes with a shocking plot twist. There will be times when something is mentioned in the beginning of the episode but we will only get the explanation in the middle of the story.  
OVERALL THERE'S SO MUCH PLOT TWISTS AND EXPLANATION ODA NEEDS TO LAY OUT TO HIS READERS! SO MUCH ENJOYMENT, EXCITEMENT, AND THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO! A NEVER BORING ANIME! 
 
This anime is a roller coaster and of course, this is beyond 10 for me in comes of ratings! I recommend this manga/anime to people who can truly commit and can give time since it has currently 867 chapters and 791 episodes (I am following both manga and anime)!

    ""The beautiful depth of the story itself compensates for the drag of this anime..."" 
 
okay Im not going to write a review on every little aspect and detail. Rather I do want to highlight the negative side of this anime because there is only few that bugs me. If dealt with then I believe it could be the most amazing anime of all time.  
 
My biggest pet peeves with this anime are mainly two things.  
1) the DRAG. Seriously the last anime that I thought was a drag was Dragonball Z. Seriously One Piece takes 1/4 of your entire episode on the starting theme song and the ""previously on One Piece"". THus I always fast forward to the 4-5mn mark to start watching. Also they spend another good 1/4 of the anime on slow walking characters, slow reactions, to slow opening doors, to replayed movements. Its hilariously dragged out.  
HOWEVER i get it! they are pumping out episodes non stop since 1999 on top of movie specials, and special eps. I get it, its probably how the people in the studio cope with it. But still, it drives me insane. THats why I always binge watch One Piece. Once a year during Christmas holidays I watch around 50 episodes. BUT F*CK ME! even with a year worth of episodes its only like 1 week into the actual story line.  
 
2) Another pet peeve is the character of Luffy. YEs you heard me, the main character, the indestructible, loved by all, Monkey f*cking D Luffy. Dont get me wrong, do i like the character? absolutely. But he pisses me off because of his character and personality. YEs at first i enjoyed his irrational, free spirited, careless fearless personality, but that goes into some extent. With every crisis that arrises because of Luffys immaturity alot of ppl suffer. But ofcourse its an anime so it all works out in the end, so i dont mind it. However what I do mind is the fact that he just doesnt grow up nor learn from his mistakes. Hes the same luffy from ep 1. Sure he learnt new skills, and broaden his boundaries. But his major maturity level, of dealing with situation hasnt changed. If he knows his rash decisions or irrational behaviours have caused many people to stumble then like any other human being he should be able to learn from it. Thus I find him selfish in that sense. But the irony is he is portrayed as the most selfless character who is willing to die for his friends, which is the cause of his vast popularity. But my major argument is simply, hes selfish in the sense of not having the self control in his lack of maturity. like any other decent human they should be able to grow and mature. But I think he hasnt. But I understand without this side of him the anime wouldnt be as adventurist as it is, which we all known to love.   
 
Overall its still an amazing anime, but this is just my honest opinion.

    Ok guys I'm gonna make this short, One Piece is the best that's it! I watch it for the Epicness and badassery unlike most anime and manga One Piece relates to the outer world as you have an evil World Government trying to tarnish and control people's ideals and actions with discrimination and brutality, so relate this to the outer world and what do you get? 
 
Another reason are the AWESOME characters like Shanks, Monkey D Dragon, Sabo, Akainu, Kizaru, Aokiji, Ace, Whitebeard, Dracule Mihawk, Kaidou, Big Mom etc. All which have their own unique personalities and ones we haven't seen yet  
( Don't get close to Shanks, he's got Conqueriors Haki and you might die from epicness! ). To be honest I watch it for the fights and the characters so...... yeah... and once people who want to get into One Piece but when they see the number of episodes find it impossible so I tell them its worth the effort!. Get into it, One Piece By far has one of the best STORYLINES IN ALL OF ANIME!.  
 
Hope you find this review helpful, Have a good day

    You can't Really fully Appreciate one piece without a decent Brain and Vast General knowledge.  
 
Kids will like the adventures, ""chase your dream"" motto, friends and all the action. 
 
But it takes a Teen and older to Truly Pick up on the Deeper Plot meanings and underlying point in the storyline.  
 
One piece touches on modern day problems such as racism, corruption, abuse of power, information manipulation, history cover-up, Slavery, Drug addiction and terrorists. 
 
Racism: Evident with the Fishmen and human relationship where humans which regard Fishmen as nothing more than Beasts capture and sold Fishmen off as slaves causing Hatred among fishmen towards humans. 
 
Corruption, where some Navy soliders deal with the black market and sells items off to criminals and pirates. 
 
Abuse of Power, Certain Navy personal can destroy islands if they feel like it without any valid reasons, Tenryubito can summon Admirals when they feel like it and capture/kill/maim anyone they deem fit. 
 
information manipulation: When the Navy covered up crocodile's Defeat to SHs by crediting it to smoker and of course the hidden secret of Ace's bloodline, Garp's Bloodline, Robin's Past and of course the burning of books regarding the poneglyphs. 
 
history cover-up: of course the banning of anyone learning to read poneglyphs, burning of books regarding poneglyphs, destruction of any material regarding the blank century and of course hunting and killing anyone who knows anything and implementing the vague story of how kings of many countries came together and created the World government. 
 
Slavery:  Tenryubitos or any other people in the one piece world can buy slaves, the world government has been using slaves to build a useless world bridge to link the world in tortuous conditions without any regard to the human rights and tenryubitos torture and ""play"" with their slaves. 
 
Drug Addiction: Fishmen Island ARC Had hordy jones and his new fishmen pirates eating tons of steroids and many people can argue that chopper does steroids too but chopper is a doctor he knows what he's doing. And seeing how this is a review for the Anime I shall not include anything from the manga. but trust me drug addiction is a thing in one piece Sheshesheshesh   
 
Terrorists: Actually it really depends on what you define is a terrorist, if you define a terrorist as someone/some group which attacks a country not representing any other country then every pirate that attacks any island is a terrorist but what if the country being attacked is a bad country does that make the terrorist a good guy/group?  
 
And that's why even though one piece is so long, it remains interesting, it makes you think about issues that are very relevant to the real world. 
 
of course one Piece also has a interesting world with weird weather, cool technology (COLA = OIL), and Super Natural Stuff such as HAKI, DEVIL Fruits, weird places such as: only every freaking island! 
 
And of course great fight scenes with cool DF powers and awesome soundtracks.

    One Piece is an anime frequently classified with Bleach and Naruto as one of the ""Big 3"" in anime and manga. These 3 have ruled at the top in terms of popularity for over a decade, and their popularity is still high as ever, if not higher. I personally find it really hard to get into long-running animes (+100) but surprisingly, One Piece was an exception, a rare one at that.  
 
One Piece was one of my first anime I've watched. (first being pokemon ofc) It was the anime that got me into anime, especially when there was a time where I thought anime was boring and a waste of time. I literally thought that they didn't have anything special about it. However, after getting a recommendation from my brother, One Piece really changed my views on anime. Since I barely knew about anime at that time, I was really intrigued by the aspect of pirates and adventure. I watched one episode, then another, and another... and I was hooked to the show in no time at all. Because I was impressed by One Piece, I started watching other shows, mostly of the similar genre. From then, my love for anime has grew and grew, and is still growing to this day and it's all thanks to one great piece of anime. 
 
One Piece takes place during the Great Age of Pirates, which started when the King of Pirates, Gol D. Roger announced to the world shortly before his death that he had hidden his greatest treasure, the ""One Piece"" somewhere, and told others to find it. About 20 years later, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy, who ate the Gomu Gomu no mi devil fruit, also interested in finding the One Piece and exploring the world, sets out on a journey full of exciting adventures, dangerous pirates and marines, and meeting new friends. From there, he makes many new comrades to support his journey. 
 
The story itself seems nothing special, but it evolves as the time goes on. At the time of writing this review, One Piece is at 670 episodes, which might tell you that it is rather drawn out. However, during those 670 episodes, they slowly build the world and characters into something unique and huge, enhancing the story bit by bit. The story arcs are fantastic and well thought out, sometimes leaving you in awe. In the story arcs, you are usually introduced to other minor characters, some who are equally interesting to watch just as the main characters. And the fights as a whole, are really well paced and entertaining, mixing blends of action, humor, and drama to keep you hooked. 
Also, like most other long running anime, One Piece does have its share of fillers. BUT, they have nowhere near an overwhelming amount of fillers and some fillers can even be enjoyable as well. The fillers also introduce you to new characters, who although non-canon, are still pretty likable as well.  
 
Like many other animes, One Piece also has a system of supernatural powers. In the world of One Piece, there are things known as Devil Fruits, which essentially take the shape of real-life fruits, but taste horrible and give consumers a unique power. Depending on the user and how they use it, the Devil Fruit can become something very powerful. The concept of the Devil Fruit is one of the most impressive aspects of One Piece. There are three types of known Devil Fruit: Paramecia, which gives you the ability of superhuman ability or traits, Zoan which lets you transform into an animal, and finally Logia, which can transform your body into an element like fire or ice.  
 The idea of eating something and getting superpowers is nothing new, but the fact that One Piece has shown an immense amount of Devil Fruits already, and that no two fruits are ever the same, is quite impressive. Oda really exercised his creativity level on this part, as while some abilities might come off as goofy, you cannot deny the creativity and work Oda put into some of the fruits and their users. 
 
For the Art... now this is the section I've heard the MOST complaints about. To be honest, I was bit skeptical myself when I first saw the art style. It can come off as cartoonish, childish drawing for the most parts, possibly turning off viewers. However, as I watched on and on, I forgot about it. After a couple of episodes, I honestly didn't CARE for how the art looked, as I was just immensely enjoying the hell out of the show. It's really a hit or miss however, as it can turn many people off completely, while others might not be bothered by it so much. 
Also, nowadays, the art in One Piece has improved dramatically. It is much more pleasing to the eye than it ever was. The artwork is fresh and clean. The character designs are also outstanding as well. Some might be drawn rather silly, but the uniqueness in some of the character art is very fun to look at. 
 
Now, I've heard some people say that the soundtracks are rather silly and lame. This really depends on your tastes in music, but I personally found most of the soundtracks amazing. While some of them do come off as silly, the osts all fit the scene and atmosphere very well. The voice acting is also equally impressive, with each of the voice actors fitting their characters perfectly, and also being able to deliver emotion, or intensity depending on the scene. 
 
The characters in the Straw Hat Pirates are special. Not really because they will be the most unique characters you'll ever see, but because of the bond they share with each other. The characters are very well developed, have interesting/fun personalities, and most importantly, they are easy to love. They all have interesting backgrounds, some which are tragic, and are striving to achieve their dreams as they adventure together. As they travel along, they start to care for each other so deeply to the point where they would do anything to protect each other, creating extremely powerful and emotional episodes or arcs at some point. 
The Straw Hat crew members are exceptionally great, but the supporting characters themselves are no slouch either. Most of them are designed well and have unique, interesting personalities. Unlike many anime, they aren't just pushed to the side, no. Most of them have interesting, yet traguc backgrounds and goals,  and you can't help but cheer for them as they try to achieve their own goals. Some even are just as lovable as the main characters themselves! Hell, I even cheered for some of the antagonists at one point as well, as they were just too likable and unique.  
 
One Piece is an amazing anime. Although not perfect, it still is one of the most fun and entertaining experience I've ever had. I know many people who won't even give One Piece a chance for couple of reasons. Most are turned away by the art, some are discouraged because of the episode count, and some are even victims of the infamous 4kids dub (which was HORRIBLE btw). Well, I can't force people to watch it, but I really think everyone should give One Piece at least a chance. In one anime, you'll be taken through a journey full of adventure, good action, comedy, and drama. Who knows? You could enjoy the hell out of this show, and possibly forget about every downsides I mentioned above.  
 
I sure did, and maybe you could as well, if you just give it a try.

    As of writing this review, One Piece has just reached 700 episodes. 
 
After seeing every episode I feel like I can write a pretty accurate review of One Piece so far. It took me 1 year to catch up to the current episode. I started in April 2014 and caught up April-May 2015 and I have to say I am glad I took my time compared to most people. 
 
The story starts off relatively slow as they introduce the base characters of the crew but it picks up once they've all been established properly. For an anime like this it gets incredibly dark which is what most non-watchers would expect. 
 
The soundtrack is pure 10/10. 90% of the songs are orchestrated beautifully and match the scene perfectly. Not much else to say. 
 
The artwork/animation is top notch with only a few scenes being a bit rushed. People tend to use these scenes as ""Toei ruinin muh anime"" but it's fine. People should stop complaining about it. 
 
All the Straw Hats are fleshed out well and you know why they're in the crew and how they got there. Many feels to be had. 
 
People usually wonder about the dub of this anime. I have watched both subbed and dubbed of it and I have to say overall that subbed is better purely because the Luffy voice actress in Japanese nails it. All the other voices in the dub (apart from Robin) are equal to the sub version if not better. However the JP voice actress nailed the role perfectly and it can't be competed with. 
 
Overall I have to give it a 10. While it has a few bumpy arcs, the overall story is something you rarely get to experience. Take your time if you do watch it. I know people who powered through it in a month and regretted it. Once you catch up, don't forget to read the manga!

    Plot. 
The last words spoken by the Pirate King before his execution, have inspired many: «My treasure? Take them if you can! Now you know where I left them!». The legendary phrase Gold D. Roger marked the start the Great Age Pirates — thousands of people in the pursuit of their dreams went to the Grand Line, the most dangerous place in the world, wanting to become owners of a mythical treasure... 
But every year the romantics became less their gradually squeezed pragmatic pirates-robbers who loot was much closer than some «worthless dreams». But then, one fine day, a seventeen year old Luffy cherished dream has executed childhood — went to sea. His goal — neither more nor less than become the new Pirate King. Over the short enough term the young captain manages to put together a team consisting of not less ambitious adventure seekers. 
And let by them driven by completely different aspirations, most importantly, these guys are not as important money and fame, how much much more valuable — the principles and loyalty to friends. And yet — the service of a dream. 
Well, while on the Grand Line swim such people, the Great Age Pirates will always be with us! 
 
Brief introduction. 
The story itself, though quite simple at first glance, but it quickly evolved into something huge. Most of the very first episode focuses on team building and meet new characters. Although this is certainly not enough more action. But as soon as they catch up with the Grand Line, adventure go for adventure, and you can see a lot of fantastic-story arcs. Battles and fights well developed; fight the final boss is always completely full of epic. The episodes are full of lots of funny moments, not too much and not too little. There's always a delicate balance of action and humor. 
 
Design. 
At the expense of design. It is true, it is completely different from all the anime I've seen. But even so, you'll love it. Style change over time... still would! After a few years will pass and «One Piece» we will see in «new light». Cinematography (4:3) change in the anamorphic image (16:9). As a result, there will be more clear, bright, clean and colorful image. 
But despite these changes, the schedule 1999 has not lost its uniqueness and I love her still. )) 
 
Review. 
Some few years ago, «One Piece» promptly rushed into my life by becoming an integral part of it, decorate her own, unprecedented up to this point, paints. This anime was the ray of light, which I did not have all the time... a ray that shines to this day and will shine for me a very long time, if not forever. In fact, «One Piece» became my way of life, without exaggeration. In it there are so thin «highlight» that if the catches, then so thoroughly and deeply that permeates through the soul, and forget it ever anime, but rather that track that has left more than 350+ episodes of view, which looked at one go in record time, it is impossible. Of course, this is purely my personal opinion and experience. 
«One Piece» — is a constant drive that runs through you from head to toe. It's so crazy adventure, colorful characters, and a great atmosphere, I believe that «One Piece» One of the few things that can be considered perfect. At the moment, more than 678 episodes drawn, and it's not a terrible figure to show, on the contrary, each episode is so interesting and fascinating that when viewing exactly half of the episodes, you begin to frighten the thought that there is still the same, and in fact looks at one go and episodes of flying is not noticeable. 
«One Piece» — is one big pirate adventure story, with the supervision of that, you become a witness, unimaginable adventure through the red tape that goes the theme of dreams. This is another huge plus for the whole idea of ​​«One Piece», for this many thanks Ode Eiichiro. Dream - it's an incentive to go forward, to make progress, as well as live. This motif is thoroughly imbued with the entire anime series and its protagonists, who are each his dream, but they are making it all together. 
To sum up the above logic, although I believe that I could write at length on several pages of this wonderful anime, the conclusion suggests itself: «One Piece» — a bright pearl among all the anime genre shounen and adventure anime-series. He remains in my heart for ever, and do not forget while watching another anime. Those who did not look — look, those who viewed themselves soon want to reconsider. Of course this is again my personal opinion, but, hell, «One Piece» — a masterpiece! 
 
Soundtrack. 
I want to give due attention to the soundtrack. He is a great! Not only OST's but OP&ED. 
 
General impressions. 
Best Anime and best Shounen who saw and probably ever will see. Anime rest on his background seems boring and predictable set of fillers...  
 
Finally. 
The most beautiful and noble of all the anime I've ever seen. I think that «One Piece» in Russian — a world of the soul. 
 
Verdict. 
Masterpiece! 10/10.

    ""i have decided to be the king of pirates, so if i die fighting for that, that is fine with me"" this single line was so heart touching that made me a huge fan of one piece. The plot is very good, each and every arcs are really amazing the fights the humor everything went well except for one this sometimes the pace gets a bit slow. One thing fascinates me is the suspense,especially one piece the treasure except for the author no one have any clues 
 
Art 
The art work is pretty bad at the beginning i know at that time there wasn't any good animation but the developer tried their best to do and the art work is getting day by day. 
 
 
sound 
Oh! the music is superb, luffy's battle theme song always rings in my head, the opening and ending songs were great, the ost music is very good 
 
Character 
It is quite rare to see this kind of development of the characters like luffy and all of them had to work hard to get strong its not like they got powers from the beginning like other series, ihave to say the author did a pretty good job about the characters as if they were meant to be perfect from the beginning. The bond between the crew is inseparable, they would gladly risk their life to save their friends without out thinking twice. This gave me some feel to the series. 
 
 
Enjoyment 
i enjoyed it from top to bottom, i haven't experience a single moment that i was feeling bored, i watched 600 episodes non stop, i knew that i had to catch up to the recent episodes and thats why i stopped watching other shows for it and i am happy that i took the right decision. Normally i watch 5 to 7 episode a day but when i was watching one piece i use to watch 20 to 25 episodes a day that was a lot for me as well. i liked most of the part more like 98% of the show but i think the pace in which it is going is a bit slow not that much so 2% dislike for it other than that its amazing people should give it a try once

    When I first learned about One Piece, when i was a one track Narutard, i always said ""The art is weird"" or ""The voices suck"". And then i watched the original japanese version. The voices were amazing. Over time, i truly came to repsect Oda for making a unique style, and i love it now. The story is enthralling, and will take you for many spins. It truly makes you emotional at moments, and I adore the character development. Watch one piece. Its truly a thrill to watch and read.

    The overall premise of One Piece isa that the world is divided between pirates and Marines!  
Constently at each others necks resulting in grand battles, exhilarting fights, tear- worthy moments, meaning a whole lot of snot! 
Such moving story lines, that truly make you fall in love with the characters, and become invested in their dreams and aspirations. 
If during this anime you don't get emotionally moved, then your most likely dead inside.  
As we watch our heros battle their harships and as we fanboy/fangirl over their sheer badassness moments that not even the biggest narutards can object to! 
If this review will get at least one person to watch One Piece than I'd write it a thousand times.  
The voice acting is fantastic, especially when emotional moments are demanding more. 
Themes such true companionship, following your dreams no matter the hardship, and truly putting your life on the line for what you believe in, are played out truly beautifully. 
Almost changing part of the person experiencing the world of One Piece! Hands down this is truly a wonderful adventure. 
If i had one wish is that One Piece's grand existence never disappears, because this anime/manga is importilised in the heart of it's viewers. 
By the first episode this 'Monkey . D. Luffy' will have an impression on you whether you like it or not, and One Piece will simply never end from there.

    Life changing experience 
One piece is a very enjoyable adventure story with some really good characters and cool fights. Most people like one piece mainly because of this and because it has been good since it started. It never leaves you bored or disappointed. Even only for this it is good enough to call it one of the best anime of all time. But if you are looking for more than just that, if you need something more, i am sure you will find even more than you would expect. I am not saying that meaning is only good thing in things and thing can't be good if they don't have meaning in them, i believe art can have 0 meaning and still be amazing or can be ugly but have so much meaning that it still makes great art. I think One Piece is in perfect balance of how it looks and what meanings it has behind those looks. It kinda reminds me of The Matrix with that (great action movie and great meaning and philosophy behind it). 
 
I also want to write about main complains people have against One Piece. First would be animation. When i started watching One Piece i didn't like animation either, but than i got used to it. Not only that animation got much better after years and now i actually like it. I think the type of animation One Piece has may not be the best but its use to showcase character emotions is perfectly used (feeling can be exaggerated but it makes you feel it which is great use of animation in my opinion). Second main complaint people have would be that it is too long. It is too long but as I said before One piece will not make you feel bored. There are not much fillers in One Piece and when there are they are pretty enjoyable too. The last complaint would be that its story is repetitive. Most people who say that have watched like first few arcs when they were kids and they think that all there is to it is: they go to an island, fight, win, repeat. Well i understand why they say that but that's not really true if you watch it you will understand its not. Also people say it has too simple goal, Main hero wants to find the great treasure One Piece and become pirate king. It's not that much simple, in reality he doesn't really care about treasure or becoming a king, in his mind pirate king is a man who is most free, who can do anything he wants and that's his goal to be the most free person in the world. People who have a feeling in their life that people are trying to pull you down, trying to close your mind, trying to make you the same way they are will understand how much that means and that it is much more than just a treasure or a name of a king. 
 
The story of One Piece may be the best part of it. IT's long but not really drawn out. Eiichiro Oda created a whole world to explore together with great characters. And there are some things Oda obviously planed and wrote years before we saw it on anime and when we did it left mind-blown. And there are more thing waiting to be revealed in future too. It's a story about everything. Story about birth, death, being a parent, about brotherhood, about sacrifice, about loss, about friendship, about war, about peace, about freedom, about dreams, about life and existence itself and SO MUCH MORE there is no way you can count a all of it down. And it never get too annoying with one thing. It never gives you too much of anything that can make you bored. The story writing is so good that some 1 episode flashbacks can be as good and even better than whole great movies. For example one of flashback stories really reminded me of a great movie Life is beautiful and i even felt like this was better written. 
 
One piece changes your life. It changes you but it never gives you straight teaching how you should be or not be. There are just so many kinds of great characters and they just do their things and you relate to it. It never is like marines are good and pirates are bad, or pirates are good and marines are bad, there are good and bad people on both sides. Yes our main heroes are pirates but they never say pirates are all good, we see some pirates killing innocent people and marines who don't care about people. Characters never stand there and say something like: ""oh i am a good person and you should be too"". What you learn from One Piece comes itself. You watch characters, they go through something, that changes them and One Piece makes you feel like you are going through the same thing with them and it comes to you more like experience than as a lesson. You feel it and you get it. It never tells you what is right and what is wrong or what is good and what is bad. One Piece just makes you feel what characters feels and after that its up to you, its your own decision if you want to or what you will learn something from that feeling. 
 
In conclusion i would like to say that One Piece is not one of the best anime but also one of the best masterpieces of art ever created (and it's not even near finishing yet and i can already say so). One Piece won't make you disappointed. It may not mean as much to most of the other people out there but i can assure you at least this much that it will be enjoyable to watch for everyone. 
 
P.S. Don't watch English dub.

    One Piece is one of those anime that really pull you into its world. It had me hooked from episode 1 and before I knew it 8 months had passed and I had caught up on its many episodes, movies, specials, and any other content I could see. Now every Sunday when the new episode comes out I'm like a kid on Christmas morning. I know I'll be sailing with Monkey D. Luffy until the show's conclusion.  
Story: 10  
I gave the story a 10 because of how imaginative it truly is. Revelations and new developments in this story are constantly coming at you. This means the story never gets repetitive or boring. Additionally the story will have you asking yourself many interesting philosophical questions. Here are just a few of the questions this show may have you thinking about: 
What is Justice? 
What is good and evil?  
What is really important in life?  
What does it mean to be free?  
Better yet it does this without ever feeling preachy.  
The story also has great themes of friendship (friendships as strong as familial ties) and amazing adventure!  
Art: 10  
The art-style in this show is really unique. It is instantly recognizable and fits the show perfectly. All the color really brings the expansive One Piece world to life. Character designs are all very distinct and some of the most eye catching in anime. The fights and all the special attacks are breathtaking.  
Sound: 10  
The soundtrack in this show is extremely versatile and varied. It has pieces that fit every mood. The openings and endings all sound great. These tracks really provoke emotion. Songs that will make you smile ear to ear, songs that will make you sob, songs that make you feel tense and excited - It has it all!  
Characters: 10  
One Piece really shines in this category. Every character has a distinct personality, motives, beliefs, and their chance to shine in the story. The cast of characters are extremely lovable and quirky. Monkey D. Luffy and his crew all have hearts of gold.  
Enjoyment 10:  
I find One Piece extremely enjoyable. It has everything I am looking for in an anime. It keeps me excited, invested, and completely enamored with the characters and plot. It pulls you into its adventure so well!  
Overall: 10  
I would strongly advise watching this show. It is a time investment to watch all the way up to date, but I did it and it was well worth it to me. It is the kind of show that has something for everyone and so can be enjoyed by nearly anyone! Happy sailing!

    One piece is one of the best anime i've ever watched. I really had a great time watcing. I have nothing negative to say about it. The story is great..the art is good and the characters are just awesome!! I found myself fangirling so many times! Well, i'll have to admit that at first it wasn't that exciting and the art wasn't that good but now is so exciting that i find it very hard to wait every week for the new episode to be released and the art has improved too..Another thing that i liked was how nicely were the fillers put in the story. They weren't too long and they were put so cleverly in the story that i didn't even realize it was fillers. I also liked the comedy very much. It made me laugh so much so many times..!!!

    One Piece is honestly the best show I’ve ever watched in my entire life. What Oda, the creator of OP, gave us, was more than just a story - he gave us an entire world, filled with unique people with their own backstories. It takes the time to tell us about the different characters Luffy meets along the way, and all of their stories are somehow interconnected, whether it’s tragic or happy or strange or mysterious.  It really puts everything in perspective, y’know? That everyone on planet earth has their own story and there’s no end to it. 
 
It takes the time to show how its multidimensional characters grow, change, and how it affects the world. Or how it doesn’t affect the world. Like that dog back in Orange Town, who was just trying to protect his late master’s house… tons of instances like that is why I love One Piece. It’ll make you cry, laugh, smile, squeal in excitement, and just be in awe of how well put-together the world of One Piece is. 
 
It’s not just all about the characters, though. The overarching plot of One Piece is amazing, as well. In the world ruled by a corrupt government and pirates constantly battling for power, there’s always something new to see, and always something else to affect the plot. The essence of a plot is that it’s formed by hundred and hundreds of character decisions, and you begin to understand the story as you see said decisions being made. You’re shown all of the main character’s goals, and why. You’re shown why villains do what they do, and sometimes you even feel bad for them - like Arlong or Hody Jones, who grew up in hatred of humans from what they’d done to Fishman Island. You’re shown all of the evil of the world, and how it’s always going to be there, and that makes the world of OP that more realistic. You’re shown all of the good of the world, and how some even die in the name of justice, and how some even used to be villains. Everything you see in One Piece just… makes sense. It’s all interwoven - the characters, the backstories, the plot, everything.  
 
The wonderful world building, the incredible cast of rich, relatable characters, and the plot that makes you just ache to see the next episode makes watching One Piece through all the way worth it.  
 
I will say, this show wasn’t even in my top ten until around episode 100, and not in the top three until around three hundred. The first 20 or so episodes felt like a drag. Many are turned off by One Piece’s art, and others dislike the slow pace. I wasn’t too fond of either at first. Now, I believe One Piece is the best show - no, the best story in general to ever exist. 
 
If you haven’t watched One Piece, watch it. Now.  
 
 
Story: 10 - amazing, well-thought out plot 
Art: 7 - after the timeskip the art gets worse 
Sound: 8 - Music is awesome and catchy, & sound effects are shared w/ DBZ 
Character: 10 - great development and emotional moments 
Enjoyment: 10 - from squealing in excitement to being on the edge of my seat, damn have I enjoyed this anime

    One piece is my favorite anime of all time.  
I started watching it when i was around 8-10 years old, it was on the morning tv shows i would wake up early just to watch it. Later that day i would meet with my friends, we would chose one of the characters and play, i was Zoro so i had to go around looking for sticks to pretend they d be my all mighty swords. After it stopped airing i grew up and i forgot about it. At the age of 15 i don't even remember how or why i started re-watching it and since that day i ve been hooked up to the story line. 
 
For those who don't like long anime, why are you even here? One piece is known to be the longest anime airing, please don't belittle the show because of that, there are plenty of other shorter anime to watch. 
 
So here starts my review! (took me long enough huh) 
The story is about a boy who aims find the legendary treasure One piece and become the pirate King. Why you may ask? For wealth, fame, power? NO! because he wants to be the freest man in the world. Personally, i don't want him to find it, because when that happens it will mean one piece has ended and am gonna cry my self to sleep that night. (pretty mature ain't i huh) The show starts a bit slow with the main character recruiting friends but for me i didn't even realize how the time (episodes) passed. The anime offers you both great comedy and action at the exact amount you d want it, with great jokes and funny faces as well as amazing fights that aren't only about getting stronger just from yelling that you love your friends. Furthermore, as the story progress, it becomes a bit more serious but without ever lacking of comical moments. What i love about it is, that the protagonist doesn't always win, making your adrenaline pump because you don't expect the same result every single time. To conclude, the plot surprised me many times, a minor detail you saw at around episode 60 ends up being very important at for example episode 300 and you stand watching it and wander ""was the author always planning to do this? how can he think so far ahead"" 
The characters, every character is unique they have their own goals and aren't simple side kicks for the plots sake. Every character has a deep background, it makes you feel that you know them better, you end up laughing with them, crying with them, feeling their agony (am i getting to cliche? ) And that doesn't only apply to the main crew but foes and allies alike. Off course there will be characters you like more and characters you wish they die but never actually do but that happens because of the big character variety it has i think it s normal one or two are not that likable (for example whiny princesses that need help) Also, the characters progress through the story even the air head protagonist gets more serious by the time you ve reached half of the series. 
So, i ve blabbered enough, if you like long series, amazing action, comedy, character development i think you should give One piece a try. 
 
P.S. Does anyone actually scroll down to the last page to even see this ?

    It's a giant part of my life, I said I started watching this on 2009, and I did from the beginning, but on 2006 I started doing AMVs (Anime Music Videos) and I would listen to the 6th opening everyday, I love it. All in it. All characters, all their behaviour, I am so much like Luffy in terms of personality (and apethite, believe me, I know :3)  
 
This is better than Dragon Ball. Even if dragon ball was awesome, this is WAY more ""mature"" and it gives you tears and an unlimited number of lessons of life. 
 
One piece is the way to go! You might find voring first episodes, but after you watch 100 You only think: LUFFY LUFFY LUFFY LUFFY! ;D

    The most riveting story board I've come across. The characters show great dept in effort put forth in creating the tone of this show which changes accordingly. One piece is truly the most unique anime I know of. Though it has a bit a rough start (and was giving a bad rep due to 4kids tv's censorship+editing) it sets it a fire in the heart that only ever grows.

    This is gonna be short review that might seem like I'm about to commit seppuku. By the way it might contain a massive spoiler so that i might get my point across  
 
I like One Piece it's an awesome anime with lovable characters and a great story line.  The fights are good and the progression is at a steady pace but it really isn't for everyone, doesn't mater when you started watching it or at what age but it might not be for everyone and the reason I feel like such is its conflict/fights in it.  This has time and time again got me frustrated to a point where i put off the show and get on a self put hiatus.  People might say I'm being petty but it is really annoying, it feels like every fight they either have to stop and talk about their feelings or the good or bad guys trying and convince  
the either side that their way is best.  I know most shounen shows do this but how one piece does it is to a frustrating level.   
 
Where my spoiler comes in is in the fight between Luffy and Doflamingo.  Since this is after the time skip and a lot of episodes into the show you could say why is it that this particular fight is the reason I'm writing this review, well I always had a slight prick in the back of my mind when i watch the show and never really knew what it was about until i watching this sequence of episodes.  The fight just drags on and on and never really reaches a point till luffy unleashes his bouncy man move.   
 
The reason this fight is so draggy are those that i previously mention and why i wrote the review is when i re-watched Naruto Shippuden and watched the pain fight. It blew my mind and i got chills, the exact same ones i got when i was in grade 9 watching it for the first time and then it hit me the way this fight is portrayed and done is so good.   It give you the time for breathers and then throws you back in the action and if one piece could do this it might be skyrocket up my favourite anime list!

    if you watch it from the beginning you will notice how fun and great the show is and by the time you reach near episode 300 the show starts to show signs of BS like prolonging episodes to make so its an episode per chapter when the show is catching up to the manga and in later episode by the makers of Narutos anime and one piece having more money than any company  they still lower the quality from time to time even during easily animated scenes but other than that the show in all is fun for me it might be for you if you like the first 3 episodes

    One Piece has it's issues, and I am not going to deny that. The main issue I have, with the show, is the amount of episodes spent on a particular fight. To allow for more chapters of the manga to be written, a fight was stretched out to fill time. A normal episode of an anime is equivalent two chapters of the manga, the anime now only covers one chapter of material each episode.  
 
Continued signs, and evidence, are still in episodes every once in a while. To compensate for this, each manga chapter now has more content. Even with more manga content, some scenes will be mad longer than necessary. This someone comes off as satirical, and self aware, since the anime has so many episodes; the scenes come across as somewhat comedic. 
 
With all these issues in mind, I give One Piece a 10/10 (masterpiece).

    I will do overall review for One Piece again. Cause many things changed for the good and some for the bad. Im going to talk about the story, the Art, the sound, the characters and the enjoyment. Be warned cause spoilers can be contained. 
 
 
Story 
 
A lot of people would say that the story is the best. I would agree partially because  there are aspects that makes the story a bit too much repetetive. Its the concept of the story. For example the travel to every Island where the strawhats save the people from a villain or the sad backstories of every character. It gets really boring every time. What Oda can do really good is to describe problems with the world or islands. That is different every time. I like how deep it gets. We saw drugs, criminality, corruption, unfairness, wrong justice and so on. I love it in One Piece. 
In my opinion the concept of haki ruined a lot of things in One Piece. THe devil fruits have no more importance to win a fight, Especially armament haki and observation haki lets you dominate you in a fight. 
The story is toooooo much streched. OP should have ended long ago.  
 
Art 
 
Because of the fact that One Piece is a weekly anime the art suffered a lot of times. it was never consistent. Before timeskip it was a ride from different sheets and after time skip it stayed more consistent. In my opinion the wano art is the best. After that thriller Bark and then Enies Lobby. Yeah the wano art is now my favourite. It changed since Fukusawa stepped aside. He was was the one who was responsible for the Whole cake island arc. He did a wonderful job. I loved the last episode that he directed directly. Soul Pocus will be my favourite song of One Piece.  
Now lets beginn talking about Nagamine the director after Fukusawa. The character designer Hisada stepped aside too. I love that he stopped, because his sheets became worse after timeskip. After Matsuda took over the characters look more fresh than ever. Im interested how much Nagamines direction will be in Wano. Cause the arc is still going on and I dont want to talk so soon about this arcs art. 
 
 
Sound 
 
One Piece ha one of the best soundtracks but most of the times they use the same soundtracks over and over again. It gets really boring. THey use some sound from the film but not every time. 
In WCI i loved how they made a lot of tracks and musicials. Im excited about more Wano Soundtracks. I hope we will hear a lot of good tracks! 
 
Characters 
 
The characters that are introduced have a deep backstory and a lot of funny behavior. But I want to really say that it gets really boring by the time. The panty joke of Brook and the hit from nami after that  for example gets old.. What I really hate is that the Strawhats are not all strong. We have Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and JInbei who are really strong. The others like Robin, Usopp, Nami, Chopper and Brook are not that strong and can not keep up with the other strawhats.  
 
Enjoyment 
 
Here we come to a topic that has a real issue. The enjoyment. The problem with the anime since Thriller Bark arc is the unbearable pacing. We had Luffy running in marineford endlessly, a 6 months of Katakuri fighting Luffy, 3 months of shouting wedding cake by big mom etc. The manga adaptation is really like 10-13 chapters an episode. Yeah I understand that Toei is bounded to Stakehoulders like Shueisha and Fuji TV but It gets really problematic for me as a viewer to enjoy a series...

    One Piece is, magic. No show like this on earth. Able to consistently create extremely unique and imaginative aspects without being nonsensical. The PLOT, art style, characters, the backstories, the antagonists, the plot twists. Just absolutely incredible. As early as Nami’s Arc was when I saw One Piece for how truly amazing it was. That was the first of many of other arcs were I was moved to tears, ball in my throat level stuff. The Author of One Piece is incredible. Period. As for the characters; Samurai Champloo dub, Yu Yu Hakusho dub levels of chemistry. 
 
Despite semi-popular believe, One Piece did in fact kept it's momentum and magic after the time-skip. The most note-worthy, unmagical thing that's been added to One piece is this really really bad habit of stretching out arcs. There are 3 arcs in mind that were just insane. But yes, still amazing stories that tug your heart and great action scenes, animation, but when One Piece decides to put the story in syrup and take 15 episodes to progress something, they will do it with ease. Not my thing. As a non-manga guy, I've been told the newest arc airing and onwards is suppose to be a real treat and  departure from the inconsistencies. (Wano Arc is indeed rising to the occasion).  
 
Luffy is also an idiot but you are rewarded with Luffy going HAM at some point. Through the history of One Piece, the fights rarely ever disappoint. The OPs are always super sick as well. 
 
Additionally to the stretched out arcs comment, there are fillers in One Piece and some of them are in post time skip as well. To not making things any harder, I did check the fillers lists and it's really important to make sure you know exactly what you're skipping because few of them episodes advance the story/character develop. The cast is so awesome so of course I’d like to indulge in some fillers but a lot of the time they seriously come at VERY INOPPORTUNE times so naturally I want to skip them or at least the “true fillers”. I will watch them all real soon since I'm all caught up to the actual show.  
 
Objectively, One Piece is certainly a very high quality show in all aspects and one I think everybody should witness it first hand. I was very intimidated by the episodes count (as past first-timers usually were) so I put it off for a long time but once you suck it up and run though a few episodes, it's one of those shows you will not put down once you start. I'm here to stay. Sanji will find that All Blue!

    Plot(7/10): 
One piece starts off with a typical shounen plot but actually gets you hooked as it goes on with the story. It started with Luffy announcing his dream of being the pirate king and finding a crew that would help him sail through the seas to find the legendary treasure ""one piece"". The series is a great series for entertainment. The longer you watch it the more you get attached to the characters and the more it becomes fun to watch. I like how it foreshadows the future events in the story and how in each arc we learn more and more about the vast world of one piece and how the things that we learn makes us eager to learn more about the world of one piece. I also appreciate how connected the arcs are with each other and none of the arcs feel like a waste of time watching since for every arc we would get something that would greatly contribute to the development of the story. Even some filler arcs are fun to watch and it sometimes feels like you’re actually watching canon episodes. Since it is a well-known fact that Oda himself gives ideas on what should be included in the filler arcs and he sometimes adds stuff that aren’t in the manga to the anime. I highly recommend watching G-8 filler arc even though it is a filler arc since it fits well with the original story. 
 
While it is a fun show to watch there are some things that needs to be improved. The lack of deaths in the series makes the show annoying. There are a lot of characters that we are almost sure are dead that somehow manages to survive their inescapable deaths. This is more seen among allies of luffy. There are also a lot of inconsistencies in the plot yet that is to be expected from a big series like one piece. Some of the stuff are left unexplained leave the viewers clueless on how it happened. The pacing starting from thriller bark (around ep 300) gets slow yet picks up again in impel down arc (around ep 400). 
 
Art/animation (4/10) 
I personally don’t like the art of one piece that much. However one piece is an anime that has been going on since 2000 so it’s understandable that the animation would be poor in quality. The animation even in the fight scenes doesn’t look that good and sometimes makes climactic battles less exciting. 
Sound Effects (9/10) 
The sound effects for one piece is amazing. It blends well with the themes of the story. The sound effects hypes me up every time and makes scenes more exciting. The opening themes of the anime sounds great. The voice acting in the anime is great and voices of the characters fits them well and doesn’t get too annoying unlike some other shows. 
Characters (9/10) 
One of the things I like most about one piece is the characters. Each and every character that are introduced contributes to the development of the story. Some will help the crew, some will be an obstacle for the crew and some will actually join the crew. I like how each member of the straw hat grows as the story goes on and how each doesn't only follow Luffy blindly but each of them has their own goal that they must achieve. We can clearly see that oda gives emphasis to every member of the straw hat and not only on luffy since each of them are given obstacles that would make them grow individually. 
What I don’t like about the characters is Luffy himself. I don’t like how he is just the typical shounen main character who is dumb and just rushes in without thinking and somehow still manages to survive. However in the recent episodes Luffy’s character improves as he faces challenges that are too big for him forcing him to grow stronger in all aspects.

    This is a good show that asks too much of the average fan. 
 
I read the manga back in the Shounen Jump days and really like the art direction and stylization. It is a very fun and easy to follow show, with simple character motivations that all make pretty straightforward sense, except maybe for Nami. The arcs blend together and propel the characters onward, I ALWAYS felt like they were on the correct path and didn't feel like they were just twiddling their thumbs, waiting for the plot to happen. I stopped around episode 100 and don't really care to finish it, I feel like there would be a good plot waiting for me but I could never find a character I connected with on a personal level. The powers all seemed pretty logical and nothing ever seemed to contradict a rule that was established earlier, or if they did, it didn't bother me, as that wasn't the main focus of the story nor did it ever seem to impact whether or not the difficulty spiked for the main characters. 
 
Unfortunately all the characters kind of have the same basic facial structure, with all of them tending to blend together in my mind, so remembering who is who was difficult, which also turned me off and alienated the cast from me, I hated the reindeer, the idea of the setting being a pirate-filled ocean was cool at first but it seemed like most of the story took place on land and they never really ""pirated""... Kind just seemed like the word ""pirate"" meant ""warrior"" or ""fighter"" in this world. Not a huge flaw, but a flaw nonetheless.  
 
It's a good anime and a great manga, but it suffers from too many tropes and lack of individuality to be considered a truly great work of art, to me.

    I love One Piece. I love its story, the way they set a goal and deliver to their audience, the character developement, background... you get it. The thing is, I can not recommend this anime to anybody. All the things mentioned above are found in the manga and in the anime, but the latter absolutely destroys the hype, the pacing, and the viewer's eyeballs. So I just recommend reading the manga. 
 
The reasons I cant recommend it are the following: 
- As of right now, one chapter of manga equals one episode of anime, meaning that every anime episode is extremely slow paced and with excessively long and frequent freeze frames. 
- The animation is just dreadful... at the beginning it was fine, but around episode 400 the animation has gone downhill non-stop. And yes, I am aware that the animation gets better on the latest arc, but still, it's a good 500 episodes of thrash animation. 
 
It is really hard to watch something that you love get mistreated. That is why I decided to stop watching one piece and started reading it, the experience has been amazing so far, living each moment again, with proper pacing this time, and not feeling like I am wasting my time. If you want an amazing story with great, lovable characters and have a lot of time to spare, then prepare to embark in the amazing experience that is One Piece, but please, don't watch, just read.

    One Piece is the best anime there is. I have watched quite a lot of animes so far and at first I was a bit sceptical about One Piece. When I started watching the shonen, it seemed childish and boring. Art work is different and takes time getting used to. So after going through the first episodes I seriosly thought about dropping the whole thing. Soooo glad I didn't!!!!  
 
After a while I realised how unique One Piece is. The story is so well thought, like no other anime.  It can make you cry with the characters, laugh with them. Fights are epic! You really get hooked on the story, awlays wondering what's gonna happen next, what mystery is gonna be revelaed next.  
  
If you haven't seen it yet. DO IT!!!

    one piece is one of most unique shouen series in history bcoz of certain elements like : 
1.focus on each crew member showing why they are the way they are 
apart from main protagonist luffy every other crew mate has a proper back story,character,skill ,fighting style and a propose on the ship 
2.natural flow of story : another grt thing about it .Oda sensei's way of story telling unlike other shounen manga like dragonballz and naruto charcter dont just power up arc by arc as the story progress they grow stronger with time 
3.even if the show is 700+ episodes you don't get bored coz each island has its unique traits and villains and fun 
4.all around one piece make it worth your time

    I've always wanted to watch One Piece, after I've finished the exams, and i got my wish come true. Mostly, I had series of illnesses which were PAINFUL and ladies and gentlemen, One Piece kept my SANITY!! 
 
I can't thank enough, for the hours of enjoyment, determination and creativity given by Oda sensei. The jokes are original, you can keep on watching them and laugh. Music is good, needs improvement. One Piece had series of characters with different personalities.  
 
Art also needs improvement, but i think it's not because of the ability, OP has a unique style. Story was quite great, even though some arcs were way too long, the jokes keep you going in for more!! 
 
Overall, it's a great anime to watch! THANKS ONE PIECE!

    I know. 10 out of 10? Really? One Piece? Yeah right. 
 
Here me out. Is the art scaring you away? Some of the more ridiculous aspects of the characters, or plot? (There are a lot of those) The huge length of the series? (621+ episodes at present, 12 movies, 7 specials) 
 
Well let me ask you this, do you like an anime that is filled to the brim with unique characters, a fantastic story, extremely creative ideas, amazing action, hilarious comedy, extremely emotional moments, excellent drama, and wonderful world-building? An anime that is a far cry from other, more generic Shonen affair like Naruto (Dragon Ball Z) and Bleach (Yu Yu Hakusho)? An anime that has been consistently good, no, improved steadily over 14 years (manga's been going 16 years) and just keeps getting even better? If so you'll love One Piece. 
 
Eichiiro Oda has simply created a masterpiece here, One Piece fires on all cylinders and always succeeds. While wrapped up in zaniness (rubber pirates, transforming reindeer, weird powers, weirder designs, oh my!) One Piece has, at it's heart, such lovable, interesting, and unique characters who go on such a long, hard journey full of adventure. Along the way are plenty of heart-rending moments, One Piece is the only anime that's made me cry, and it's done so more than once! 
 
Not one character is the same, and each play off each other really well, to make a good deal of the comedy mentioned earlier. The characters are all very well developed and thought out, they each go through hard struggles as they attempt to bring their dreams and the dreams of their fellow friends to reality. The watcher becomes engrossed and involved with them, pretty soon you'll fall in love. 
 
The fights are incredible, the powers creative. The characters struggling in these conflicts are so interesting, both the Straw Hat Crew themselves, and the enemies they fight, you won't want to leave your seat. 
 
The sense of friendship, adventure, and fun are so contagious, you won't be able to help but smile after a particularly hard fight is done, or a new location is explored. No one location is the same, everywhere the crew visits is unique and interesting. 
 
The art might be off-putting, but I've grown to love it. I'm, sure not everyone will love it like I do, but I've heard of several fans who manage to at least like it a little. Sure it's weird. But it's much less generic looking than Bleach, for example. It adds a charm and a feel to One Piece that is all its own. 
 
The music is incredible. From the epic openings, to the adventurous endings, to the moving background music, this series delivers heavily in the music category. In some of the more emotional scenes the music really helps give that little push that sends a tear or two from my eye. In a scene where a fight is about to begin, tunes like Overtaken get you pumped up for the fight. The music on the high seas make you want to go adventuring with the Straw Hats as a pirate!The openings make you excited for the episode your'e about to watch, and the endings (which they later get rid of to make room for longer openings) make you want to watch the next one. The music goes the extra mile and makes One Piece more complete. 
 
Give it a chance, and you won't be disappointed, not one bit. I never expected One Piece to be my favorite anime, but it certainly has become so.

    Okay. One Piece, is easily the best anime I've seen so far. And I doubt I'll come across an anime better than OP.  
 
When I started watching OP, it was interesting. But it got boring quickly. I even dropped it around ep 50. But thanks to my cousin, who pushed me to continue watching, I continued. 
 
 It were a long, hundred some episodes I watched without really wanting to watch it. But it paid off. From there on, it became ridiculously great real quick.  
 
The story is what got me hooked in the first place, and the story just kept on progressing and progressing. The character development is outstanding, the emotional part is outstanding, and man, the comedy, is OUT. STANDING. I don't know how many times I've died laughing. And the potential of this anime is great, so it will only keep getting better and better.  
 
I haven't watched THAT many animes yet, but again, I doubt I'll come across an anime better than One Piece.

    For a long time, which series has been heralded as the best shounen of all time? DBZ? Hokuto? Naruto? Yu Yu Hakusho? 
 
Well it's neither. Because One Piece is one such shounen. Story wise, it is one of the best. The arcs protrayed are unique and interesting at every turn, with Oda always finding a way to surprise the reader with curve balls. The world of One Piece is one of the best, never have I seen such a world ripe with originality and creativity. 
 
Art wise? It evolves over time in the manga, and the anime art is a bit stagnant, but when the good fluid art is called for, it gets called. Not as good as most shounen but hey, art shouldn't be the be -all end-all. 
 
Sound? It's...okay. Some parts are good and unique and fit the story, although the soundtrack can get repetitive and they haven't really added anything new in a while. Plus the OP themes are hit or miss for me. 
 
The characters are fun to watch and it's cool to see them grow. Luffy? He's wiser now after the Marinford War(in his own way. See Fishman Island arc). Usopp? More like MANSOPP. I don't want to go paragraph into paragraph but all the characters grow and seeing them bloom is great. Plus they are fun to watch, love, hate, and admire. Plus there is some good comedy. 
 
Enjoyment? Easily a fun and enjoyable long running anime/manga. I enjoy every week there is a chapter or episode.

    If you looking for a good action/adventure/comedy anime with fun characters and a positive message I would try One Piece! 
One Piece is a anime/manga about Monkey D. Luffy along with his crew who set of on an adventure to find the treasure of Gol D. Roger and become the pirate king! 
While some dislike the art style i think it suits it well although, in the later episodes the quality drops a bit but, I would not let that turn you away but, if that does make you think twice try the manga. 
I have personally enjoyed every minute of One Piece and would highly recommend One Piece!

    Inherited Will, the Destiny of the Age, and the Dreams of its People. These are things that will not be stopped. As long as people continue to pursue the meaning of freedom, these things will never cease to be! 
Gol D. Roger 
 
As possibly derivable from the above quote. This is not just a story about some random pirate crew. But, contradictorily a story of adventure ,freedom ,friendship ,dream ,fate and resolve.  
One of the best out there, OP really has lived up to its name and is everyone's suitable cuisine. But, it is common for people who hasn't watched the series ignore it at a glance, mainly due to its cartoonish art. But that just mean that their sense of judgement is all clouded.  
 
BUT DON'T WORRY, WHEN alchemist111 IS HERE!!!(cause i'll set it right). 
 
Story-9/10  
Despite the the number of episodes it has, it garuntees 100% boredom free experience. The plot is interesting, despite the different arc's at times.  
The show's able to put up solid laughs often and some pretty excellent fights. Despite the odd art, the shows packs some fun.  
 
Art-8/10 
The art isn't that special and is just as i said above, has a rather odd and cartoony art. But this factor is not a burden to this epitome of a series. 
 
Sound-8/10 
Dont ask any questions and just go for the funimation dub, cause the other dubs seem to make the characters sound like kids. I mean, come on!! They must be at least 17. ''Oh god, Why art thou such mistress?''. And the OST isnt that bad either, but the dubbed one sounds better. 
 
Character-10/10 
Apart from the plot, the next interesting thing is the ships crew. Everyone has their way of being remembered by the viewers. Each of them has a certain ,character, personality and behaviour. And, the bond they carry with them has a significant role in their character development. Even though it may not seem like it cause, at times they act like , 
""I’ve set myself to become the King of the Pirates…and if I die trying…then at least I tried!"". 
Then after a moment they'll say, 
""If I get reincarnated…. I wanna become a clam.""  
 But then again their crew really does have some diversity ,indeed. 
 
Enjoyment-10/10 
Just as i said, this is an epitome of greatness. And such a series, will never fail to impress the viewer, even if it is a little bit.  
And as for the reluctants, i have one final thing to teach you.....""Never Judge A Book By Its Cover"".

    I know I could be overeacting but I think One Piece is the greatest shonen anime/manga ever. It's not overrated but underrated by people who thinks it is overrated. After watching, I started having less interest on average type of shonen anime except for Fairy Tail. Don't be misguided by ""A rubberman who wants find a treasure"" plot. The story has so many possibilities. Nevermind the art. I think it has the same art style as dragonball. People always says that Dragonball is like the greatest anime ever but I think One Piece is. It has the same quality of fight scenes, humor, art as dragonball but One Piece has a more deeper story line than dragonball. Since episode 1, the story of One Piece has only one goal that becomes broad and deep as the story progress unlike dragonball which is mostly about fighting every enemies that tries to invade planet earth. One Piece also has a great character development. Even supporting characters that you thought won't show up still shows up adding a great influence to the storyline. The only thing that I 'hate' about One Piece is that I just can't wait to see what happens at the end but it still has a long long long way to go.

    one piece in my opinion is a very good anime, alot of people might say its overrated, too long, too childish, too much stupid jokes and etc, and it totally is. but lets get serious for a moment 
 
just start watching, if you like it, watch more, if you dont, just stop, i dont understand how people can write comments here saying they hate this anime when they watched 600+ episodes, in my opinion i really like that the anime is long, after watching seven deadly sins, tokyo ghoul, code geass, hunter x hunter, full metal alchemist and alot more (btw i really recommend watching those animes) and after finishing it i was... truly sad, sad it ended, i really find it stupid but i actually cried when hunter x hunter ended, i hate losing a good anime,  the faith that an anime i truly love, One Piece will as alot of people say ""never end"" truly makes me happy, with Naruto dying and releasing too many fillers, and dragon ball super just releasing the same thing they showed in the movies in extreme detail, i escaped to one piece, dont regret that decision at all, im at 704 right now and still addicted to it, so please, dont listen to people who say its too long, too stupid and etc, just decide for yourself.

    One Piece was one of my favorite animes until episode 520, when they met back after 2 years. That was the last cool thing I saw in this show. The character become more stupid and they look stupid. Too much booobs. Most important was the style of the story telling, it changed. I loved the show, but I can't enjoy it any more. It become more like kids show, but with boooooobs.  
I finished my review, but the system required longer review. Every time I hit submit, it tell me please enter a longer review. This is the third time I hit submit, but same thing. Finaly....

    One Piece is as close as you can get to a perfect series. It puts Oda's hardwork from these past 20 years of putting his body through hell to produce the best of content for his fan's enjoyment. Character work, Backstories, Drama, Adventure, Mysteries, Over The Top Goals, World Building, you ask and Oda does it better than anyone. 
 
But Oda's work doesn't gets as much recognition from the newer generation to which 800+ episodes is a daunting task, which is true to say the least.  
Although getting into One Piece is hard to said the least i mean the number of episodes crushed my urge to watch the anime a couple of times until finally i decided to watch it. 
 
One Piece is all about pirates travelling through the vast seas looking for the great treasure named ""One Piece."" The one who will find the treasure will earn himself the title ""Pirate King"" something which every pirate on the seas wants to become.  
 
The former Pirate King, Gold Roger ushered the world into a great pirate era.  
 
""You want my treasure? You can have it! Search for it! I left everything i gathered together at that place!"" - Gold D Roger's dying words that drove countless people to become pirates in search of his treasure, One Piece. 
 
The Main Character named Monkey D Luffy idealizes Gold Roger and dreams of becoming the Pirate King by finding the One Piece. He is so obsessed with his dream, that his catchphrase is actually ""I am Luffy and i will be the king of pirates"" and he doesn't lets a single opportunity slide to let everyone knows about it. He later recruit his loyal crew as they travel through the harsh seas of the ""Grand Line"" while solving mysteries and defeating strong enemies in search of the One Piece and fulfill their individual dreams. 
 
If you want to start watching the anime i recommend you to watch the movie special : 
 
""The Episode Of East Blue"" 
 
-The Special Covers The First 44 Episodes of the anime 
The First 44 Episodes focus on the Main Character Luffy looking for members for his pirate crew. These episodes feature character arcs for the members he will recruit across 5 arcs. The arcs focus on their Character, Backstory and their motives so the audience can connect better with the characters. With this you could easily be hooked into watching the anime as was i 
 
If you find yourself interested in One Piece after watching the special and want to continue then continue on watching the next episode which is episode 45 and forward. However i have to say there are a lot of filler arc in one piece therefore the wiki is your best friend. All filler arcs are non cannon and just a waste of time in my opinion since it bring no plot driven trivia and just gives small jokes and in all honesty just by filler we can eliminate a few tens of episodes. 
 
And with that you should watch One Piece. Because if you don't you're missing out on a one of a kind show that make you experience all kinds of emotions.

    More character & plot development in a single arc than most anime series have throughout their entire run. Sometimes this series suffers a bit from the deadly ""Bleach-itis"" (a good show that is kept alive on a steady IV stream of filler arcs that serve very little to move the actual overall plot forward), but even then it's not TERRIBLE, and fortunately these arcs are not ALWAYS these monolithic full season filler arcs. But I would recommend finding a filler avoidance guide nonetheless.  
 
Boa is top-tier waifu material, not for her looks, but because she is hardcore ride or die, ready to take on the whole world for Luffy. Fuck you. Fight me.

    A lot of people seem to be hesitant about starting watching this anime which is completely understandable considering how many episodes it already has and how it isn't stopping anytime soon. I was like that too.  
But then when I one day started it I got so addicted I couldn't stop. The story is really basic and so vague the writer can literally add anything to it and it makes sense. The music is amazing and so are the characters. Some might say that the art style looks old which is kinda true but it changes a lot during the anime. 
If you truly like anime and have good taste, you will like this anime.

    One Piece sure was and is/always will be a great anime to go back to. The best part was all the journeys and the adventures they've had plus most of the battles were interesting. The Plot/Story was really planned out very well since one part led to another. Art was alright for an old anime and it improved throughout the years so that was a very nice thing to see. The Sound I really loved since both dub and sub was really well done plus the background sounds, really suited all the themes. Characters I think they did an outstanding job because all the characters were actually doing and filling in what their characters supposed to do also adds on the the enjoyment and entertainment. Overall I gave the anime a 9 because sure It had outstanding in most of the tasks but It lacked a little of the theme to wanting to watch more and more because of the long series.

    In the episodes I have seen so far, I have only really encountered two things that keep it from being perfect. The first being the art - it is far from being the best art I have seen in anime. However, for me this is easy to look past as the story and music is amazing. The other qualm that I have is the slow pacing. Because of this, I have not been able to continually watch the series. I watch an arc or two, then I put One Piece on hold. I watch other shorter anime until all the One Piece discussion and videos popping up on my Youtube feed rekindles my excitement to watch One Piece. Whenever I come back, I do not regret it.Each arc is thoroughly enjoyable with its character development and unique plot. The filler arcs in One Piece are some of the best if not the best filler arcs in anime. One Piece has made me cry more than any other anime - that may be because of the sheer amount of episodes, but that's not the point. Even if it takes you a decade, One Piece is definitely something worth watching. It has a bit of a rough start, but stick through it. Give it a shot, at least watch the first hundred episodes.

    The more I watch this anime… the more I hate it.  BUT I AM GOING TO TRY TO BE FAIR AND BALANCED. 
 
STORY:  The story an adventurous tale of a crew of ever expanding pirates and the cast constantly expands throughout the series.  The story is very character driven with lighthearted non-serious character moments.  The problem with this anime is that all the characters are terrible.  The characters have such contempt and disregard for each other… it makes me feel a range of apathy–hate for them.   
NOT A SPOILER…. But the ANIME SPOILS ITSELF:  The theme song actively will tell you when a character will end up joining the crew and ruins when an enemy will become an ally.  Nothing is left as a surprise.   
 
BATTLES:  They are usually quick and mindless themed around gaining new abilities or spotting obvious weaknesses. It is not done in the intelligent way that Naruto did.  Sometimes battles are so lazy and boring where an enemy, that previously beated Luffy, will go down in 1 hit instead of being something interesting.  The worst part of any action series is when the some of the fights are cut out of the show and impaled to have happened off-screen because that is lazy and happened a few too many times.  
 
HUMOR:  Basically the characters will all speak at the same time, saying the same thing in unison, as a joke… and it gets really old… really fast.  Other humor is derived from the one-dimensional character traits that feel so stereotypical and bland.  Luffy is stupid, random, and hungry so there I just gave you 75% of the jokes.  Hope you laughed… I did not. Everyone is in love with the red head female cast member who is selfish, greedy, and actively tries to hurts her own teammates. The liar in the group is very entertainingly funny.  The rest of the humor is heavy based in character moments that tend to get repetitive.  
 
SICK OF REUSED FOOTAGE:  The ending 1-3 mins of footage, from the previous episode, is often re-used at the beginning of the next episode so you will watch repeated footage constantly...  This gets worst and worst at the series goes on.  This is always an unacceptable practice.    
 
ART:  It has its own style is easy to appreciate and comes off as original, fresh, and cartoonishly lighthearted.  If the world was its own character it would be the best character of the series.  All the design chooses compliment the environment and story.  The outfit character’s ware is a reprobation of their one-dimensional personality and it works.  
 
CHARACTER:  The characters are mindless stereotypes that have no depth until the story randomly demands it and then quickly forgets it.  Luffy, as a main character is so dumb that it makes me hate this entire anime. Luffy is so one-dimential: gluttioness (hungry all the time so the humor falls flat), oblivious to the obvious, unintelligent (very gullible) and is someone I could never respect as a leader.  Luffy makes so many reckless mistakes it is hard to respect his character. The thing I hate the most about the anime is that Luffy will randomly take illogical counterintuitive actions like quitting in the middle of journey so he can give a speech that is supposed to come off as pensive/thoughtful but feels forced and out of place whenever these moments arrive.  It is like the writer is trying to give depth to characters by making them act out of character and it does not really work.  Luffy is the make OR break character you either LOVE him OR HATE him with no grey area.   
 
 
MUSIC:  Every sound fits the tone and nothing it out of place OR got too annoying.    
 
OVERALL: 
OVERALL: YOU WILL LIKE THIS IF:  You want something thoughtlessly light-hearted, episodically adventurous, like cartoon pirates with hearts of gold, OR enjoy the anime fool tropes.

    I am actually a hard-core Fairy Tail fan and it never occurred to me I should start watching other shounens until they stopped the anime for Fairy Tail. I've been hearing alot of good reccomandations for One Piece and so I decided to give it a whirl.  
 Story is 9, because there is not one moment you aren't on the edge of your seat or laughing like crazy. There are some filler episodes but, not too many to be irritating. 
 Art is very good. It's classic shounen style and doesn't make all the characters perfect or powerful. In a sense it's sort of realistic. But, there are times where the art can get very wierd like, sometimes Sanji's hair is flipped right, and sometimes left.  
 The sound is very high-quality and improves the watching experience by hundered-fold.  
 Character is WONDERFUL. There's alot of character devolopment yet, they always surprise you. I'm only down to 210 out of 621 episodes and I hear there are more crew members coming up and only makes me more excited to watch this show. 
 I enjoy this anime very much so far, and anyone who likes shounen anime will fall head over heels for this one.

    I believe One Piece is one of the few longest running anime since 1999. If my memory serves me correctly, I've only seen it a few times back in 2002 or 2003 in a channel in one of my country’s network, but I only started watching it seriously in original version back in 2009. Despite that, I am proud to say that I am a huge fan. 
 
About the STORY 
Story is very much original with different kinds of devil fruits users, Sky Island, Fishman Island, almost immortal Four Emperors, and lots of interesting yet weird people and animals in every island. Plot is packed with tons of adventure and actions at the same time you’ll laugh her hearts out. In every arc comes with the arrivals of new “NAKAMA” and new enemies which make it much more exciting because you know it will mean another marvelous adventure for the “MUGIWARA CREW”. Despite that, the main storyline is intact. One of the strongest points of this series is the seemingly endless adventure in every arc. Perhaps this series is the most adventure packed in the history of anime. You’ll experience not only adventure and laughter but at the same time you’ll experience a lot of drama not only with the main characters but also with supporting and recurring characters.  Oh! Did I mention how hilarious some of the characters are? Most especially Luffy, Chopper and Usopp. You will laugh your hearts out when watching these guys. The only flaw of One Piece, if I may add, is the obvious fact that it’s been running for so long but lots of questions are still not answered like what kind of person is Monkey D. Dragon? Who the hell are Kaido and Big Mam of the four emperors? What the hell is the so called One Piece? What happened in the “Void History” 900 years ago? Why the hell the revolutionaries still not making a move? I believe having lots of unnecessary side stories makes the story of One Piece run on a slow pace. Because of that, there are too much unwanted episodes. There are so much side stories that have no relation with the main storyline. I guess that’s one of the reasons why the series has been running for so long. It’s been more than a decade and it feels like the story is still not getting any closer with the main plot. But then again, I guess the whole point of the story is not the destination which is the place where they can find ONE PIECE but rather the whole journey towards it and the adventures that comes with it.

This series has been one of the longest running series so it is granted that there are a huge number of characters. Each of the main and supporting characters are very interesting, you would want more of them in the coming episodes. Because there is a wide range of characters to choose from and enough time to explore their backgrounds considering the series has been running for more than a decade now you won’t get tired with the different characters. I am personally interested with the real story behind the revolutionaries most importantly because it is led by Luffy’s father. But what’s the most interesting and strongest point of the series are the whole crew characters. You will witness how Luffy magnificently managed to persuade each of them despite having different objectives and goal on why they join the crew. It is amazing how every member manages to have teamwork despite their different individuality and of course, how so hilarious that they still support, trust, and follow their captain despite Luffy being weird and sometimes can be an idiot. And to add to that, every member has significant role on the ship and has interesting skills and abilities. You just have to see yourself how magnificent the whole crew when they do their fight scenes. Whenever you see them together led by Luffy, you just feel the coolness of their whole group. They are hilarious, strong, kind, and extremely likeable characters. I believe almost all of them are some of the most famous characters of all time. Not only that, you will feel proud how they’ve gotten so strong for this past decade. It’s like watching your child grow up.  
 
About MONKEY D. LUFFY 
The main protagonist, Luffy, is the number one character on my hundred best anime character lists. He is so strong not only physically but mentally and emotionally which shows how not only his friends but even his enemies are amaze about him. Like what Mihawk said, that one by one Luffy turns the people around him into his allies which is why that more than anyone else sailing the seas Luffy possesses the most terrifying power.  Not even realizing how a great man he is, that even the great Whitebeard, one of the emperor Shanks, the vice-captain Rayleigh, and even the enemies respects him, you will see how level-headed and dense Luffy can be. Though he can be so weird and stupid at times, which is one of the reasons why he is a lot more amazing and interesting than any other characters in any anime; you can still feel the sense of authority from him that really shows his capability as a captain. Funny that he can be so innocent yet so terrifyingly powerful. He personally picks out all his crewmates. He knows very well that there are things the even he can’t do, that’s why he trusts and have a strong faith towards his crewmates. Even if he’s very kind and most of the times acting like an idiot, he knows when to be strong and hard towards his crewmates because he carry the burden of being the captain and so he does important and harsh decisions in serious situations which make him a very effective leader. He doesn’t even need some monstrous supernatural energy or fictional magic to power-up. All he needs is the most basic for every living thing in the world, “FOOD” and he’s ready for some terrifying fight to the death. And to add, he doesn’t even looked like your typical action heroic type guy who have this certain coolness aura because of his outfit. My goodness, he’s just wearing a worn-out short, simple top, and plain slippers. I’ve never seen such plain looking protagonist in the hundred animes I’ve watched which I strongly believe the very reason why he’s the rarest male protagonist out there. Because of his weird antics, you wouldn’t even think how cool and amazing he is. And that makes him very original and most interesting character not only among the protagonist of all time but among all the characters in the anime world. I also love how much simple-minded he is and leave things to chances. I’ve been watching this series for so many years and my view about him never changed. In fact, every year I would find myself falling in love with his character more and more. I strongly believe that he’s the most amazing character ever made in the history of manga and anime. 
 
About the ANIMATION 
It may not have the best of the animation out there but still it is made amazingly in its own way. After so many years you can see its growth and you will realize that the animation is at best. The seiyus are also so amazing. They are well-picked and match perfectly with the characters. Most especially Luffy. I was even in shocked when I found out that his seiyu is actually a woman which makes her so talented. 
 
It’s been a long review; after all, the series has been running for more than a decade now. It would be a sin not to say all the pent up ideas, opinions, and comments. 
 
Be captivated with the amazing sleepyhead swordsman and almost like a vice-captain ZORO, the smart and greedy navigator NAMI, the hilarious and liar sharpshooter USOPP, the womanizer cook SANJI, the cute and scared cat doctor CHOPPER, the elegant and smart archeologists ROBIN, the hentai and cyborg shipwright FRANKY, the weird and funny musician BROOK, and of course, the hilarious, simpleminded, adventurous, weird, chivalrous, and absolutely cool captain MONKEY D. LUFFY. If you want to meet the most magnificent character ever in the history of animes then watch this. I won’t be exaggerating if I say that you will miss a great deal of your life if you won’t be hooked in this series. For so many years, I’ve been dying to see if Luffy can really be the “PIRATE KING”!

    A Great new take on pirates 
 
 
Story >>> 
 
The story of this anime is what really amazes me , the final objective is to become the pirate king that may leave you to think this will be the same old same old like beating pirate crews etc but if you think like that then you have another thing coming as the story of One Piece is deep & the focus on each character & their story is good. 
 
 
Animation >>> 
 
The animation is good & gives a really nice action adventure feel to the series , due to the art style used it may lack a bit of seriousness at times that you would get in many anime with dark style of animation like one seen in Full Metal Alchemist , but this was the best style for the series & i can't see any other style of animation working well for the series 
 
 
Sound >>> 
 
I Love the sound in One Piece , especially the specific themes that build you up for the moment , like the Overtaken theme that lead you up to big fights & Run Away theme when Luffy manages to escape from the enemy swiftly 
 
 
Characters >>> 
 
Not all anime show importance of each person no matter how lame you think he may be , One Piece Assigns roles to each characters who also have their dreams or ambitions to fulfill as their story progresses , even the minor characters that you think will go away in some time will have a major part to play in the story , you will like even those weird looking characters & be touched emotionally if something bad happens to them 
 
 
Enjoyment >>> 
 
 
I Really enjoyed watching this anime so much that at times i think man how awesome it would be if i was was alive back a few centuries ago & roam the sea with my friends instead of robbing people , this new take on pirates is simply awesome 
 
 
Final Verdict >>> 
 
This anime series is what makes your anime experience complete you simply can't miss this series.

    One Piece. Where do I even begin? 
 
I have finally caught up with One Piece to where it’s currently airing on TV. In the past three or so months I spent an average of 6.6 episodes per day watching One Piece, from episode 11 to episode 767, not counting filler. 
 
I will lay out this review first by themes, then by other aspects. 
 
JUSTICE. There are two main forces of power in this world created by Eiichiro Oda, the Marines and the pirates. The Marines purport to uphold justice, even wearing the word on the back of their cloaks. They view the pirates as criminals just for being pirates, as if being a pirate as of itself is wrong. Much of the conflict in One Piece (OP) is generated by the Marines’ going after pirates. Thus the renowned pirates are given bounties, the higher meaning the more wanted (and thus the more powerful). Behind the Marines is the World Government (WG). As you watch more and more story arcs, you begin to realize that much of the corruption present on each island is allowed by the WG; thus, each time the Straw Hats encounter an island’s dark history and events behind the curtain, it’s a microcosm for the corruption of the world as a whole, overseen by the WG. This is not justice, whatever ideal the Marines aggrandize -- a better form of “justice” is in fact what the Straw Hats enact. Each time the Straw Hats land, they can’t help but assist the island’s inhabitants, and make gratified friends along the way; the Straw Hats are the true enforcers of justice in OP. They completely flip the stereotypical idea of the pirate, the pillager and looter and killer; to be a pirate is simply to enjoy adventure to the fullest. 
 
NAKAMA. The Japanese word for friend, comrade, compatriot, etc. No other anime uses this word as much as OP, no other character as much as Luffy. In OP, it’s used to mean friend, yes, but for those dear to Luffy like his crew, it means something closer than family. We humans are social animals and thrive on interpersonal interaction and attachment, whether familial or of friendship or romantic; thus we can empathize with the strong ties of loyalty in the Straw Hat crew as they fight various enemies together. Luffy cares deeply for his fellow Straw Hats; he cannot bear the notion of someone leaving the crew. The moments when he cries, like really cries with water flooding out of his eyes, are rare in OP; such moments only occur when Luffy loses someone close to him or otherwise experiences deep emotion related to friendship. Another, lesser, word for friend is tomodachi, which is also used often but just for friend as we know the word; not in the strong, pure sense that we know as nakama. This theme, as you may know, is also prevalent in Fairy Tail, whose guilds are like pirate crews in OP. Although Fairy Tail’s strong bonds of loyalty and friendship are true, they cannot surpass those in OP. I cried so much watching OP. Watching OP, I look at my circle of friends and realize that there are few, if any, I can call nakama. Sad, isn’t it. 
 
A SAD STORY. Whenever a new Straw Hat joins the crew, his/her backstory is revealed; and man, they’re all sad and heart-rending. These characters! Some may say that the Straw Hats don’t undergo major character development throughout the story; but imagine the Straw Hats without their special quirks and you’d miss it. It’s inherent to OP and ultimately necessary. Even though they may do the same peculiar things over and over again, it’s never boring to see again. 
 
THE ONE PIECE. The plot of OP in short is Luffy’s journey to find the One Piece, a treasure left behind by the former king of the pirates, Gol D. Roger, who announced such a thing at his execution. Luffy’s typical introduction at the start of the series goes something like “I’m Monkey D. Luffy and I want to become the king of the pirates.” Those who hear just laugh, for such an idea is absurd, because there are SO MANY incredibly powerful pirates out there and the seas are so expansive and you’d basically have to become the top pirate to achieve something like that. Luffy has this dream, and he’s willing to die fighting for it because at least he tried. Watching OP is so inspiring to me, with my own unrealistic dreams, to follow such dreams and fight for them. Not completely literally of course, but to work at it. A dream is only impossible if you give up. 
 
THE ADVENTURE. The plot sounds simple, doesn’t it? Monkey D. Luffy, a pirate sailing the seas to become the king of the pirates. Oh no. For the creators of worlds, there are few I call true masterminds, geniuses, who are in complete control of their worldbuilding and have done so much planning and creating to the point where you’re confused and intrigued all at once -- for fantasy I name George R. R. Martin and Steven Erikson; for anime I name Eiichiro Oda. In this immensely long series, 768 episodes to date, he brings back characters introduced hundreds, I mean literally hundreds, of episodes earlier; whenever the Straw Hats do something big and the news spreads around the world, you see friends and people from their respective pasts reading about them; over and over again he introduces new characters, with unique powers and strengths and quirks; he describes island after island after island. Pirates sail from the North, South, East and West Blue to the Grand Line, and from the Grand Line to the New World. Honestly, I don’t know how big the Earth in OP is. 
 
SHOUNEN. The levels of power are insane; as a shounen anime, OP is expected to have lots of fighting and lots of strong characters. I mean, looking back to how Luffy fought in East Blue and comparing it to how he can fight now, like, it’s freakin’ amazing, the power differential. That sense of awe and wonder when powerful characters are briefly shown on the screen, you know what I mean, or when they’re mentioned in conversation -- like when Laxus and Mystogan are first mentioned in Fairy Tail, or when you see the 13 court guard squad captains arrayed at table in Bleach, or the introduction of all the S-class heroes in One Punch Man, or… you get the idea. OP has this feeling hyped, jacked, on steroids, whatever, thrust to the skies and beyond. There are so many, and I repeat, so many, powerful pirates and Marines in OP. It’s crazy. This world that Oda has imagined and put to manga, I would go insane trying to remember everything. Which leads me to my next topic. 
 
DEVIL FRUITS. Now this is what makes OP especially awesome. There are these so-called “Devil Fruits” that are cursed because after you eat one, you can’t swim; when you go into water, your body is weakened and you eventually sink. The upside? Each Devil Fruit, and no two are the same, gives you one of three types of powers, I won’t describe them here because that’s not revealed all at the beginning of the anime, but the main Devil Fruit user is Luffy himself, who ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi (rubber-rubber fruit) and can stretch like rubber because he’s in essence a rubber man. And there are a lot more users in OP. Each fight between two Devil Fruit users is unique, because, as materials or elements or even concepts, some Devil Fruits are naturally stronger than others. No Devil Fruit is almighty, in other words. It’s like Avatar: The Last Airbender but exponentially exploded. Much more than merely fire, water, earth and air is in OP. Get ready for some creative fights. Now, the fight scenes in OP obviously aren’t as good as those in, say, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works; watching them is awesome not necessarily for the fighting quality, but more for what significance the fight’s outcome holds, for how the characters have gotten stronger, for how these guys can fight in the first place. There are, like, an infinite number of ways to fight in OP. Now. Practically all shounen anime has this thing for announcing fight moves with special names, like “Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu” in Naruto or “Fire Dragon’s Roar” in Fairy Tail or “Tensa Zangetsu” in Bleach, just to name a few. Some would point this out as a flaw in shounen; but I say no, imagine watching the anime fight scenes without the moves announced, and it’s vastly different. It’s necessary. Each technique is named, and thus exists. For something to exist, it has to be recognized; in short, given a name. Besides, when these characters fight, they worked on their various moves and abilities and thus have pride in proclaiming each technique when using it. 
 
INHERITED WILL. Nothing else to be said here; this is a crucial part of OP, but I can’t say too much about it here. 
 
GRADUAL REVELATION. Did I mention Oda was a genius? Another thing he does brilliantly is slowly, bit by bit, reveal more about Devil Fruits, the Grand Line, the history of the world, what the hell is even going on in his world. Even now, after 767 episodes, I honestly don’t know shit. I know some things, but not enough. All the more to look forward to in upcoming episodes! What’s more, the more you watch, the more of an overarching plot is shown; and the implications are huge. 
 
That being said, OP also has an amazing soundtrack. Of course tracks repeat for certain types of situations but the composer can only come up with so many different pieces for such a long anime. Very cinematic, reminiscent of film scores; OP has the most soundtrack music good enough to download onto my phone out of any anime I've seen. 
 
The animation may throw you off. It threw me off and was the biggest reason, that and the length of the show, for my not watching OP. I started episode 1 and it didn’t throw me off one bit. Compared to anime like Angel Beats! or Clannad or Code Geass, the character designs in OP are actually pretty realistic; goofy, but realistic. The original style of animation in OP has this gentle, touching quality to it. And it only gets better. Okay, it does get less three-dimensional and more clear-cut, but the clarity, the visual caliber, is another thing to look forward to when watching OP. Several times while on my OP journey I was eager to watch OP just for the improved animation. Comparing episode 1 to episode 767, I mean, damn. It’s changed so much. One thing I particularly like about OP is its many close shots of faces. So awesome. 
 
The story? It’s the best-planned, best-written, best-imagined story I’ve ever seen in anime. Once it finishes, and let’s hope Oda stays in good health, it will be deemed one of the best classics of any medium, I have no doubt about it. Each story arc is so complex and elaborate and detailed, they’re long but it’s realistic because there are so many factors in conflict so it takes time to resolve. 
 
Enjoyment? My first semester of my freshman year of college can be summed up by two words: ONE PIECE. 
 
My last words, my call to all anime viewers out there; no, to anybody in search of a reason to cry, to laugh, to be pumped up, to dream: 
 
Live, and fight for your dream; live, and be with your nakama. This world we live in may not be as romantic as that of One Piece, but it is beautiful just the same. Go into that romance dawn and sail your own adventure. 
 
What is your One Piece?

    So first I want to say that this is one of the biggest packages of just pure fun you can pick up and watch. Seriously it sucks you right in and you will really love the world and want to be a part of the Straw Hats I guarantee that.  
 
Story: 10 
It is a huge goal layered with a ton of interesting challenges, places, adventures, characters, and more along the way. This makes a really fun and exciting story as Luffy and his crew make their way to the One Piece as they grow and you see more about the world and learn more about the crew and their ongoing and strengthening connections they build with each other. Their world is captivating and just awesome.  
 
Art: 9  
Some people do not like the art. I agree halfway and here is why. I love the pre-newworld art. I think it is unique and goes with the theme this show has so well. The newworld art style I am not as big a fan of but its growing on me and I am really starting to like it as much as the old style. The art is great because it is different then your cliche anime art style.  
 
Sound: 9 
Great songs and that go great with the themes and fight scenes. You will be humming them whether you notice or not haha 
 
Character:10 
Some of the most likable and enjoyable characters ever are in this show. Luffy and Zoro alone already make the list of characters a 10 but then add the rest of the crew who all have great and back stories and you have some serious potential and it delivers! The show does a fantastic job of showing the teamwork and strong bonds the crew has which is an essential part of the show and the connections always build.  
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Like I said before. This show is pure fun. It also can be extremely serious and intense when it needs to be. You will get hooked on this show and love every second of it. The worst part of the show is when you catch up and go...wait only one episode a week...im going to die.. 
 
Overall:10 
Watch it just do it. It should be on every anime watchers list.

    Such a horrible fate One piece has to find himself being produced by Toei Animation studios.  
 
There is no doubt that one piece is awesome if we talk about the story. The universe is attracting, characters are lovable and it follows a certain logic that fit perfectly the shounen manga world, from this point of view you will definitly have a hard time finding a manga with such big and coherant world and at the same time light-hearted. So story 8/10.  
 
[IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH ONE PIECE PASS ONTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT HINT ABOUT THE STORY] 
The only problem that i could spot in the story is the recent developpement of 
Sanji,Usopp and Brook. The author has quite ignored sanji and brook, and make usopp a good for nothing, succeeding in enormous proportions because of his luck and not his will to become a great pirate. And that sacrifice of the character only for some gags that are not funny is in my point of view very absurd. If we were 5 Years in the past and you were telling me Usopp's storyline from the dressrosa Arc, i'm not sure if i would want to talk with you again...   
 
For the character developpement, i'm sadened that the author of the pillar of the shounen world (so children story) actually has the systematic tendency to over-sexualise the body of the women in his story. The binary vision of the pretty women with big boobs and a perfect waist in the opposite of the ugly women is really disturbing and can opress the lector. Because of these two point i gave 6/10 note for Characters. 
 
Soundtrack is awesome and voice characters too so : 8/10. 
 
When in the vast majority of anime adaptations the anime make the story even more interesting and pretty. One piece is the exact inverse case. From static plans being abused to bad drawings, bad and awfully long animations and a pacing utterly slow, the dynamics of fights is impacted negatively.  
It's because the studio has make the awfull choice to animate one chapter per episode, have you seen in an anime a character yelling 2 times in the same scene his attack's name, then you haven't seen one piece anime.  
Some scene are very far from being honest with the manga. So i put 1/10 for the Art.  
 
Overall, don't lose your time watching one piece anime, buy the books you'll definitly enjoy better the story. I put 1/10 Overall because i think 8/10 for this anime is defintely too much, i would put 4/10, but my opinion is that this anime does not represent the manga correctly. It's not for nothing that a project named ""One pace"" (Removing all sort of bad scene) exist for this series.

    Why this anime surprises me? I love the characters' moviment and voices, the musics are great at any moment that happen, making a climate very beautiful and exciting. The fillers which have in the anime (but not in the manga) are very funny and fun (although it's too slow), I really like them because there are so many interesting things to see (of course, there are another fillers which aren't so good, but it's worth watching, in my opinion.). I never skip the episodes, because there are something that may be relevant. 
 
 
But there are somethings in One Piece that I don't like the exaggerated fanservice and how the anime waste time with things unnecessery at one episode. As I am a girl, I think the One Piece's girls should be more exploited in your power and personality, and shouldn't be represented by big breasts and thin waist, that is disproportionate. 
 
 
That's my opinion about the anime, I really prefer the manga. But see the anime too, as I said, it's worth watching by the characters' voices and the musics, the moments are more impressives when you're watching. One Piece has very lessons to learn and the history is very good, if you read or watch, I'm sure you will find epic moments.

    So, Today I sat down and watched a good 20-30 episodes of One Piece.  One Piece, for me has been an anime that I'd always sit down and watch every *now and then*, but because of its slow start it was a show that I thought of as ""nothing special"".   
 
Today, on the other hand, after I experienced the back story's of Sanji (The Chef), Zoro (The Pirate Hunter), and Nami (The Navigator) I realized that this may indeed be a shounen, it's silly, outrageous and a great laugh, but at the same time it's a maturely themed show; especially considering the Nami arc. 
 
This is just but a preliminary review, I'm currently on episode 53/461, and I'm enjoying every waking minute of it.  The OP and ED themes (The introduction/Closing) are fantastic.  Character wise there's a great balance of archetypes; the only one of which I really find annoying is Usopp. 
 
The sound is generally a good mix of classical to highlight and emphasize critical moments, rising action, climaxes and such, it's very subtle, but well thought out.  Character development is great and I hope it will keep getting better.  The art work is simple but it brings out enough in terms of persona that I rated it quite decently.  
 
Overall, this anime ranks as my favorite, most enjoyable anime so far (and I've watched a lot of anime!) It's just a wacky, zany adventure that you really don't want to miss out on.  I couldn't believe that the story was able to make me hate and detest certain characters and so on & so forth. Amazing Show.

    (Caution: you don't have to read my foreword unless you want to, the review according to the rating starts at the ''CHRONOLOGICAL RATING:'' title) 
 
Woah! That is certainly my expression through watching the whole anime, and yet it has not ended! I am actually not sure wether I should rate it as superior or inferior to other animes. That is why I decided to make a review on my very personal level.  
 
I remember when I saw one of my tight friends in high school watching One Piece at my place (in fact this was before I even watched any animes). However I also got this flashback of my pathetic old self just sitting there in the chair next to him thinking ''WTF is this bullsh*t'' Y'know the one kind that hasn't even tried anime in his/her whole life - which means I WAS an outsider afterall, so that being said I'm definitely ready to give creds to my thankable old friend who watched One Piece while I was being stubborn.. 
 
Enough of the history about me, since it's... ...lets say ''half irrelevant'' to the review. 
 
One piece is the kind of anime not to be taken lightly. Do not understand me though, it's not a negative nor a positive statement, it's just me speaking for a more neutral side. I just need to point out that there is no such thing as ''this is the anime you should watch for the first one'' neither ''this is NOT the anime you should watch for the first time'' - as it depends highly on your own choice of categorizing. 
 
But as I'm speaking for myself, this anime had to bring down much of my time so I can recommend to plan a little better, since 'my' planning along with the animes timeline went to hell.  So to simplify: One Piece is NOT beneficial if you don't have the time to watch it... well beneficial might be the wrong word but I hope you'll understand my way of thinking. 
 
CHRONOLOGICAL RATING: 
 
Story: 9 (Great) 
- The story made me cry several times, mostly because of the amazing family-history of the main character: Luffy, but also because you will go through all of his crew while it's holding a really epic surrounding which is also timing to the enjoyment. However I still need to point out that this might not happen to those who prefer the story background and everything to be shorter. 
 
Art: 7 (Good) 
- In the beginning I was almost instantly convinced that the draw quality wasn't the ace of this anime (which many anime- and manga companies choose to have). But I still need to say ''no shit'' because I realized soon enough that One Piece airing date was kind of old - which by the way gave me a really negative feeling in the start... ...Though that feeling was soon about to be erased! I probably gave it 100 episodes and the art was shining already. Because the looks didn't matter anymore - which certainly makes me want to say ''Don't judge the book by it's cover''. As I get pretty long into the anime I get to the point where the art suddenly gets even better! I'm sure all of you know the pissed-off badass'' kind of face'' of a person who is very angry yet doesn't say a word, y'know the ''state of concentration''. Well I'm glad to bring you good news because One Piece definitely has it, which is also timed according to good moments to do so (well some moments may be for the sake of comedy, but even that has it's point). So potentially speaking, the art to me is not even worth being on the rating-table because it does not even matter, as I said do not judge it by the cover because then you will most likely quit after a few minutes. Give it some time. 
 
Sound: 8 (Very Good) 
- Haha, one thing that for some weird reason got me was that the voice actor for the main character is a woman and not a boy. Do not let this concern you because I definitely wouldn't believe it until I saw it officially on myanimeist. No but seriously the voice acting is very good and specially the main characters in the anime(Luffys and his crew). As for the opening- and ending songs: 7 in my opinion, after hearing it in several episodes. It even approved the anime a bit and it made it more ''cosy''. 
 
Character: 8 (Very Good) 
- As almost being said in the art section - the characters definitely are amazing, epic, wild and yet even lovely for some weird reason. Luffy the main character of the series is bringing the best outcome of all of them, he has this really amazing and ''I don't give a fuck about superiors'' aura. I mean he can pretty much stand up to god with his expression that will make most of the supporting characters laugh! And that is also what makes his nakamas(crew) even more enjoyable, because he influences them too eventually. He will appear as dumb and retarded as well, but in the end that's just nothing compared to his badass expression when he puts up a fight among the pirates! Which will also make you smile, because his enemies or rivals will definitely first have the kind of expression ''This kid is stupid''. But as I said in the end, Luffy doesn't give a shit, he and his nakamas has this aura among them selves that says ''I've already decided to kick your ass''. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 6 & 8 (Fair and Good) 
- The enjoyment rating may come as a kind of ''Plot Twist'' in this review but to me just a single number is not a persons true feeling. ''Fair'' it says. But here is where I come in and say that One Piece still has it's up and downs. Because I gave it a lot of time, which by the way destroyed my sleep and eventually made me exhausted. Sure you can either disagree or agree with me, but let me just say it: One Piece truly was great, but at some point in this exhausted area I had... ...I truly wanted to skip a few episodes. So here is a lesson when watching One Piece: Whatever you decide, think about it. Do not force your sleep down to 6 pm. Once I was craving for sleep, the day after was like a hangover! (Only a suggestion though) If you decide to watch One Piece and love it to the end, I guess you were proving me wrong.

    One piece is an anime series about a Pirate named Luffy and his journey to try and become the King of Pirates. Along the way he and his crew get into a lot of amazing adventures, like trying to save a kingdom from a criminal organisation, Going to an island in the sky, and many more! 
 
People who hate on One Piece are pretty much the average ""Anime Hipsters"" you'll find on this site. A lot of people say the anime has gotten worse after the time skip, but honestly i'm still loving it, and if you're not bored of a series 550 episodes in then it deserves a 10/10 in my opinion. I definitely recommend this series to anyone looking for an anime with a lot of episodes. However, it does get slow at times, so if you're impatient it might not be for you as there are almost 1000 episodes.

    Best thing I ever watch/read/seen in my life. And trust me I've seen a lot from Indian cinema to Hollywood, but there's nothing as legendary as One Piece. It is the most special thing in my life. Obviously, the manga is on a whole new level, but the anime adaptation of the greatest comic book of all time does justice to the manga. Only one reason is enough to say that the anime does justice to the manga and it is the Japanese  voice cast. They give life to the characters.  
Art: Oda's art, duh. But the animation gets a little mediocre after time skip but that shouldn't worry you if you're a One Piece. 9/10 
Story: The greatest story mankind has ever come up with. 10/10 
Sound: Good choice and one of the most iconic Shonen music + the voice cast. 10/10 
Character: Every character is close to my heart, every One Piece fan at this situation should be biased, cause they are the greatest fictional characters. 10/10 
Enjoyment: The greatest form of entertainment a living creature can ever witness. One Piece is a true treasure. 10/10 
Overall: The greatest anime of all time, the best fictional universe of all time, the most beautiful treasure.  
Thank you, Oda sensei.

    Awesome and long. Long enough to take up your whole summer if you start from the start but tasteful enough to make it worth it. If the sheer number of episodes scare you from starting to watch this anime then don't worry, if you skip the intro theme song and recap each episode can be done in 15-20 mins. this anime is all about a character named Luffy who starts of as a weak nobody gathering friends along the way who help him achieve his dream while trying to accomplish their personal goals. The character development for each and every character doesn't seem to stop which is awesome for such a long anime and even some of the enemies and acquaintances keep getting stronger (not spoiling much :P). The anime is expected to be roughly 1200 episodes long and Luffy has already gone through a lot up till now but surely the bigger and more badass stories are yet to come.

    This is definitely one of the best anime`s out there. Personally it`s my second favorite anime under Naruto, there are alot of episodes to this but it really pays off. It does start off quite slow so you need to give it some time. I recommend watching this casually for the first 100 episodes or so. It``s not something you can binge right away, first you get attatched to the characters and the story then it really picks up. You`ll eat the episodes up like candy. 
 
Story:  
The overall story to this is quite good. At first it may not seem too great but trust me they really tie everything in quite well. It mostly feels like a big adventure, Luffy sailing around the sea gaining allies and defeating enemies.  
 
Art: 
This anime did start a long time ago so once you first start this it will be a bit outdated. But as you progress throught the episodes you will see a definite increase int he quality. 
 
Sound:  
The sound in this is nothing special, the voice actors are quite good and the intros aren`t bad but they arent the best. 
 
characters: 
The best part about this anime are all of the characters you meet. Luffy picks up crewmates along his journey and you really grow attacched to all of them. It`s quite fun to watch all of his friends grow stronger and closer alongside Luffy through their adventures. 
 
Overall: 
I would highly recommend this anime to anyone. It has a little bit of everything. It can be slow at times but it`ll usually make up for that with epic moments. It also has some of the best comedy in any anime. Take your time and enjoy it.

    Story 
For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. 
 
Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. 
 
Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. 
 
This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? 
 
The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. 
 
With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. 
 
With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. 
 
 
Animation 
Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. 
 
The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. 
 
Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. 
 
 
Sound 
Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. 
 
Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). 
 
 
Characters 
Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. 
 
The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). 
 
However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. 
 
Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. 
 
My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. 
 
 
Overall 
Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time where One Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. 
 
However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.

    I'll say it, this show is amazing, it is a deep telling of boy who wants to be free. One Piece sets up a huge and entertaining world with endless possibilities. Luffy is searching for the one piece, he gathers together and sets out to the grand line. 
 
Story:  I'm not going to lie, the story has a very basic cycle openly but it has a main story building in the background. The story typically plays out with Luffy arriving at an island, the people are friendly but something is wrong. the person controlling the island is evil and must be stopped. Luffy has no reason to help but he gets so pissed of at whatever is wrong that he makes a promise to a member of the island (typically a girl) that he will kick the villians ass. The very often 2D villain is evil for evils sake gets beaten off as Luffys crew in order of importance defeats his underlings. After this they have a party and leave. this cycle is repeated with something little being added to the overall story every arc, This building up to a dramamtic ending.  
 
Art: I don't have to say much about this, its horrible but you will get used to it.  
 
Sound: the soundtrack is awesome, I listen to the individual tracks all the time, adds something to every scene. 
 
Character: Luffy is a life loving badass, undereducated, simple minded, strong moraled and willed pirate. He sets his mind to something and does it, he has no fear which builds into his badass nature. His character changes after a serious event before a 2 year time skip and he developes a sense of what its like to be scared and powerless. However with how good Luffy is, most of his crew is 2D. With the exception of Roronoa Zoro, he's first mate and swordsmen.  
 
Enjoyment:  For me their is nothing more important then enjoyment in a show. I can say without a doubt you will enjoy this show, it is a feel good joy ride that always leaves you with a smile. it sets up a grand scale world with many lovable characters.  
 
Overall: This show is exciting, engaging and allows you to leave the world and engulf yourself in a fantasy world like no other. I'm sure anyone who watches this will atleast leave with a smile, it is wonderful.

    Writing a review on One Piece is very difficult. 
With over 740 episodes and counting it is one of the biggest shows ever. It is only logical that there is a wide range of quality to be seen here.  
Some of the story arcs are genius (Enie's Lobby) while others should have been left out because they are either way too long (i'm looking at you thriller bark) or simply not good.  
 
Unlike any other anime, this one got me hooked for more than 200 episodes. I just couldn't stop watching which resulted in heavy binge-watching sessions which cut out my social life for more than a weak. How did One Piece do that? First of all, the characters. The characters are One Piece's biggest strength and probably the reason why it is that popular. They are unique, they are funny and remain interesting. While Ruffy is our main character here, One Piece gives his sidekicks way more love than any other anime series. Each of them has a heart-breaking past of his own, while each of them managed to get to a point in his life where he/she found his or her strength again.  
Second the humor. While some of the jokes in the series become kind of dull because they get repeated over and over again, some of them become running gags that work absolutely well. Nothing here is taken too seriously which gives Oda and his team many opportunities to surprise with new creative ideas. 
Of course this creativity get's visibly exhausted at some points in the series. It is just too long to be sustained over presumably 1200 episodes that they will produce until we finally know what the One Piece really is in the first place. Many of these episodes especially the fighting scenes are stretching among 50 to 70 episodes while not much happens in each single episode.  
 
From all the long-term animes it is probably the best and definetly surpasses it's competitor Naruto in creativity, humor and especially when it comes to characters. 
If you don't like animes that are completed way too soon, One Piece gives you the opportunity to fall in love with a bunch of characters who will probably accompany you for many years.

    One Piece, the current best selling manga series of all time and in my opinion ""The greatest shonen series to date"". Controversial this statement may be, but here me out, this review is my opinion on the one piece franchise, if you don't agree with me opinion then  feel free to message me explaining why. 
 
Story: 
One Piece's story is overall pretty simple, Monkey D. Luffy (Main Character) wants to become the pirate king, in order to do that he needs to find the One Piece, the greatest treasure known to man that was left behind by the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger. At the beginning of the series Luffy sets out on an adventure to do just that and along the way form a pirate crew with the best members he can possibly find. The story of One Piece, along with the characters are what I believe to be the series strong points and why I think it is the best shonen series. The One Piece world is the biggest, most interesting and immersive world in anime that I can think of, you have desert islands, snow islands, women only islands, no matter where luffy ends up going you are always in for something new, fresh and interesting. That is exactly why One Piece stands above the other series such as Naruto & Bleach, it is always coming up with new ways to interest the viewer and keep them hooked.  
 
Characters: 
One Piece's characters in short, are some of the most developed and interesting characters in anime, every member of luffy's crew has had multiple episodes/chapters of backstory, explaining how they became who they are. This allows them to develop into new, stronger people and you get to watch that happen. Now don't get me wrong, some of the side characters don't get as much development as the straw hat pirates but there are so many characters in one piece that giving them all backstory would be nearly impossible. Another positive to One Piece characters is that each of them has a completely different personality, so there is bound to be a character that you really like and can relate to.  
 
Soundtrack: 
Not much I can really say about the soundtrack other than its pretty amazing, the soundtrack is full of orchestrated songs that will give you goosebumps, each song goes extremely well with whatever is happen. A pumped up song when luffy is fighting, to a calm and chilled song when something sad is about to happen, there is something for everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 
This depends on the viewer, some people don't like the over the top fighting, I however think that's what makes the show fun and its one of my favorite parts about One Piece. Everyone has a different opinion on the show, some hate it, some love it, I think however that everyone can at least appreciate the show for what it is, entertainment.   
 
Overall: 
One Piece is a very well written, very funny and enjoyable shonen series that everyone who watches anime can at least appreciate, if you are thinking about watching or reading the series go ahead, If you make it 50 episodes in you will be hooked. Its the number 1 selling manga of all time for a reason!! :)

    One Piece is The Greatest Shonen Anime/Manga of all time. 
 
It features a grand adventure full of colourful and developed characters, each with their own unique goals and dreams. The narrative is extremely well-paced and intriguing with great writing and presentation; the Animation and Music are both incredibly top-notch. They give each Arc/Location it's own style of atmosphere which makes the series very innovative. This coincides with the genius storytelling that balances badass action scenes and hilarious comedic moments. One Piece is also a very memorable show with gorgeous imagery and designs. An example of this brilliance is in the backstory for the Punk Hazard Arc where a character with a Fire-type ability battles an Ice-type character for a long time in one location, an island. This results in a contrast of settings and characters because half the island is covered in Ice while the other half is engulfed by Fire, so different variations and ideas are explored in just one Arc! 
 
Finally, the series just knows how to have fun and not be overly-dramatic like many other Animes. This in turn, makes the few brilliant dramatic episodes all the more impactful! 
 
One Piece is a True Classic.

    One piece is one of the best anime I have seen. First of all its plot is huge and outstanding. Oda-san has created a whole world for this anime. In addition one piece's soundtracks are epic. Moreover the characters are well-designed. Besides this the voice actors are well-picked and they're doing a great job. Lastly  the main reason I rate one piece as one of the best anime is that it includes many funny moments but it also contains epic fighting scenes, too.

    This is the 3rd anime i watched when i started. 
I found it on a youtube trailer ,with the 4kids dub. 
the art style is great and the story itself isn't that bad are simple i know. 
but does that matter, if its easy too understand. 
 
Now the background story's! 
no spoilers just WOW! 
 
But still the 4kids dub damn what where they thinking? 
leave it by the Pokemon series. they where good. 
But what the hell did those voice actors do when they recorded the voices? 
 
FUNImation the brand that was also on School rumble (first full anime series i've seen) so i thought hey they started dubbing One Piece. why not try streaming 2 eps. 
 
next day i orderd the first two box sets xD 
The humor and action scenes are so well worked out. 
no more lemonade shit when somebody dies, real blood!! 
 
voice overs are the best with colleen clinkenbeard as luffy and  sonny strait as ussop, nami luci christian and offcourse Roa noa Zorro as Chistpher R Sabat. 
 
Amazing!

    This is a positive review. I am going to express my spite for many parts of the show in a brutally honest way, but overall I am arguing that this is a beautifully rare specimen of the world. 
 
The FLAWS of One Piece: 
 
1) It is an epic, and it is dragging us around. It is too long and slow, and they want it that way: to keep us watching for 10 to 15 more years. (I personally think that the series could have had an open-ended finale at the Summit War) 
 
2) It's a Shounen. We are all familiar with the flaws here, some weird race to ""who is the most powerful in the universe"", nonsensical arguments about the rankings of strength, Highlander ""there can only be one"" sentiments, shitty intro music, etc. What really irks me is that this has really gotten worse over time. The first few seasons are actually guilt free these problems. During the Skypiea saga Oda really signs the lease on a Shounen when enemy attacks have DBZ sound effects, and the action scenes are outsourced to fight scene specialists that botch Luffy's facial expressions (which are a highlight for me). 
 
3) It's repetitive: as said in other reviews, every country they visit has more or less the same dilemma: evil ruler, Luffy kicks their ass. Except it takes 100 episodes. Every female character is mostly boobs, supporting characters have weird laughs, Luffy protects his nakama, and anyone who sees Luffy fight believes he will become pirate king, which is meant to keep the drug-addicted super fan on the edge of their seat for another 15 years thinking ""OH MAN IS HE REALLY GONNA DO IT??"" 
 
THE GOOD PARTS OF ONE PIECE THAT MAKE THESE THINGS FORGIVABLE 
 
1) It's really fucking original and creative. On one end, the Shounen aspects seem unoriginal. But I don't think we can overlook the fact that the main character is a happy-go-lucky adopted straw-hat rubber-man, and he is but one of the hundreds of amazingly interesting characters. I haven't seen any other anime that unleashes the author's insane ideas as much as One Piece. In terms of content, this show is definitely one of the most unique I have come across.  
 
2) The dramatic side is actually really interesting. Earlier I mentioned a shift in the show during the Skypiea saga. While I dislike much of the production quality that changed at this time, this saga added an additional layer to the show that I think becomes one of the reasons that keeps us watching. While each individual saga is predictable (mean ruler, Luffy beats them up, nobody dies), the overarching story has multiple levels of intrigue, and the length of the show is actually effectively utilized to create a multi-dimensional story arc. 
 
3) The MOST important: the universe... it's amazing. The characters, the geography, the islands, everything. Since the show is so slow, I almost want to recommend the manga, but truthfully it's fun to see these ideas come to life with color, movement, and sound. While I have mostly talked about suspense, I would here like to say that One Piece is good because it is FUN. Despite the repetition, I think it's amazing to see Oda/Luffy/Roger's idea of what a pirate is: someone who sets sail in search of adventure. With that premise in mind, Oda took aspects of Earth and made them cartoony, dangerous, and exciting for Luffy to encounter throughout his journey. This craving of adventure sets an optimistic tone for the whole series, and while it is often cliche and predictable, that doesn't depreciate from my liking of the Strawhat pirate crew when they are already such a unique hodgepodge of individuals. I truly believe that buried in this crazy story, are Oda's opinions about how people should genuinely treat their human position. 
 
Any hesitance to watch the show due to the fact that its is already almost 800 episodes long is totally valid. But if you are capable of diving into a lengthy series, and are making the decision betweens epic sagas, I think that One Piece is the king (yeahyeah, funny) of this genre.

    Let me say this right now: One Piece will forever be my favorite series. I have faith that Eiichiro Oda will continue to write with the amazing skill that he has and will not let it falter like the writers of Naruto and Bleach did toward the end.  
 
But but BUT there's two big reasons that I say series rather than anime. In truth, I follow the manga far more closely than the anime itself. There are two reasons for this: the filler and the animation budget. As a long time One Piece fan, I'm sure that many of you understand what I'm referring to. But to those who are jumping into the series this late (good luck binge watching that, kids) I shall explain the faults of the anime. 
 
Let's start off with the big one: animation. Now, when I say animation I'm not talking about art style. I think Oda's art style is unique and he delivers it very well. No, I'm referring to the amount  of crappy stills put into a fight scene. The amount of quality that fails as the series progressed. Up until the Whitebeard War arc (which you could say is currently the halfway point of the series) the animation had its own charm. It wasn't overly flashy but it certainly got the job done and both the fight scenes and the relaxed scenes looked fairly decent. But once the New World hit, something happened to the budget of the animation, as many of the scenes lacked a lot of detail and its disheartening to see. Now, recently, the animation has started to hike back up. I don't know how long this will last or if it will be just for these few scenes in between the big climax, but time will tell on that.  
 
Onto the second problem: the filler. Now, unlike Naruto and Bleach, One Piece's filler isn't done through seasons of standalone arcs. There's only a few of those throughout the series and generally don't last that long in the first place. The filler, much like the animation slope, came later in the series, and worked its way in between episodes. What Toei does is instead of making arcs to distance themselves from catching up to the manga or just taking a few months break, they instead will expand on one scene very terribly and ruin the flow that Oda put forward. Something that lasted one or two panels in the manga will last close to ten minutes in the anime. This might not be such a problem if Toei didn't make the expanded scenes so ugly looking or interesting. Instead you can just feel the laziness of the scene. 
 
With those complaints out of the way, lets get into the good stuff: everything else. The story of One Piece is fairly simplistic in nature as its usually just following Luffy and crew from one island to another, usually involving Luffy saving said island from some evil mastermind. Now this might seem like some rinse and repeat idea, but what Oda does to make each arc different is simple: He makes each island have its own genuine feel. In the East Blue arc, all of the islands are generally identical, but there's a reason for that: East Blue is the weakest sea on the planet. Its meant to a more relaxed adventure with more personal problems than outside problems. Once you get to the Grand Line, each island starts to pick up in scale. First big arc is Alabasta, a literal gigantic desert island under the influence of a Warlord. Next is an island in the sky that the crew shoots themselves up to. After that, an island that's' like a giant water utopia, and so on. Each island has its own unique aesthetic as well as a unique set of problems. Each arc feels well crafted and is able to stand on its own two feet in quality.  
 
Next up, the characters. I think this is the biggest thing for a lot of fans because its definitely one of my biggest things about One Piece: I LOVE the main cast. Monkey D. Luffy is a fairly simple character as he's an idiot with a lot of strength and a big dream he's constantly chasing. Sounds pretty familiar, right? Well, Luffy as well as many of the other crew members have plenty of unique things going for them. For one, Luffy isn't a fight crazed protagonist who's constantly seeking a bigger challenge, even if he's constantly picking fights with the big names of the world. Believe it or not, he'd rather go on adventures than fight, even if he does enjoy it to a degree. Not to mention he's aware of his own faults, having assembled a crew that can act in ways that he can't.  
 
Another thing about characters in One Piece is that, somehow some way, Oda does not let any of the named ones go to waste. Somebody who seemed to only have a bit part in the past or seemed insignificant before is very likely to come back up again and have a larger role in the scale of things. The thing about it is, Oda knows how to make even subvillains seem sympathetic if he wants. In the previous arc, a very small time bit villain has a flashback during his fight with one of the crew and it ends up making you feel bad for him. To be honest, I was shocked how much I ended up liking him. His design is so dumb but the design has a reason behind it and you end up thinking 'wow, that's actually cool of him'. Seriously, if anything is the highlight of this series, I'd say its the character moments.  
 
On to the music and sound, the music is pretty on point. It's not the greatest anime OST ever created but it certainly gets the job done. When the series wants you to feel hyped up, its got the track for you. When its got a scene that is sad, you know it's about to play the perfect mood setter. The only complaint I might have about the sound is the eye catchers that pop up when you can tell its switching to commercial. Sometimes those can get annoying and ruin the mood of a scene especially if things are getting intense or sullen. Other than that, the OST is good. 
 
As for the voices, I'd say generally the voices fit each of their roles perfectly. I remember when I first watched One Piece subbed, I thought 'what the hell is up with Luffy's voice??' but as I continued to watch the series, I realized that the VA for Luffy is incredible. Her emotional content and strength of voice is amazing. Not to mention she's actually in her 70's. You have to admire that kind of skill in a VA. When Luffy's going to make a big exclamation, she's right on it. When Luffy's in pain or suffering, she can put that out like nothing. Don't disregard the Japanese VA just because the voice seems childish, she does a fantastic job as Luffy. The same goes for the rest of the crew, but Luffy's VA stands out for me the most. 
 
Well, I believe that about wraps up my review. Overall, while I do prefer the manga to the anime due to the reasons above, there's plenty to love in the anime regardless of that. There's a reason that this series has survived so long and has ruled as the king of Shounen since its arrival. If you don't mind the length and time required to be put in, I highly recommend this series.

    Hahaha... I love one piece. I really do. Found it when the straw hats hit the new world. Watched it from the beginnng like 3 times. I just wish that the show would break for a year so episodes could have more content. Cause with it on the a$$ of the manga. It’s quality is dropping. Dressrosa was the worst arc to get through because it seemed like they were so desperate to slow down they didn’t put anything into any of the episodes. Getting better with the current arc but they really do need to do something. Wether they put the show on hold. Or just add some fillers that would at least have something better than crowds running and a 10min intro

    This is probably one of the greatest shows that I have ever seen. But, this is not a show that you should be considering to watch as one of your first ten anime series. This show should be something that you are wanting to watch because everyone says it's good and you have probably already been watching anime for about a year. I will mention this again ""This is a great show"" but it deserves a huge amount of commitment and your attention. With its current 832 episode marker, you should not treat this as a walk in the park. I was able to start and catch up in about 6 months but, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Take your time. If something catches your eye you can keep watching but it isn't something that I would recommend just to get your episode count up. Again, ""This is a great show"" and if you are just watching it because you have nothing else to watch and you aren't giving you're utmost attention to the show then forget it, it isn't worth your time.  
 
That said I would recommend this show to anyone that likes adventure shows and things like Dragon Ball and Fairy Tail. Also, THIS IS A BIG TIP.  If you have stopped watching One Piece because you don't like the art style, you don't find it interesting, and you are only about 60 episodes in. I can't stress this enough KEEP WATCHING. That is when the show gets good and if you are stopping there then you are missing all of the good parts of the series that come later. There is also something else that I totally recommend doing. Skip from episodes 152-196. This is probably the most boring arc of a series that I have ever watched. It is on par with the Key of the Starry Sky arc from Fairy Tail. If you watch this One Piece arc you are sure to stop the show. It is a guarantee. It is that bad. However, if you are that person who wants to see all of a show because they want to talk to their friends about the series that they have seen all of. I promise you it isn't worth it. Of the 6 months that I mentioned earlier that it took me to catch up one and a half of them were me just watching other things because I was stuck at that arc and I wasn't advancing. I am not saying don't watch it I am just stating that it might be something that you don't necessarily want to watch. 
 
The third and final thing that I am going to mention about One Piece is the opening songs. These opening songs are probably some of the best that there are in shows. All though very rarely do they relate to the plot in the actual visuals, the songs are on point. I have most of them downloaded on Spotify and I can't even tell you how many times I have listened to these songs. They are amazingly good. But I have to warn you. Around the 400 episodes, they have the Toei Animation opening sequence. You might get into a habit of just skipping the whole opening and the recap which is fine but watch out for one thing. While I was watching I got into the habit of skipping the song but I never checked the songs that I was skipping so it turned out that I had skipped two of the openings that I didn't know about. So my advice to you is that you should at least check what you are skipping at least once every 20 episodes. That is really helpful and makes sure that you know about all the openings that are coming up, and you never know you might actually enjoy some of them. 
 
So, in conclusion, you should really consider watching this show and if you don't like it, No big deal but just letting you know there are no other shows like this out there.

    The first time I saw One Piece I was like “Uh, such a bad graphic, I'm going to drop this shit”, but after that I saw a picture of characters evolution and I've started watching OP again 3 months ago. 
 
The story is unique and very attractive, also It's very long but i like how it is. I love how Oda made such a great story called ""The Great Age of Pirates"". Besides this i noticed how nice are combined the fantasy, action and comedy. The story describes a man who want to become ""The Pirate King"". Who hears this will laugh, but Luffy is very serious about this and he wants to make his dream come true. Also Luffy's friends have their dreams too. They want to make their dreams come true, that's why they follow Luffy. Besides this Luffy is a true friends who knows how to transform the enemies in friends. In tine, his friends began to fight for his dream.  
 
The first time i saw the characters i was very disappointed, but after a few episodes I started to love them more and more. The evolution of characters is fucking awesome, they started to be more powerful and more beautiful (the boys are so hot ~ I feel like I am going to die). After 50-100 episodes, the graphic started to change in a better way. Some of the characters have changed significantly. I love the power of the characters and how they're using it. 
 
I really enjoy watching this because it's so hilarious. I laughed so hard at Luffy's imitations and I love how Nami kicks Luffy's, Zoro's and Sanji's ass. ^.^ Usopp is so funny with his 'disseases' like ""Can't-get-on-this-island disease"" and ""I'll-Die-If-I'm-On-My-Own Disease"". Zoro's sense in direction is so bad, I cry laughing every time I watch at his scenes. 
 
In other words this show is so good, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. I have watched many anime series, but One Piece was, is and will be the best anime ever for me and I highly recommend for shounen lovers. I can't stop watching it. So far I give it a 10/10.

    I'm totally in love with One Piece. Years ago, my friend once told me that the top three best anime in the world were Bleach, Naruto and One Piece. Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto, I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece??? I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto. But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day, I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day. Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation. What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. 
Now let's talk about the anime itself: 
 
STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward,a young boy Monkey D. Luffy(17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King,Gol D. Roger.Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates.The series is divided into arcs,each featuring its very own story and setting,each island,each place the straw hat pirates(Luffy and his crew)visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances.And that's one of the best things of OP,you never get bored.You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it.Everything is interesting and everything is fun,Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers.Thats something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly.Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series,especially Luffy,don't really care about their destination,hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all.All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things,get stronger,meet new people and face powerful foes.Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers(episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto,Bleach anyone?).Also the fillers are actually not that bad,sure they are not good but many of them are OK.And thats a huge plus for an anime series. 
 
CHARACTERS:This is where OP really shines.Each character is presented with great detail,they are all quite unique.Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are,why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams.Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other.We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other,they become something very close to a family.That's the kind of bonds they make.Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines.We see why they make the kind of choices they make.Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good.Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause,in their own justice and in their own dreams.  
 
ART AND SOUND:One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation.The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics.The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other(that's a huge plus in anime).The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors,I'm always talking about the original Japanese(don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters.The music,for me at least,is very catchy and actually really well made.However that depends on personal taste,if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it.Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime. 
 
OVERALL ENJOYMENT:One Piece is one of the most,if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find.It really excels in pretty much every field there is.It is the only anime series,or any series,I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me,have I seen a lot).I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure.If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not(oh you will want to continue).Trust me and you won't regret it,just like I did.

    Not a fan but its a decent series. if you wanna see naruto become a stretchy pirate this is for you. a long going series with a bit of character depth very childish nature but has alot of action. its not as good as bleach or naruto itsself but still can be a better watch for you then it was for me. i didnt get far into it but ik it wasnt for me but i can see its a good one for others its some what of a action supernatural war kinda story it has fruits that give power and groups of pirates vs navy while searching for a legendary treasure

    One Piece is overall, a amazing and alluring story. 
 
The story is really well thought of. It has its originality of Devil Fruits, Haki and such. Especially the Pirate Era, the shichibukai system and the 4 emperors of the Grand Line. Though it took inspiration from the anime ""Dragon Ball Z"" an Oda took some real life pirates and turned them into his own, taking bits of them into his characters.  
One Piece, as a long-running anime, was and is a very large piece of hard work. Oda has to keep it exciting with epic fight scenes, cliffhangers (Which I think he's amazing at), and emotional touching scenes. Oda is also really good at foreshadowing, because he has foreshadowed many things from the very beginning of One Piece up to even episode 500+. I do not wish to spoil any of those foreshadowing. 
Back to the subject, Oda makes One Piece successful by keeping the interest flowing (Which he does by the good plot lines of each arc) so that at the end of each anime/manga episode/chapter makes you crave more and more. But that interest will sometimes drop when the fillers come, though some of the fillers are also interesting and hilarious on some occasions. 
The interest also seems to fall rapidly because of the extremely slow pacing in any arc Oda makes.  
Like each big arc (Like East Blue, Alabasta, Sky Island), they all have more than 50 episodes. And 50 episodes is about as long as a year. 
That's why some people don't want to watch One Piece. 
But, if you have the patience to sit down and just watch, I can assure you, there is a very high change you'll enjoy One Piece, a lot.  
 
Art? No, it's not the best. 
At the beginning of One Piece, I have to be honest, the art was pretty bad. But remember this was drawn in the 1990's and they didn't have good technology. The story sometimes can distract you from the art so sometimes when the story gets good, you'll just get dragged into the story deeper and you'll forget everything about the art. 
Thankfully, the art improves greatly as the story progresses. The most noticeable improvement starts about around the Water 7 arc which is about episode 200 or so. By then, the story gets amazing good and you'll start to not care about the art. 
Then, by episode 500, the art is really good. Compared to episode's 1 art to episode 500's, 500 is like the king of pirates while episode 1 is a small frog in a well (Couldn't help but quoting Mihawk there XD). 
It still isn't the best animation but it still earns about a 8/10 by episode 500. 
 
One Piece has a very large variety of sounds that fit the scene super well. From the slurp of noodles to a cymbal clap.  
As for the soundtracks... 10/10, no question. Now I don't know  about you but One Piece has many soundtracks that you could fall in love with and each scene in the anime, Toei Animation knows exactly what soundtrack it goes with and it fits so good, it's like finding the last piece of a puzzle and fitting it in, completing the puzzle. How do they do it? The soundtrack they choose is literally like finding a couple that were meant to be soulmates. The music can go to happy, then immediately go into a emotional melody. 
The openings are the same too. The first opening, ""We Are!"", is super catchy and I just can't help but sing along with it. And I love it when they make ""We Are"" with different voices or recreate it into a different opening. There are a total of 3 ""We Are"" openings. Actually, all of the One Piece openings are catchy and loveable. I also enjoy the narrations in the openings too!  
 
One of the best pros of One Piece is the outstanding character development. Each introduced character has a very unique personality. I don't think any of the introduced characters in One Piece have very similar personalities. That's just my opinion. 
Like Nami, who is pretty mature and takes things serious but then turns into a deceiving mischievous cat when it comes to getting money. Like Zoro, who is very strong but gets lost super easily even when someone is telling him directions. Sanji, who acts cool and is a great cook but loses his cool immediately when he comes across a pretty lady. And Luffy who is a drooling dog when he sees food but can be the most loveable, understanding, mature idiot ever. I don't know but Luffy knows the exact words that people need to hear.  
 
I really enjoyed this anime, as you can tell. My brother started watching One Piece about 4 months before me and it was all I heard him talking about. So, when Winter break started, I decided to start watching One Piece. My brother told me that in the beginning, One Piece was very slow but too me, like him, I fell in love with One Piece on the very very first episode. I actually caught up to episode 700 in a month. That's how good it was for me. Overall, I rate this a proud 11/10.

    One Piece is the greatest story ever told by mankind, a little flawed yet it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.  Thank you Oda, for making my life worth living, I re watched it twice, I still find it so fresh and valuable. I have a tattoo of One Piece on my heart.  From the top notch writing to the unique character designs and development to bad ass quotations to the most iconic moments in Shonen anime history, One Piece has everything what an anime fan has to look for before calling it home.  I live my life following One Piece each and every second.  There's only one thing I'm always worried about One Piece, there's a lot story to be revealed, I want it to continue for more 700-800 episodes (1000 chapters) which would take 15 years, to give importance to each and every unsolved mystery in One Piece, and not to forget the character development, I want the straw hats to look legendary before they get the One Piece.  I'm pretty sure Oda will never disappoint me and million fans who are excited to know more about the greatest story ever witnessed in the history of mankind!

    One Piece is the best anime i ever watched. At first i didnt like it becouse of the art but then i started watching the movies whit my parents and it was great. So we started whatching the anime too.  
The story is excellent a truly masterpiece, the character are really funny and different from everyone. The animation is not very good to begin with, but it is become better afterwards. 
The plots are well-written and hold my attention without taking themselves too seriously and adding unnecessary drama that causes me to lose interest. There is also a good friendship and some touching scenes. 
 
One Piece is an anime about pirates and dreams.. but mostly about dreams.

    If you are Shounen anime lover then u have come to right place my fellow Otaku!! 
One Piece (OP) is the Epic Shounen anime out there...This anime got it all...it's a great anime with the awsome plot,great storyline,hilarious jokes,amusing characters with distinct attitudes,remarkable character development,thrilling adventure and the most important thing is....this anime is one heck of enjoyment...it's not just any action or adventure anime who has few episodes with some unexplained plot to it... 
  It's true that OP is hell of a long anime with lots of episodes to it..but they all worth watching each and every moment of it..because of the deep plot and lots of amazingly explained facts take there sweet time to give us ride of a true anime world!!..I think the best part of the OP is all the chemistry of characters and plot is turns out really great...also the relatively and continue momentum of anime will keeps up hypnotize in the pirate world of One Piece...The X-factor of the OP is the Mystery arises during the storyline...Have great time watching it guyz 😁

    Don't let the odd art style or ridiculous number of episodes deter you from watching this masterpiece.  
There will never be a boring moment.  
You will experience some of the greatest laughs and feels from this series.  
Just when you think you have the characters figured out, they surprise you.  
Oda never forgets a single one of the characters that he creates and neither will you.  
You don't just watch One Piece.  
You live it alongside the crew as they sail on the open seas on their grandiose adventure.

    It is difficult to sum up the story of a series with hundreds of episodes, TV specials and movies, so I'd rather just try to tell you what it is about and why it is so incredibly good. 
 
The series starts off with a guy named Luffy whose ultimate goal it is to become the one and only ""King of all Pirates"" and to find the greatest treasure in the world. The first episodes introduce him and some characters and make a lovely start that is entertaining and makes one want more. On his way Luffy meets a lot of very interesting characters who become his crew members and friends - each of them with an intense and captivating background story. Every character in this series - be it friend or foe - is either adorable, tragic, despicable or interesting at the least... no boring characters anywhere. Later on in the series, important events and story twists are often visualized or supported by huge appearances in the fabulous and unreal environments that our crew travels. This is perfectly done and helps the already epic feel of the story. I have seen 150 episodes, four movies and two specials so far and there were moments that made me cry, laugh, think and re-watch some episodes (especially 85-90) at least 30 times. You might come to the false conclusion of having a kids show here due to the presentation, but that is definitely wrong. People sometimes say about a movie or series that it is ""not a life changer, but entertaining"". That is definitely not the case here! I know it sounds nerdy, but this series has broadened my horizon in many ways and I recommend anyone to take the admittedly long time to get into this epic adventure. The best way to do so will be to watch the fan-subs which are as close to the original as a non Japanese will get (explanations of puns and traditions). There are of course some filler episodes in a huge project like this which won't blow you away, but that is only natural with hundreds of episodes and helps developing the characters.

    ONE PIECE , am gonna talk about one piece in many points ... 1) STORY (10/10): the story in one has no ending , by that i mean that there is a lot of things that happens and need explains and you don't know when are they gonna explain it , a take this as a good thing , because oda has showed us how a big and huge mind he have .... 2) ART (9/10) :  the manga has an amazing art and incredible also , but when you come to the anime am Afraid that it's unstable , i think the reason is because they have a lot of directors in all the episodes , and that gonna make the drawing always changing .. 3) SOUND (10/10) : i don't know what exactly they mean about sound , maybe its the sound track , the sound is incredibly amazing it actually fits the pirates , and also it's diverse ... 4) CHARACTER (10/10) : absolutely the best anime in character kind , there more then 100 hundred amazing characters , and they all not the same , you can find every one different then the other one , for example luffy : he is funny strong and every one loves him , and in the other hand there is doflamingo   : he is very very smart and had a really evil planning and you can't expect what he is doing and he is absolutely very powerful , and that's a divers ... 5) ENJOYMENT (9/10) : the reason that i did not the enjoyment a full score is because of the comedian moments that they put it into an amazing fight , it ruin the the enthusiasm of the battle and it's really not the time ... 6 ) OVERALL (10/10) : of course am going to give one one piece 10 of 10 , this anime is come once in life , big adventures and fighting never end , this anime needs two things , the first thing is the art of the episodes not the manga , it needs more taking care of , the second thing is the long time that they take in one story , they need to hurry up more , cut some of the useless scenes . thank you for reading  my review

    One piece! Seriously a great story! I liked the plot a lot and the character Luffy is just amazing. He gives a very positive impression about how people should live their life - simple, without worries, taking challenges and working hard to achieve the goal. All the characters' behavior is appropriate and suits to them. 
All songs especially the opening ones are so good. I actually downloaded them and I listen to them frequently. And the whole anime is so well made. Each scenery, each island and the sea looks so unique and beautiful. The action is so exciting and the suspense is just thrilling. What will happen next? Who will do what? That's the question I have every time I watch an episode. And I really enjoyed watching it. 
Some drawbacks are the extended fights that just go on for episodes and one gets bored to wait for the fight to finish. There are some fillers which are out of story line and aren't much interesting. One piece is going a bit slow, which I hate the most.  
But, the overall story is great, characters are great and its fun watching it.

    Just finished the Marineford arc and  suppose that I should make a review on what I've watched so far. 
 
The plot actually is quite good, even though carrying the mainstream shounen anime and a little bit straight-forward. As you watch the anime, you can easily tell  that every episode is intriguing ( I don't know if you want to count fillers ). Also, every arc I watched so far does not disappointed me at all, even though some maybe better than the others. And it is also have originality, maybe because its concept that is rare in shounen anime. Just because it left a complexity, I'll rate the story 8. 
 
The art is not so compelling as the story is at the beginning, but as you follow every episode, the art is beginning to improve. Although not as good as the other newer animes, the art is good enough for at least myself. I'll rate the art 7. 
 
The soundtracks, OP and ED are really good and well placed, suitable with the story that is about the pirates and adventures. Guess I'll say nothing more about the sound and rate it 8. 
 
The character development of every Straw Hat crew is quite good, considering the adventure that they had experienced. It's impressive how the adventure had make them more mature and stronger in terms of physical, mental, emotion and their will. I'll rate it 8. 
 
The anime is really, really, really enjoyable. The anime can make you laugh, being amazed and cry at the same time. So, I'll rate the enjoyment 10. 
 
Overall, this anime is one of the best anime that I've watched so far. Why not the best? Because there are some anime that is same level as One Piece. BTW, I'd recommend this for those who loves shounen anime. So, say no more, I'll rate this anime an outstanding 10. 
 
P/S : And for those who says that this anime sucks, open your hearts please. One Piece isn't as bad as you think. Don't be so judgmental just because the art is not so compelling, the episodes are too many or whatever that makes it looks bad to you. Just give it a try.

    This anime is BY far the best anime series out there 500+ episodes will prove that.  If you do not watch this anime or at least some of it then just give up on anime.  This anime will make you laugh until you cry and all of a sudden you will be crying from how emotional it can be.  Also, Nami and Robin are HOT.  Overall this anime is a MUST watch for all people who watch anime on a regular basis.

    What should I say about this Anime? 
Now I'm not one for long running Anime's, always drawn into things like FullMetal Alchemist and Code Geass... but what surprised be about One Piece was the CHARACTERISATION. 
 
You follow the story of a young green-horn pirate called Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to find the One Piece. Leaving his home town on a journey to become Pirate King. Along the way he meets friends who he takes upon his crew where there the story only just begins as trial and error becomes apparent in their every turn. This forms the crew called the Straw Hat Pirates. 
If that short snippit doesn't seem like much, let me explain.  
 
If you're full on personalities of characters, Eiichiro Oda has provided that in One Piece with a DON. No matter what character you meet, even if you hate them or love them, have a backstory so unique to them that you can't ever shake it off. It attaches to you. If something happens to a character, it's never forgotten, if there's a bonding between two characters it instantly becomes apparent through each episode you watch and never breaks.  
You will find yourself having feelings for characters you would believe to be side fluff, but instead you have those tissues out ready to blow your nose. You're not just journeying with the Straw Hat pirates, you're EXPERIENCING and LEARNING with them, you're almost taken on board with what's happening which makes the experience so gratifying.  
 
The negatives is it's a hard series to get into, and I fully suggest if you start watching One Piece, or beginning the Manga, that you STICK WITH IT. If you want to see the juiciness of what this creation is all about this Anime does need a lot of your time and efforts to push through to the engaging episodes. 
When you reach engaging episodes, sometimes there will be some areas where they drag it on way too long and you find yourself frowning at the screen because the same fight has been happening for 5-10 episodes. This IS COMMON EARLY ON, however it becomes less and less in the later series. 
Filler, even though it's few and very far between, is awful. There is a mini series episodes tucked which is dedicated to a few spin off titles of One Piece that are not so bad but the filler... is just filler. There's nothing special about it, although it's understandable why filler happens. 
 
When I started One Piece I had a lot of free time on my hands, it almost became a daily watch for me since I had the time after my studies during University which is why I got so far in such a short time. However, don't let not having any time deceive you from watching this Anime if you are interested because I promise it gets awesome. Real awesome. 
I can't stop watching it any way.  
 
Happy Sailing!

    I cant make a good preview, but this is from mine 
 
Story, from the story its good when a young man wants to become a pirate king and oda sensei write the story from 1997, all the stories were unexpectedly. Like from the start of the stories oda is always giving a clue what will happen in the next episode, or the future episode. the story is good, imagine how can a 17 years old boy sailing in the sea with a small boat from his hometown, and now he got a wanted poster over hundred million.  
 
Art, honestly the art was not very good but not bad too.  
 
Sound, the sounds is good. like a punch, background sound, fighting scene, and the seiyuu they are all making a good sounds. at first i dont know if luffy was roled by a woman :D. because her sound was very deep and yeah its feel like she is a boy :/ 
 
Character, the character was very good i think. luffy is searching ""nakama"" with a passion and he was already thought how much he must get friends to sailing in the sea. His right hand and also vice captain, his navigator, sniper (  even though he is using catapult), chef, doctor, archaeologist, carpenter, musician, he is finding a different friends to making his ship better and better. 
 
Enjoyment, i am really enjoy this and starting imagine how if i had a devil fruit too, or haki? aaahh that makes me crazy :D 
 
Overall, overall one piece is very good and i highly recommend to watch it. even the manga and anime is within 20 episodes, but i still waiting the anime ( even though i knew the story ) 
 
So, that are from me. good bye have a nice day

    This is a spoiler-free review which covers 759 episodes of the show. 
One Piece is a series that needs no introduction at this point, it is well known for many things both good and bad. I will try to bring a new viewpoint to the table, so bear with me. 
 
I have been stuck watching the show since 2011 and I would describe my experience with the first 500 episodes or so as a beautiful journey. I would recommend it to any shounen loving anime fan. However the quality drops rather significantly after those five hundred. We get some of the laziest animations I’ve ever seen, uninspiring fillers, unnecessary recaps and ‘Reaction Faces, The Anime’. These are complaints you have most likely heard before, especially the recap one. One Piece is now often compared to a bag of chips, that is 60% bagged air and 40% actual content. But why do we still watch it? 
 
I myself couldn’t drop this series, so one day I sat down and tried to watch an episode to evaluate it objectively with nothing obscuring my view. And the answer came to me much sooner than I’d expected, right after the opening song stopped playing. Those of you familiar with the show already know what comes next, which is two sections of recaps, both told by a Narrator. First one about our protagonist and the second one about several previous episodes. While most One Piece fans don’t particularly fancy this part because it takes up to 4 minutes out of the show, I have never once in my life seen a person who would actually dislike the Narrator himself. It’s the opposite, we love the guy. His voice is enjoyable and relaxing and connects us to our childhoods, right? We can have nothing but respect towards this person. Which got me thinking, what exactly is my relationship with Narrator-san? I sit there alone in my room in front of the screen with the curtains drawn and have his silky voice fill my ears with unwanted information time and time again, an experience that can only be referred to as torture, and yet I cannot bring myself to hate Narrator-sensei. This sadomasochistic relationship is now lasting for over five years and there is no way I can deny or escape it. 
 
So why do we still watch this show? The answer is rather simple. Because Narrator-sama is S, and we are M, he is dominating us and we secretly like it. 
 
P.S.: Adding to already existing problems, the pacing becomes near unbearable during Dressrosa arc. I would like to say that it gets better later, but it doesn't. So here is my final piece of wisdom: do yourself a favor and put the playback speed at x1,50 or search for One Pace project online.

    The manga is a 10 for me. The anime could have been something better but no, Toei just had to ruin it with that pacing. The pacing issue causes the anime to deviate from the source in small but significant manner. And I can't believe people still defend it saying things like ""Hey the animation quality is good now so its fine"", ""The dragging on is better because it adds to the enjoyment"" or ""they have to do this as it will catch on with the manga"". That's utter BS. One piece is not the only anime that has the problem of catching up to the source material but no other anime adapts HALF A CHAPTER of the manga in ONE EPISODE. 
 
This is nothing but a massive disappointment. You can watch the anime until it starts dragging on in the return to sabaody arc, but from that point either switch to manga or you can find fan made edits of the episodes which are made as faithful to the manga as possible

    At the start of the anime it seems pretty lit at the start he's just all rubbery and he's just like ""lol i'm rubber haha"" and he hits people n stuff haha. It seems to drop off a bit for me since the super powers get a lil far fetch'd n stuff so it's like a bit stupid when he just shouts something and wins just cause hes rubber like I get rubber is strong n all that but it's a lil stupid ya get me?  
 
Idk I liked it for a while and it had its moments but I feel like it can't make the LONG HAUL work very well and just isn't great for new viewers since ITS SO LONG like who has the motivation??

    Don't hate it, but dropped it around Fishman Island due to decrease in production quality. Continued after that in manga only. This is my choice of the old ""big four"" and the only one that is still ongoing (apart from the restarted DB). 
 
I highly suggest One Piece even as an anime even though it has horrible amounts and many kinds of filler stuck with it. Some moments of the story are delivered with just that much punch that it's worth it. The animation quality decreases drastically after the time skip, so be wary. The time skip also kinda splits the story in two halves.  
 
Join me, millions of others and Luffy as he gathers his crew, captures everyone's hearts and seeks out to be the one true king of the seas. Your efforts will be paid off.

    One piece is an amazing series with great story, art, pacing, and characters... IF i was talking about the manga the anime has many issues most that come later in it that earlier. And i'm not just talking about filler the anime if full of animation issues(that comes later most of it starts around and after the time skip) and pacing issues. If you want to enjoy one piece to the fullest read the manga and maybe go back to some episodes that hold your favorite moments in the manga this is what I've done since i dropped the anime and started reading the manga at the suggestion of a friend. One piece is a great and compelling series but just like many things the adaptation falls short (but only after a certain point the beginning is still pretty good.) so please read the manga.

    One Piece .... My favorite Anime of all time. Here in this review let me tell you why.  
 
Firstly One Piece might look like your typical kind of Shonen but no! One Piece is very unique in many ways like a character's laughter, different kind of race/type of people in the OP Universe, how characters from an episode are link to future episodes or having a background which connects to the past. Oda-sensei(The Mangaka) doesn't ""throw away"" characters he made even though its a minor role. These minor role characters will be appearing or being thought of again in the series. Oda-sensei is just that good in character development! Almost every episode of One Piece is important and if you miss 1 or 2 episodes, you are actually missing quite a lot. One Piece is an Anime which you must never underestimate it because if you were to sit down and really think about it, One Piece is actually a very very deep series.  
 
Story Rating: 9/10 
 
Character's art and animation ... Well, the earlier episodes of One Piece definitely looks old and of course not HD(But I think there's a remake of the earlier episodes? Which was made in HD). But that doesn't matter. As you watch on, the art gets better and better. Not really something to be bothered with. As for the animation, sometimes it is quite bad but usually happens in those unimportant scenes.  
 
Art/Animation Rating: 8/10  
 
For the Sound, its good which I'll rate it 9/10.  
 
So in overall, such a long Anime definitely might get boring at certain parts due to history talking or draggy scenes but fret not, those are still important because almost everything in One Piece are linked.  
 
Overall Rating: 8.7/10

    One Piece is a pirate story centered around the Strawhat Pirates and their captain Monkey D. Luffy 
 
Story: The story is a fairly simple one yet amusing. A boy wished to be the Pirate king and step on the footprints of the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger, How will he accomplish his goal? By finidng the mythical teasure left from the former pirate king, the treasures name? One Piece. The quest starts w/ Luffy trying to recruit members for his crew and making his dream come true. His crew though has dreams too which can be accomplished by following the crazy meat-eater Luffy. Ahoy maety, time to set sail. Did I mention that Luffy has eaten the Gomu-Gomu no Mi which gave Luffy the abillity to stretch himself like rubber? What awaits as in the this Pirate world is a mystery yet to see it unfold to it's fullest. 8/10 
 
Art: The animation is this anime is rather dull in the 1st part and get more joyful later on. It's nothing to be amazed at, but it doesn't let you down, We colorful setting and stuff and fanservice for both gentlemen and ladies. I'll say just two sentences for this and end this here. 1st part We get a flat chested Nami and on second part we get a BIG chested Nami. For our ladies? All males have a pretty muscular body which sometimes makes me wonder why I'm not like that. 6/10 
 
Sound: The sound in this anime is quite good and relaxing or intense depending on the  situtation. One Piece has usually good OPs and EDs but not to go crazy about which is kinda dissapointing for such a legendary anime. The OST can make you grow some feelings be it anger, laugh or being on the verge. 7/10 
 
Enjoyment: If you like shounen type anime this is definitelly for you since it's fully action packed and has everything a shounen fan loves. The bad thing isn One Piece though is that the recpas are pretty damn annoying in he latest episoded cause they happen on each and every episode, that's riiight! In every ep you can and almost full recap, IDK what TOEI Animation thinks of it's viewers, but we are not so short on memory ppl, we are not goldfishes. All in all though and pretty enjoying anime worth the time. 7/10 
 
So overal I give One Piece and 8/10 cause of the beautifull and ragefull moments it gave me which I actually treasure. 
 
Hope this helps you.

    When I first embarked on the journey of One Piece I honestly did not know what to expect. After catching up with Naruto and found myself perusing different anime trying to find something similar to Naruto. After watching a few rather short series, I was intrigued by One Piece but quickly became dissuaded as the episode count was around 400+ at this point. Well I decided to wait till I had free time to watch it. Fast forward a couple of months. It's the summer break, I'm bored at home one day and decide to give One Piece a go. I'll admit that while the first couple of episodes were enjoyable, I could tell that I was not truly hooked on the series. The art style was rather strange, a lot of characters had disproportionately large feet compared to their bodies. The animation in the beginning is also not that great as this is an old series(however both the art style and animation improve over time). The episode that threw all doubt about this series was the Baratie Arc. In the early East Blue saga, Baratie is my favorite arc for a numerous amount of reasons. The themes touched upon during that arc spoke of the power of will, ambition, and dreams. This is was the moment I knew I was in it for the long haul. 
 One Piece is still continuing with the end still quite a distance away. This anime while containing basic shounen elements, such as a not too bright protagonist with a goal and having friendship be a key aspect, is able to contain a lovable quirky main cast, most of which are not one dimensional characters, a vast and unique world which is brimming with adventure, and a milieu of interesting characters and plots contained within it. My favorite aspect of One Piece is the adventure and exploration, the mangaka Eiichiro Oda was definitely successful in creating an interesting and vibrant world, and the anime for the most part conveys it well. 
The animation quality is the biggest complaint I have with this anime. For a majority of the series the animation quality is actually pretty good,it started off poor but steadily improved. After the Skypiea arc the improvement is significant. The quality lasts like this until the Marineford Arc, after which it devolves. Currently, due to almost catching up with the manga in terms of content, coupled with the poor animation quality by Toei has made the One Piece anime drop in quality, which is a shame because One Piece has a sacred spot in my top 5 manga.

    One Piece based on the manga by Eiichiro Oda has been airing since 1999. During its currently 17 years on TV the series has managed to attract a lot of attention and not few will call it one of the greatest shounen series that were ever made.  
 
Story: 
 
Off all the shounen anime series I have watched One Piece (OP) has one of the most interesting main stories. There is Gol D. Roger's notorious treasure One Piece, whose discovery makes the finder Pirate King, and Luffy, in pursuit of it. 
I guess I don't need to say much more about this since it can be considered common knowledge in the anime world.  
Furthermore, OP also offers other interesting stories which will keep the viewers glued to the screen, e. g. Sanji's ""All Blue"" and Nico Robin's ""Hieroglyphs"". In fact all main characters have their goals they pursue, while assisting Luffy. Nothing out of the ordinary, though, since it's quite usual for shounen anime. 
So far for the main storyline. However, when it comes to the other, normal adventures the Strawhats go through, OP lacks much. A usual arc has terrible pacing with many episodes were literally nothing happens (imagine members of the crew running to a certain place of importance, packed into nearly 25 minutes). Arcs are pretty much endless fightings until Luffy takes care of the main villain. This can make it very difficult to watch OP, for arcs often take longer than a year to finish (and some, like the recently finished one, even two). In fact, OP can sometimes feel like an ordeal. But ultimately, once arcs near its end  
 
Art: 
 
OP's animation style can be described best as happy, joyful... and childish. Absolutely everything in it looks amusing and you get the feeling the series is constantly laughing at itself. Being animated that way often ruins the mood in serious moments, however, even in those OP tries to stay funny anyway, so it doesn't really matter and over time one gets used to it. Honestly, I could not imagine One Piece to be animated differently. 
 
Sound: 
 
The soundtrack really is nothing special; it contains some catch tunes that fit the OP universe and highlight the battle scenes. I assume especially Luffy's tune when he's ready for combat is a classic already.  
 
Characters: 
 
OP has a huge cast of characters, beginning with the Strawhat crew, who you just have to like. I'm not going into detail here since it can be considered common knowledge. However, one thing I want to point out is the two females, who often play no role whatsoever and mainly seem to be there to seldom assist in some battles, or for fanservice, highlighted by their hilariously big breast, something which is by the way very normal in the anime actually. 
Apart from the Strawhats, you have a hole bunch of other characters and nakama, many of them funny and annoying at the same time (OP manages to do that). Well, it's the usual shounen anime characters where dealing with. As I like shounen, I find most of them enjoyable. 
 
Enjoyment and overall: 
 
Long-running arcs and mostly terrible pacing throughout the series, and furthermore the typical OP childishness are flies in the ointment, but nevermind all those because it's OP, and somehow there's always something enjoyable about it; maybe it's the weekly shounen madness, waiting for Luffy to go to action, the excitement when an arc ends and a new one starts, long story short, One Piece is, even after more than 700 episodes, still a great series for fans of easygoing fighting anime. And those who breathe shounen will love it anyway.

    One Piece is a different sort of beast than other shows. I'd undeniably recommend anyone to watch it, but the issue lies in that in order to really get a feel for how good the series can be. In my opinion the series isn't very good until the Baratie arc that starts at episode 19, and only really begins to show how good it can be at the Arlong arc at episode 31.  
 
That isn't to say the early episodes are god awful or anything. But if I was only rating the series based on the earliest episode I'd probably saddle it with a 6.5 (fine, but not good).  
 
So the thing about One Piece is that it does require investment. But after those 19 or 30 episodes, the payoff is enormous. There is nearly 700 more episodes of a great anime with limited filler. One Piece just really checks all the boxes for me: it can be funny, can bring you to tears, and can be undeniably badass.  
 
As I have been reviewing shows more and more, I've noticed that one of the aspects that leads to me to rate shows more highly is the world they take plae in. In plenty of great shows, you have a set world and you are exploring the characters story within that world, but One Piece leaves you exploring the world along with Luffy, as his story progresses. There is so many mysteries yet to be solved in One Piece, and discovering more and more about it is part of what makes One Piece so grand.  
 
The characters are also done pretty well. The dynamic of the crew really represents an all for one, one for all type mentality. A lot of dramatic events happen throughout the show, and watching people come together through those hardships is endearing.  
 
Really the only reason that this is not a 10 for me is that I reserve my 10's for shows I consider true masterpieces, that can't be improved (I only have two 10's). And for as great as OP is, it does have it's issues. It starts pretty slow and it's pacing could be better (if you are watching week to week, this gets pretty frustrating. As a binge it isn't as big of a deal though). Also, the art is meh. I do kind of like how unique it is and it does get better as the show progresses, but this can't really touch some other great shows when it comes to the art. Although it is done much better than other shonens and not as prevalent, there is some filler. Even though the filler arcs aren't bad the core series is definitely much better.  
 
So, quick summary. Slow starter (give it at least 20 episodes), but fantastic plot and interesting world to explore and learn more about as you are watching the series. Humor is Good. Drama and the feels can be spectacular in big moments. The action and fight scenes are good. Watch One Piece!

    I really took me a while to start watching One Piece, I was too lazy for is a very long anime !! But something inside me stirred up the desire to sail the seas of One Piece. If you are thinking how I was, take a chance to One Piece, I believe you will certainly want to embark with Monkey D. Luffy in the most incredible adventures the Grand Line to search for the legendary treasure One Piece. 
But first, Luffy looking for a crew, and you will be enchanted with each new member. From beginning we are introduced to each of them, their life stories and especially their dreams. It is interesting how the dreams of each connect in a peculiar way to Luffy, causing them to unite on an incredible journey. Gradually the gang is being formed and coming together like a puzzle. 
And speaking in the troop, I admire the way in One Peice explore friendship and companionship. More than how members of a family, each fighting the other, they take their pain, give the blood to protect his companion as hard as it may seem the battle. As captain, Luffy is what more worries about your nakamas! 
The straw hat gang face harsh battles along the journey. Many ruthless enemies crossing your way some of them stand out for me as Arlong, Crocodile, Enel and of course the World Government are the most terrible so far. 
Of course, not everything is made of hard battles! One Piece always finds a way to start a good laugh, often starring Luffy, Usopp and Chopper, who do mischief on the ship during the trips. While all is quiet and its nakamas are fine, Luffy not worry about anything except food! What many times does look like he is not captain. 
One Piece also take many tears of our hearts! Some of our gang have stories really suffered as Nami and Robin. But as I said Luffy always take the pain of your friends and fight for them to the end. 
One Piece has a wonderful soundtrack, to remember the older animes. Art can seem strange at first, but you get used quickly. However, if you like adventure, laughter, emotions and the power of friendship I'm sure you will love One Piece!

    One Piece is excellent in every single way. The characters are deep and interesting, the world feels really alive and fleshed out, and Oda really knows how to pace arcs correctly.  
Sadly, the anime adaptations goes from good to great to amazing to ok to absolute clusterfuck. It's a really depressing case of unending anime series syndrome. I remember watching this about 7 years ago when there were about 400 epipsodes, and you could mostly skip all the filler arcs and end up with a kind of sluggish but overall enjoyable series, but later arcs, I believe starting at about episode 430-ish, have a lot more filler INSIDE the actual adaptation arcs, which makes it that much more difficult to get around. I've also seen some of the newer fights, and they were really disappointing. The animation was really bad compared to the better arcs (Enies Lobby, Thriller Bark and Shabaody Archipielago). 
My recommendation for watching One Piece is: look for a guide that says which episodes are filler, and try to skip as much of it as possible. If it ever becomes unbearable, switch to the manga. 
Personally, as soon as I caught up with the anime, I started reading the manga. I still read it to this day and it's on my top 3 manga list, alongside FMA and Magi.

    The One Piece is a really in enjoyable anime! Its about Monkey D. Luffy and his straw hat pirates as they currently adventure through the New World. The Story is Awesome, my only problem with the story is the filler in the anime. From Episodes 1-206 I give the art about a 6/10, but starting with Episode 207 the art really improves as starting with this episode, the anime was in HD. The Sound and Music are good and the Voice acting is good nothing bad there. For the main I love there character! Luffy is dense but in situations he really is smart! Zoro is Bad-Ass even when he sleeps and its funny when he gets lost! And every other straw hats character are awesome to! The anime very funny and comedic, and the fights are awesome. I would have my favorite is the Enies Lobby Arc because I like how it told Robin's backstory and the fights through they show that all of the characters are useful unlike DBZ where Goku gets most of the spot light. Overall i'd give the One Piece anime a 9/10 or 10/10.

    Before I begin my review, I would like to tell you that I will be completely honest about what I like about One Piece and what I don't. I'm not a fanboy, and I've been a HUGE fan of Naruto/Naruto Shippuden for over 8 years prior to starting One Piece. Few other long running anime I've watched and loved, Hunter X Hunter, Gintama, Detective Conan, Dragon Ball Z. (I've watched/read all of Fairy Tail, loved it then started hating it, just like many others). I say this so that when I say One Piece is my absolute favorite among shonen anime, you will understand how much I actually love One Piece. I started One Piece a little over a year ago and it has quickly become my favorite. I have never regretted starting One Piece..except for the fact that I'm kind of obsessed with it now. Lol. 
 
P.S: Ignore any typos. And grab some snacks because it's a very long review. 
 
My review will be quite long (too many good things about One Piece) but I will include a shorter/summary version at the bottom if you don't have time. But I suggest you go through it all :) 
 
Let me start with the negatives, which is only one and is only concerned with the Anime. 
 
Negatives: The Anime has terrible/painful pacing, especially during the Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Punk Hazard, Dressrosa arcs. This however, is exlusive to the Anime version and can be overcome by skipping through episodes, skipping fillers (if you wish), etc. So it's not too much of a concern. You'll just have the trouble of waiting for at least a week just to get an episode that cover one or less than one chapter (which is quite less). 
 
Now coming to the pros. There are a LOT of amazing things about One Piece. 
 
Plot (10/10): The plot of One Piece is the single largest plot of any popular anime that has come out thus far. I say this with confidence as other long running series like Detective Conan, Hajime no Ippo (which are very good themselves) have a narrower plot. One Piece has phenomenal world building. Without spoiling too much, it occurs in it's own UNIVERSE and time. In terms of the vastness of the setting, only Dragon Ball Z comes close. 
 
There's several hundreds of different/unique powers. Most of these powers (including that of the protagonist) are completely fresh/never before seen anywhere, not just in anime. (And no, it's not just Devil Fruits) 
 
The plot intensifies exponentially and increases in complexity as it progresses. The first 100 episodes, it's just the pirate Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist, and a his first few crew mates sailing to find the One Piece, a legendary treasure that has been left at the last island of a harsh, destructive Ocean called the Grand Line. But soon we realize a lot more. In the next 100 episodes we learn more about the ACTUAL plot. By the 200s, we have a very well established plot line, but it still grows. In the following 100-200 episodes we learn much more..and so on. By the first 400 or so episodes, the setup is done and everything that follows is just pure awsomeness. With every passing arc, the story gets better and better. However, there is on not-so-important arc which is mostly for comedy which I personally loved (like almost every other One Piece fan, so you probably will too) 
 
People often complain about how long One Piece is, but let me tell you this, that's how big and vast the plot is. It REQUIRES time.  You will have to be patient. Everything that happens in One Piece happens for a good reason, but it does take time. So be patient and try to watch as many episodes as possible. You can binge watch it and finish it in 3-months (Like I did) (as of 28th March, 2016) or watch it slowly over the course of a year.  
 
The plot is always, ALWAYS filled with mysteries. Some answered soon, some so EPIC that we can only learn of them when the series reaches it's end. This is one of the things that keeps me going. 
 
It always has comedy. Many many epic moments and even more to come (it'll be obvious once you catch up to either the Anime or the Manga). Honestly, I've been a One Piece fan for very little over a year now but I don't see myself disliking it ever. I have more than enough confidence in Eiichiro Oda's story writing that was built through 734 episodes and 820 chapter (and still counting). I was never disappointed with any aspect of the plot of One Piece (Except maybe one, but that's completely insignificant). One Piece has many great/amazing/epic fights. However, let me warn you, there's many mediocre/decent to good fights as well. I would recommend Dragon Ball Z, Hunter x Hunter, or Naruto for fights. The fights in One Piece are are not as good as in these but are still very good and enjoyable so no worries here.  
 
Even if everything else (art, sound, fights) were terrible, (which obviously is not the case. It's the exact opposite) the plot alone is worth a 10/10 overall. Trust me. There's a 90%+ chance that you will feel the same. 
 
If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into this. 
 
Also, contradictory to what some might say, One Piece is not repetitive. There is always a reason for why something happens and its almost always different. So be prepared for an exciting, adventurous, enjoyable, funny, action packed, suspenseful story...I mean epic. That's right, One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. 
------------------ 
 
Characters (10/10): One Piece is filled with several amazing characters whom you will love and several others whom you will hate (amazing evil-minded, hateful villains).  
Shanks, an amazing character introduced early on, has in fact inspired the creation of a very popular character in another series! Gildarts from Fairy Tail. 
 
There's a vast variety of personalities you will find in One Piece.  and many important characters have great character development. Both the antagonists and the protagonists have great moments and undergo proper development. 
--------------------- 
 
Animation (7/10): The animation of One Piece is not good. However, epic moments, epic fight scenes, etc. are almost always very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie level animation! If you don't believe it, watch it! (Full of spoilers though, obviously) The animation is great when required. Other times, it's quite still and stocky. But this shouldn't be much of a concern either as the important parts are seldom badly animated. The series goes HD somewhere near the early 200s because it started in 1997 so don't judge it too soon :P 
 
You can look up Naotoshi Shida scenes in One Piece. He is a very famous animator and has created several beautifully animated scenes for One Piece.  
----------------------- 
 
Art (9/10): You must've heard, One Piece has a very unique art style. It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD 
 
The backgrounds are always amazing and full of detail. There are thousands gorgeous shots/panels. 
--------------------- 
 
Sound (9/10): The One Piece soundtrack is also one of my favorites. The background scores fit the situations perfectly. Suspense building, action, adventurous, uplifting, you name it. There's tracks for all this. It's heavily orchestral. I often find myself listening to the soundtracks as they are quite epic.  
---------------------- 
 
So yeah, that's it. Overall, One Piece is superb, excellent, amazing, awesome, etc. Few downs here and there but those are very insignificant in comparison. 
 
--------------------- 
 
 
SHORT VERSION 
 
The plot of One Piece is absolutely amazing. It grows in complexity as it progresses and is always filled with intriguing mysteries. The main plot line is more than just finding treasure and becoming the Pirate King. It's unbelievably huge. One Piece has a vast setting and amazing world building with epic, unique powers that were never heard of before. There's always comedy, adventure, action, mystery, and fun in One Piece. 
 
Due to it's vastness and complexity, One Piece is very very long. However, ignoring the bad pacing of the Anime (only) it is never boring. 
 If you feel like an episode is being dragged, forward it, or skip through a few stretched parts (Like 30 seconds of smoke, 5 minute stare-downs, 6 minutes of recap, etc.) The slow pacing can be easily overcome. 
 
Everything in One Piece happens for a reason, and it is seldom repetitive (contradictory to what a few others say). Has many great fights that are often very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie-level animation. But fights aren't it's strong point (though they are epic). 
 
If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into deaths. 
 
Amazing variety in characters. There are characters whom you will absolutely love, and others, like villains, whom you will hate (in the good way. Evil villain = more hate). And there's villains who are badass as well. Many intriguing personalities and backstories. Great character development 
 
Art style is unique and character designs are almost always amazing.  It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD 
 
Has very good soundtracks that capture the moment perfectly. 
 
One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. 
----------------------------------- 
 
One Piece has quickly grown to be my favorite shonen anime. I hope you enjoy One Piece and one day we could probably spend hours and hours just talking about it.  
 
Patience is key when watching One Piece. But you will most probably get hooked to it pretty soon. But make sure you have time.

    This is the few anime I have decided to not rush through the story plot and slowly watch the journey. As I know there is not ending anytime soon.  
 
After looking through the first few episodes, I believe it has already caught my attention. I believe it has a great story. It has deep meaning. At the start, the boy was panicking about not succeeding. However, Luffy knocked on his head and said the possibility doesn't matter, but he wanted to be pirate king cos he wanted to. Friendship is also emphasized.  
 
After reading reviews, this story seems to be able to reflect on life. I'll look forward to reading this story and savor its essence.

    One Piece! This anime is definitely aimed more towards kids but in a way that even a 30 year old man will like for sure.Why? you ask. For one because it is filled with happy characters and you get a happy feel to it. Also because it is filled with awesome action and pirates. I will guarantee that even if you think it looks horrible in the beginning(which i did) you will like it after you keep watching. 
 
Art-(8) The art is very unique for its time and is not all that good in the beginning considering the time the anime started, but it gets a 100x if not 1000x better after you keep watching. 
 
Characters-(9) All the main characters have different personalities and backgrounds and all give a really nice happy up-feel feeling. 
 
Story-(10) I rate the story of an anime by how unique it is and the enjoyment of it, and this anime is extremely unique and enjoyable and you will not find another anime with such a good unique idea for the story. 
 
This anime is the kind of anime that when you have a bad morning and have a bad day for the rest of the day you will be able to keep going because you will have the feeling of looking forward to at least one thing and that will be going home after everything bad happens to you all day and watching this anime. 
If you have the time to watch an anime with 500+ episodes watch this one. 
 
Hope my review helped you guys. Thanks

    I keep hearing good, bad, and mixed reviews about this series.  I've watched a few episodes sporadically over the many years it's been out...and let's be real here:  It's interesting, but gets old quick, just like DBGT did. 
 
Being a bias anime lover, I give everything a chance and pay close attention to the story line.  If I had to put this anime into genre, I'd go with Comedy and Adult Humor.  Why Adult Humor?  Seriously...do ANY of you pay attention to the various hidden puns? 
 
Moving On. 
I intend to complete this series before the year is up, but based on everything I have seen, read and heard...My score will remain solid :-)

    One Piece 
One Piece is different from other long running shounen series because while other series degraded in quality towards their end One Piece even though has a episode count of 756 hasnt  even a bit in infact it just keeps on getting better 
Story- The strong points of One piece is its story on the surface its basically of Luffy wanting to become the pirate king  but if you actually watch it then the richness of the story will come out  each island in one piece has its own story each arc is important in one piece while after the time skip the pacing has kinda slowed down specially during dressrosa but One Piece is best watched while Marathoning the series. 
Characters- Like islands each character is important in the overall story of one piece not only the Sh but marines the younkou the worst generation. 
Luffy- He sometimes comes out like another of those shounen cliche heroes but he never lets his crewmates or anyone he cares about  be in danger and manytimes while other pirate captains wouldn't give a damn about the island internal conflicts Luffy will always guarantee that he will beat the main villains ass 
Villians- Now the villains of One piece are like no other each have a reason why they became evil and many times you sympathise with them giving them a whole other dimension which is almost absent in other shonen series 
Art- Now this is controversial post timeskip yes the art has been iffy but that occurs only sometimes the art while not the best i think is still watchable and sometimes episodes are brilliantly animated too  
So overall One piece i think if you watch it you will fall in love it and will look forward to sundays

    I'm not gonna bother with a proper review, you can look through the pages and judge for yourself. 
All I'm gonna say is that before you judge One Piece, see the Japanese Subbed version or at least the Funimation Dub, don't bother with 4Kids unless you want to laugh at it. Everyone will tell you this, so don't do it if it's your first time watching One Piece. 
Also, don't expect One Piece to follow the original plot. Just don't, it won't happen anytime soon.

    The hundred-and-so episodes where Brook's character is introduced. That's why I'm not giving this a 9 or a 10. I hated those episodes with a passion. Everything else? Spectacular.

    I watched some of this when I was younger on cartoon network or something and I'd always disliked it. Now I can see the humor and I can never find pirate anime or manga. I adore pirates and the way One Piece portrays pirates is fun. They have the bad, the plan evil, but most of all it has friendships with in the crew. I think it's very enjoyable even if the art is, well down right bad is what I use to think. However now I can see that it's a kind of unique way to show the characters. Besides I've seen worse.

    This is my favorite show. Say what you want about the pacing and filler arcs that sometimes don't follow the cannon of certain characters by ignoring all that I can honestly say this is the one that tops them all in the current era and there's a reason it's been around for about two whole decades now. Because One Piece is amazing. It takes dreams (a concept that most people grow up to give up on and/or believe are only for kids) and makes you want to give life your best shot to achieve your own. Every main character has a dream and are driven beyond belief to achieve their dreams. The best thing about it is that the characters don't just say ""Hey I'm not going to give up on my dreams no matter what happens!"". They realize that the world they live in is a harsh and dangerous place that won't let anyone realize their dreams unless they go through the trials of life. Kind of like real life. The main characters go through struggles all their lives and sooner or later have to decide if they are going to let the world push them to the curve or stand up and fight for what they want. One Piece is a series that can speak to everyone if they watch and listen hard enough to what is really happening and what the creator of this magnificent show is trying to say. Is this show perfect? Of course not. Every show has flaws just like every person in real life has flaws and One Piece is no exception. However if you are willing to set sail with the Straw Hat Pirates and decide that you want to stick with it until the end rather it be a fairy tail ending or something along the lines of a Greek Tragedy or even something that is bitter sweet, then you're in for the adventure of a life time and all the great and unifying moments along the way.

    Some people hate One Piece I'm just here like why, what's to hate, this seires is an adventurous action packed series that sends you on a rollercoaster with your emotions yes it's long but hey that's the good part you can marathon the heck out of it and just chill plus give the author credit he is probably one of the few mangakaa out there that can manage over a 500 characters not sure if One Piece has over 500 characters but I saw online it has the most characters in jump magazine anyway I love this series I love how the arcs are set up the anime tends to drag it out sometimes, the drop in animation quality is likely due to the amount of episodes an arc has some arcs are short example the old One Piece usually had 25-45 episodes but after the timeskip the episodes for one arc is like 100+ which kills their budget that's why sometimes the animation quality looks like dog shit 😂, the characters are one of the main aspects of One Piece their quriky selves and how Loveable they can be this series is greater than most airing seires if people gave it a chance they'd see that what new animes/mangas are doing this series has already done it in a different way

    One piece is my favorite manga. Probably the one I've been for the longest time. I started animated when I was a kid, I was 9 years old. I was watching with my mother and sister, we were having a good time, until I was 11~12 years old. 
 
I stopped the anime for a year or two, and continued it until episodes 700 where I read the manga. Well, no big differences, but I liked reading manga. Then I wanted to continue following the animated despite everything, but.... I was bored. 
 
I stopped following the anime, but looked at it again later and once the nostalgia was set aside, the animated adaptation was an insult to the manga. I recognize that Oda has the ability to stretch some bows / pass through the manga, except that unlike the Toei he does it well. 
So yes, the Japanese dubbing is good, the ost too, there are very well adapted scenes, especially the moving scenes. But the animation, the slowness of the episodes, it kills One Piece. Toei, how can you adapt a 14-page chapter in 20 minutes? It's impossible without stretching as unnecessarily as you do. Who would it kill to make One Piece an animated in season, like all those currently out there? Who would spit on waiting to have a better adaptation than the current one? No one! No one! 
 
So to sum up, the main flaw of the One Piece animation is its awful slowness, the animation.... Worse than average.... In fact, it's basically the manga with more squares for the same shot, to which we add sound and voice. 
That's the principle of an animate, it's true, but this time it's not done right. 
 
The Wa no series is better, but let's not hide our faces except for a big change of style and an improvement of the animation, there is always this frightening slowness that is omnipresent. It's a little higher than the average, but it doesn't save everything. To be exact, I gave up when Urashima and Luffy gave each other their one-minute palm punch. 
 
Par contre les 914 et 915 ils étaient bien

    Adapted from One Piece manga and heavy intervention from Oda in making this anime, even the music as well, this make One Piece become very enjoyable anime to watch 
 
Story: 8/10 
I would say, my rate of story differs in different arcs. Most of relevant stories deserve 10/10 because of their amazing storyline, however, some arcs can be quite boring and not really relevant to others. In One Piece early period, one episode can comprise of 2 manga chapters which is quite acceptable, but recently the comparison of eipsode:manga become 1:1 instead of 1:2; making the story progression in current anime arcs quite long. Still, it is enjoyable to watch every episode. 
 
Art:10/10 
The art is very nice. Even though some people complained that all of female characters look like Nami/Robin, I dont really see that as a problem. I like how the character expressions are made which can make you really feel how they are feeling (for instance when they are crying). 
 
Sound: 10/10 
Nice sound and fits perfectly with the scenes. The sound can ignite your psychological feeling on what happened (for instance, increasing the sadness feeling in sad scenes) Also, I like the OSTs which are enjoyable to listen most of the times. 
 
Character: 9/10 
I love how the character developments progress everytime. Not only the strawhats, but also other supporting characters in different arcs also experience progression as well (eg: crocodile, jinbe, hacchi, etc) 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
It is very nice to enjoy, however, sometimes the episode title and AMV may spoil on what's going to happen next. Even though, it is still nice though for the anime to extend some scenes which are not really explained in the manga so everything told in the anime become pretty clear enough. 
 
 
Overall: 8/10 
It can be potentially 10/10 but there are blood censorship, slow progress, which is quite annoying. Still it deserves 9/10 overall

    One Piece started airing in 1999 and has been airing non-stop ever since then. It has reached over 700 episodes, and the animation hasn't been top-notch ever since around the time-skip. But, there are better things about One Piece that aren't about the animation and... well, the length of One Piece is the least thing I worry about. If you really like the show, and enjoyed it, like I did, I finished it in around 2 months, and am now bored and don't know what to watch. It's not that I don't know what to, I'm not really motivated to watch anything right now. 
 
Gol D. Roger was known as the Pirate King who was the strongest pirate who ruled the seas. Well, I don't have to explain this, because the page of MAL says it, so explaining it is kind of useless. Although this is the main story, it branches off into several characters stories, who have their own kind of backstory. Luffy's is shown in the first couple of episodes, and re-shown after the Marineford arc, what really happened. Zoro is also shown within the first 20 episodes... well, I ain't sitting here explaining which backstories were shown in which episodes. But, the story keeps on going and going which is my favourite part about One Piece. 
 
The animation and art-style... It ain't the greatest thing in existence. But, unlike other people, I frankly don't give a shit. I franky don't give a shit. Ha! Nah, sorry, I'll kill myself right now. Anyway, I don't care for the animation and art-style as long as the content is still good. I can watch things with not-so-good animation and art-style as long as the story and content of it is good. 
 
The soundtrack is my second favourite thing about One Piece. I think it's second. Well, anyway, I like how a scene you try not to bawl your eyes out in,  and you're succeeding... until.... SAD MUSIC SLASH! Yeah, this is basically what happens. And then they kill you. 
 
The characters, third favourite. I have a lot of favourite things about this anime. I like sometimes how they re-use voice actors for different characters in the series. It's easier than finding new people, so I kind of see why they do this. The character development though, is so good. It makes Boku no- Not the best example, so I won't say anything. 
 
I enjoyed this anime a lot. I didn't start watching it a lot until the Enies Lobby arc (late 200s and early 300s) and it wasn't the greatest series before then. But, after that moment, I started watching the anime a lot, every day even. I ain't a serious anime watcher or reviewer, so I can't judge an anime better than someone that actually lives off of this. But one thing I can say is, this anime is great. If you're planning to watch it, don't stop before at least Arlong Park. If you still don't like it at Arlong Park... well... try to get to Alabasta at least. It's one of the first big arcs, and Alabasta features one of the first main villains to ever appear. So, don't back down from the first couple of episodes. Continue. Continue. Watch it all... 
 
...or just read the manga.

    No single review could ever amount to the magnitude of mixed feelings i've felt watching this anime over the last 12 years, but it's a risk worth making should i only succeed in making this single point crystal clear.  
 
Story: 10/10 
I often ask myself ""What makes a good story?"", but quite interchangeably I now ask ""What makes One Piece's so good?"" - what separates it from everything else, and why would anyone in 2017 commit to the behemoth of episodes?  
Well ... for the most part I don't think many people 'can' watch it. It's my belief that had you joined the roller coaster 18 years ago, it would be much easier to love because this anime certainly hasn't aged well for those without the highest form of patience and it's excruciatingly slow-paced. Yet, returning to my former question what separates it's story is the 'Flow' - and it my belief this is what has made it a masterpiece (Filler & Specials excluded). Sadly, we're seeing less and less emphasis on this basic storytelling technique, as sophisticated plot and characters take the center stage. I've yet to see a new successful action anime without apocalyptic stakes and drama we've all seen many times. The brilliance of One Piece is that the stakes and drama unfolds onto the characters themselves and their friends but never onto the World. As a result the plot is naturally driven by the characters as they frequently react to their needs, wants, loves and desires. New land's call to them, but they have a choice and some of this anime's drama in the beginning revolves around Captain Luffy's leadership but as the anime progresses a group-friendship born from love, tragedy, desperation and forgiveness rises, and with their loyalties - so, too does their Standing (Power) to the World.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
The Captain and First Mate of all Pirate Crews are hierarchical of strength, however to Luffy's Strawhat Pirates the title is mainly a formality, however for the sake of time, i will argue the strongest of the group are reflective of the rest and it's also worth noting that exclusive 'best friends' don't really exist among the Strawhats as their friendship is mutual across the crew. The unique bonds between characters may at times be confused as a character's preference to one another but when boiled down, they treat everyone the same. 
 
Monkey D. Luffy 
To the onlooker, I could understand how Luffy appears as cheesy 'Comical Relief' character and to an extent this is true. In the face of danger that would otherwise strike fear or anger into his peers, he will be remembered by me as the most light-hearted anime character of all time, but also the most wrathful. I see many similarities between Luffy and Goku (DBZ) only Luffy's living in harsh world, forcing a more human/realistic character. For instance in his mistakes and weakness, he'll weep and apologize. There's no coming back from the afterlife, and death leaves it's scars on him . His passion and dream for discovering the One Piece treasure far exceed anyone else in the World, however he wouldn't hesitate to throw it all away if it meant saving a friend. The very little ego he bears is seen in the rare times he must stop being a friend and act like a Captain for the sake of others and his dream.  
 
Roronoa Zoro  
Best defined as the untameable beast with swords, who is indifferent from all his comical friends in his seriousness. I'd once wondered ""Why three swords?"" but this oddity is quickly pardoned by the mastery of his techniques. Ironically he's pretty normal in the world of One Piece and Devil Fruit powers. Again, to ignite perspectives i'd draw as many similarities to differences between Vegeta (DBZ). Pride, separates him from sharing moments with the Crew, and the case is strong for Zoro being more powerful than Luffy, and for what begins as a ""I help you, you help me"" deal between Zoro and Luffy quite slowly turns into a friendship defined by Zoro's actions and never his stubborn words. Character progression is strongest with Zoro 
 
Sound: 3/5 (Excluding Openings and Endings) 
Music throughout does perfectly drive excitement, however these instances come far too rarely and could probably be counted on one hand. It's my belief that those who believe Sound and Art really define good anime are the very cause and death to Creativity in anime, and i can quite easily look past One Piece's under-performing music - though one would do well to note that my standard for 5/5 is one track's 'timelessness' and transgression from anime to communities worldwide (try Shirō Sagisu's - Never Meant to Belong)   
 
Art: 3/5 (Subject to the scrutiny of 2017) - Old art = 2/5 + New art 4/5  
Truly original artistry, however i believe the Story deserves the credit after all it's the catalyst for the artistic flexibility that's  hardly ever allowed by typical plots.  
 
Overall: 25/30 ~ 83/100 ~ B Performance 
To conclude, the anime isn't perfect. 
Many deter from it, or Drop the series by virtue of it's art and slow pacing which are fair considerations to have especially when subscribing to an anime  debated to be only  50% to 80% completed at 700+ episodes. My advice would be against the average viewer attempting it. Many of today's action series run fast towards the cataclysmic conclusion. Only once you get bored of the same recycled plots and character template should you consider the voyage of One Piece.  
 
Everybody searches for an anime that will leave them wanting more, but with One Piece you don't have to wait, but you still need patience :D 
 
Sincerely, 
Willowboy.

    I started watching this series to see what the fuss was all about. I like the premis of the story, the art and the characters (no developements though), but the pacing is awful. Most of the times I skip 5-8 minutes at the beginning of an episodes until the story slowly progresses. I didn't mind that much when there was a good story arc, I just felt sightly annoyed. But now I reached an arc, which is not that engaging to me, so the slow pacing really takes away a lot of the overall enjoyment. It might have been really good, if they had paused once in a while to break it into several seasons à 25 complete episodes. I will continue watching (and skipping half of the episodes+fillers) none the less , because it is fun at times.

    I have been converted into a One Piece fan... there I said it. But that would make for a poor and short review so, let me start off by saying, I hated one piece for many years. I cannot stress enough how much I disliked it.  This wasn't for the usual reasons either like the unusual Art style or the english dub (I haven't heard that since it first aired on toonami when I was a kid). I blame it mainly on the anime just being flat out boring for the first 200 episodes. even the Alabasta arc, which was the first major arc of the series was sub-par at best. I was committed to watching this show though in order to find out what all the fuss was about so I must have re-watched up to the sky island arc over 9 or 10 times but still I couldn't figure it out. Eventually I decided to just power through sky island and i didn't regret it.  I discovered that the greatness that is one piece begins at the ""Water 7"" arc. it is the first time That you can see the characters really come into their own and not just win through luck or  crying really hard. It is at this point that the fights hit that ""Let me find an AMV of that"" kind of level. This is also the point when the artwork goes HD and stops looking like a first grader drawing pirates over a water color.  So aesthetically the anime  becomes much more enjoyable as well. This is especially true when the crew reaches saobody, the artwork becomes absolutely spectacular and you begin to look forward to what amazing scenes you will see next. the Characters are all relatable and the stories can be really difficult to pull your head away from. I will admit though, sometimes the constant crying from the main cast can be a bit too much and their general stupidity can also be a bit trying at times, but beyond that, if you can push through the first 200 episodes, you wont regret it. i would give it a 10/10 but the first bit makes it really hard.

    There is an adventure out there for you, what are you waiting for? Stop sitting in your chair or laying on your bed and watch anime and get out there! It's time to search for One Piece! 
 
One Piece is an adventure show that reference pirates that venture out into the sea looking for treasure and whatnot. When we think about anime, one of the anime we would think would be Naruto, Bleach, Dragon Ball Z; and even Pokemon and Yu-gi-oh. One Piece is up there. The story follows true to the plot and still continue doing so as of the current episode. The artwork is very unique and shounen-like, which is befitting for a shounen manga. Music and sounds are superb as all main characters has a theme of their own. And about every characters has their own kind of mindset, but also share similarities. People who dislike and/or drop the series, probably should have give it another chance because the show only gets better as it continues. I can understand the art can be really different from most common and modern anime these days. I know that there are some anime art that I dislike to, I won't say which though. But otherwise, if you think One Piece is overrated, it shouldn't be because I believe it deserves high rating. But until One Piece has a conclusion, I'll rate it 9/10 for now. Depending on the conclusion at the end, it could drop a rating or perfect the masterpiece. 
 
Story: Modern anime now these days, tend to focus on characters more and what they do instead of having an initial plot line from the start, like Luffy wanting to find the One Piece and become King of the Pirate. At the start, there is a slow, but steady pacing of the show, it gets better as more characters are introduced as Luffy travels out the sea looking for more comrades and fun things to explore. The story stays true and doesn't sway from its' purpose. Probably, because how the plot is, it can easily go on and go making new islands (but consistent, of course), new areas, new seas, new characters, and etc. The author that create One Piece is quite imaginative and innovative. Honestly, I have no complaints about the plot or story line so far. I'm just waiting for the conclusion before I can give it a full rating. 
 
Art: Very shounen for a while, but most recently, a little disappointed. I could swear Nami's breast looks bigger than her initial appearance. Yes, I understand that there is a time skip, but actually, Nami's breast looks bigger before the time skip. In fact, why is about every adult women or so, have ginormous breast. This is something I don't understand because One Piece is technically shounen, which means, meant to aim for little boys around age 6 - 12. What happens to average breast, small breast, and flat (for adult women only)? Also, about every women has an hourglass figure? What?! I'm sorry, it just doesn't make sense even in anime universe. Don't get me wrong, they do have fat women and old women in the show, and ugly ones as well as pretty ones. It just that, it kind of inconsistent to shounen and feels not so unique anymore. Other than the breast issue (again with many of the anime these days), the art style is very shounen-like and when there is a fight scene, you can see it display visually well and fliud. Many of the artwork of islands, monster, animals, some-kind of creature, and human themselves, are usually well design and thought out. 
 
Sound: I'm very lenient when it comes down to anime sounds and music. I like the fact that every of Luffy's crew member has their own distinctive theme and it's very appropriate as well. There are a few Opening that are reused often, kind of like how Hunter x Hunter never change the music opening, which can be either a minus or a plus for you. But other than that, soundtrack are original and used at appropriate moments. 
 
Character: I think this is where One Piece shine the most. All Luffy's crew member has a goal and dream in mind that they wish to pursuit. But more importantly, they all share the same line of goals. Luffy is to be Pirate King, Zoro is to be Master of Swordsman in the world, Nami is to be the Navigator that'll map all location including secrets/undiscovered areas, Usopp is to be the King of Sniper (shooting), Sanji wants to find All Blue, Chopper wants to discover all types of herbs and other ingredients that'll help him discover more hidden medicine, Robin wants to find all poneglyphs, Franky wants to create a ship that'll travel all around world, and Brook simply wants to keep everybody entertain as a purpose of his life. Other than Luffy's crew member, other characters both allies and foes are interesting and has their own purpose to do. 
 
Enjoyment: It's an adventure anime show, what is there to be bored of. Some fillers can be boring, but the main canon story isn't dull.  
 
Overall: One Piece isn't my favorite anime, but it is on my top 10 anime list if I were to list it. If you like adventure and the concept of freedom, you'll see it very often in One Piece. Just like our world, in One Piece, there are racism,    and many other things like govt. conspiracy, politician, what is truly justified or not, and it does play an important role in morality. That being pirates are the ""bad"" people and navy marines are the ""good"" people, but in this anime, you'll see that it's not always simple black and white. There are gray areas and characters can be different from what you would think and expect.

For me, it's a great anime, but of course, like all animes, it has several flaws and stuff that I do not really like. 
The first thing I do not like: It's very entangled, they only need 3 things, it takes 30 to 40 episodes for them to complete. 
The second thing I do not like much: A long time ago I began to realize that the anime / manga began to be ""infantilized"", if I may say so, as before the animation was coarser, nowadays the animation is lighter. 
Now let's talk about the things I love about the play. 
First: Oda has a lot of creativity to create characters, I would never be able to create a single character on my own (of course he does not do it all by himself, but anyway, right?), So much so that I will be inspired by Oda's work to create the game I'm developing. 
Second: If he says that something is super rare, then this thing really will be super rare, example: a zoan myth.

    When I started the early episodes one One Piece, honestly it was a bit of a chore (it took me 150 episodes to actually see the genius taking route in the series). The only reason I kept going was because of my curiosity- there had to be something that made this behemoth of a series so successful and enabled it to go on for so damn long! 
 
And there definitely is, it's just a   matter of whether the payoff is worth the extremely large investment, and whether you're willing to dive into an ongoing 750+ episode anime packed with not entirely original content that's already been done before, seen before and displayed with much more visually impressive and compact  Shounen series like My Hero Academia, Nanatsu no Taizai & Magi. 
 
Personally, I'd say yes it most definitely is, but not for the reasons you'd initially want or suspect. 
 
Despite being a battle Shounen, the fights in One Piece are somewhat lacking in creativity and excitement. Which is ironic, because the world of the series is outrageous; many of the abilities outlandish and downright bizarre- I mean the protagonist is literally made of rubber.  
 
But good lord, do not watch this series if you want insane fights and balls to the walls action because the anime does not bring it to the table...aside from maybe a few times. The animation plays a huge part in that though and honestly I'm torn on how to rate it- because sure, there are a lot of lazy parts & tons of still frames during fights, but the color palette is bold and the character designs are just zaney as hell. Most notably the antagonists who somehow manage to look equal parts ridiculous and intimidating; the charactarizaton is nothing to scoff at. 
 
So I'll cut One Piece a little slack- it has been airing continuously for nearly my entire life span! 
 
However menacing that statement seems, it also means that One Piece has over 800 named characters, all playing some role in their respective arcs. With such a large cast, it's impossible to not find hundreds of them endearing! The only problem being that they almost always never get enough spotlight because the plot of One Piece NEVER STOPS MOVING. 
Love that new character? Don't get too attached because you probably won't see them again for another 300 episodes! 
 
The main characters go from island to island to island to island, which makes sense because they're an infamous pirate crew with a thirst for adventure...but sometimes the story needs to just take a breather, and so do I. 
So many things are going on with so many different characters in different places, that One Piece has developed this terrible habit of jumping about frequently, simultaneously making me want to both slow down & speed up the damn thing. Confusing, I know! 
 
Despite this, with so many arcs, sub-plots and backstories, there's a lot of good content to sink your teeth into. 
After all, One Piece isn't afraid to step away from its main characters unlike many other series of the same genre, and that's something I can't help but admire. We delve into the pasts, plans and aspirations of many side characters, as well as the history of the world of the series itself and whilst it may not always be done to a T, it does a damn good job trying.  
 
Nobody is irrelevant in the story however small their role might seem. The true appeal of One Piece doesn't come from action or cool fights, but rather from affairs happening in the background or the possibility of exciting future events. 
 
Really, watching One Piece is like watching somebody building a mansion from start to finish. It starts with such a basic concept,  but before you know it you're tangled up in this huge web that never stops spinning, and One Piece is definitely one big web. 
 
The characters  are treated much the same way- simple, yet suddenly not. Now,  One Piece is not an introspective series by any stretch of the imagination (just look at Luffy, the representative and heart of the story) but it is not one where characters are good or evil, black or white. Yes, some are more good than others and some innately more cruel...but most of the characters do good and do bad, and I think that makes them instantly more likable and relatable. The development of the characters might not be great, but the fact that they're greatly flawed makes up for that most (not all) of the time. 
 
The world-building however, is consistently impressive. With it's own intricate political system and flourishing world, it's not difficult to find  One Piece's setting astounding, and the amount of creative genius that's poured into it's fictituous world is nothing short of admirable. 
 
One Piece isn't always great- some arcs flop, some go on too long, character gimmicks can be grating and half the main cast disappear for episodes on end, but when the series shines, it shines bright.  
 
And to me,  a series is pretty damn magical when you can roll with its flaws and still love the hell out of it. One Piece is a journey of numerous ups and downs where you can't have the good without the bad; individual taste dictates whether it's worth the investment.

    ``You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything in one place! Now you just have to find it!`` - Gol D. Roger. 
  
For an anime having literally almost 1000 episodes and still ongoing to be enjoyable, I don't even know what I can say. This anime is literal gold, I have never seen anything like it and everything about it is just amazing. Well, except the timeskip. 
 
STORY - 10:  
Gol D. Roger, the King of the Pirates obtained this and everything else the world had to offer, and his last dying words drove countless souls to the sea. ''You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything in one place! Now you just have to find it! - Gol D. Roger.'' Those words that the Pirate King spoke, started an era. An era that would change the world as we knew it. 20 years later, Monkey D. Luffy, a 17 year old who ate the cursed ''Devil Fruit'' which gives amazing powers but the disability to swim, has a love for adventure, and strives to become a pirate because of his inspiration, a pirate named Shanks. Shanks taught Luffy everything, and even sacrificed his arm for Luffy when he was a young child. Young Luffy then realised the dangers of the sea, and Shanks gave him his trademark Straw Hat and made a promise to Luffy so he could bring it back when Luffy becomes a great pirate. Heading back to the present, Luffy sets off in a mini-boat, and encounters new friends, powerful foes with the powers of the Devil Fruit, amazing islands and becomes stronger along with his crew-mates to find the legendary treasure left behind by the Pirate King... The ONE PIECE! 
 
ART - 6: 
For the first 500 episodes, One Piece's art was incredible, despite the animation (movements) were little to average. Despite that, I believe the character designs are extremely creative and that Oda was thinking right when drawing them, not saying it's bad but I believe it's not as good as other anime I've seen. 
 
SOUND - 10: 
Oh god, the music of One Piece is amazing. It just captures every moment, from the struggles, the sadness, the pain, the danger, the fun, you can feel how it is for the character's. Honestly, if One Piece had another soundtrack, it just wouldn't match the sense of adventure it is. 
 
CHARACTER - 10: 
I don't even need to say anything for this, watch the anime yourself. Each and every one of them are something else. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 10: 
The first 516 episodes were one of the best episodes I've seen for any series I've seen in a long time.

    Undoubtedly one of my favourite animes of all time! The way the anime started and how the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and his crew become these unique pirates who usually solve every problem while trying to the the Pirate King is just super addictive. 
 
The best part about One Piece is the suspense maintained! The reveals are perfect for every character! The fans and the audience know what they want to know like ""What is One Piece?"", ""What is 'D'?"", ""What is the secret of the Poneglyphs?"", ""What are the three strongest weapons?"" so on and so forth. Some might complain that the anime is going too long but One Piece will always be the biggest and the best adventure by a Crew! 
 
Eichiro Oda has given the fans so much to look forward to! I want to know the end but I dont want the series to end! Nostalgic! 
 
Happy Watching!

    I am bias. Though, it is a bias in a weird way. On one hand, One Piece is one of my favourite series, (so much so that I have a podcast surrounding it - channel is linked on my profile if you're interested) but on the other hand I can barely force myself to watch 20 minutes of this show at a time. 
 
The manga One Piece is no.1 in popularity/sales world wide, though most of those sales do come from japan itself. There is good reason for this, the world of One Piece is densely populated, energetic, and memorable, but this is all because of the superb writing of the manga. The anime is able to produce a similar effect albeit at the pace of an amusement park line but that is only because of the writing it adapts. The fact of the matter is that 90% of the time One Piece fails as an adaptation. There are countless moments where the impact of a scene is neutered due to either horribly off-model art, stunted (or even no) animation or incredibly long cuts. 
 
If you're looking to get into one piece and you want to see if its for you then I would still urge you to start with the anime as its main problem is its pacing which begins after the first Saga (after ep 50). It actually starts with the pretty desirable pace of 2-3 chapters an episode. The early anime feels energetic and alive because of this. After this saga though it becomes something entirely different, getting through the show between ep. 60ish- 240ish is hard without having a filler guide handy. The pacing becomes much worse after filler arc become a thing of the past. Instead of creating non-canon content the team at Toei decided to eventually do away with that and opt into stretching the canon content, a choice which has completely destroyed this shows quality. 
 
Putting pacing aside, what can I say about the sound design? The music is top quality, specifically some of the more somber songs used earlier on, I'll often find myself revisiting many songs. More recent addition, although still being well produced don't quite fit the world which is so important to one piece. What worst of all is Toei's stock sound effects, which seem to have been reused from Dragon Ball much of the time. 
 
As for the art and animation, it's hard to really come to a solid conclusion on this. Its up and it down, its hot and it cold, it's yes then its no. Seriously, there are long bouts of nearly unanimated scenes with off-model characters occupying the foreground which is extremely jarring. The thing is, when the anime decides to look good it really looks good. Some of the scenes are have become some of my favourite pieces of animation but they're so spread out amongst the mountains of garbage that its hard to really give praise to the animation with out first insulting it. 
 
At its core though, this still is one piece. What you can expect is some powerful emotional moments and strong character writing, fun adventures, and unique character designs, and a living world just asking to be dived into. The series is filled with large and small scale mysteries and history, all of which is handled masterfully and with care. When doing through one piece for the first time it feels dynamic and different. As the series continues it shows that nearly any plot which has arisen will meet a satisfying end. It's a series which I couldn't recommend more, but in the anime's case is done so poorly. 
 
I N   C O N C L U S I O N 
if you enjoy battle shonen stories then this is my must attempt. It is no.1 for good reason, but the anime is just not the right way to go about it. Watch those first 50 or so episodes then switch to the manga. It's a much better use of you time and if you wanna see a scene animated that badly, you could always find a clip of the important scenes. 
 
All things considered, 7/10 if you really only wanna watch the anime you should get around to it eventually.

    Three complaints I hear from people about One Piece is A) it's too long! Of course, it's going to be long, this series is about 20 years old - that's the same age as me and considering how popular it is in especially in Japan, it's not a surprise that the anime has 800+ episodes with a manga almost at 1000 chapters. The fact it's still a top dog after both Naruto and Bleach ended while stories like Fairy Tail are crashing and burning, shows how much more depth there is to this series. 
 
So some advice - who said you had to watch all of it in one sitting? Watch it arc by arc whenever you feel like it. Enjoy it. If you want something to watch for the laughs - WATCH ONE PIECE.  
 
B) Weird art style. Something I never understood is people thinking One Piece is weird looking. I find it refreshing because of how unique it is. Actually rather than unique, it's more like it doesn't follow the anime style stereotype even within a shounen series which makes it stand out in terms of design. 
 
Advice - if the art style bugs you to the point you can't concentrate on the series, stop watching it. I have seen many series where the art style was not my favorite but I watched it anyway because I enjoyed the series.  If the story captivates you enough, eventually the art won't matter to you anymore.""Kingdom"" was one such series for me. 
 
C) The English dub sucks. Okay first off, who said you had to listen to it in dubbed? Second, the Funimation version is better and follows the original without changing anything, unlike the 4kids dub. Third I tend to prefer dubs because I can multitask while I'm watching since I have no subtitles to read. Also since it is a long series and I read the manga as well, I watch the anime whenever the dubbed arcs come out. This way I get a break in between and don't feel overwhelmed with the series. Plus, I enjoy watching the fight scenes animated. 
 
Advice - if you enjoy dubbed watch it in dubbed if you like subbed than watch it in its original version. Also, many dubs have been really well made - even better than the original like FMA/B and DBZ. So don't rule a dub out just because you think dubs suck. 
 
Now time for my thoughts on the series: 
 
One must appreciate the complexity of this anime. I mean many shows are good with just 25 episodes but were not talking about simply defeating the bad guy or achieving a dream, this show is about Pirates having adventures. This means that the end goal doesn't really matter, it's about the journey and when you're creating the world around travel, that means you have to be able to have enough material to create unique characters, islands and somehow make it seem like all of these adventures are connected with one another to the main story plot- i.e. Luffy becoming the Pirate King. That's not an easy task and Oda has preplanned this series so far in advance that things that appear trivial in one arc become really important later on. Like ""Thriller Bark"" when we meet Brook, the 9th member. We assume it's just adding another crewmate but this one arc had Easter eggs connecting to the current arc in the series dealing with the ""Four Pirate Emperors"". That's key because one of the biggest complaints I have heard about Fairy Tail as a series is the missing plot points. In terms of foreshadowing skills and using flashbacks, One Piece has it in the bag. 
 
Complaint D) is the pacing is slow in the beginning. Which is true but that's so each character has a foundation - the Straw Hats don't just take any random member, each crew member has a specific role within the ship, they are fundamental to the stories progression so they need to be flushed out, we aren't talking about fodder characters like in every other pirate crew.   
 
The show also explores the dichotomous relationship between Pirates and Marines and that they're not as black and white as we think they are. As the world and characters are flushed out we see that there are some major problems and it just so happens that the Straw Hats are always in the middle of it.  
 
This series talks about a lot of complicated topics but in a light-hearted way that makes you not take the anime too seriously but understanding that there is a lot of depth behind it. Some examples of tough topics explored are domestic abuse, human slavery/trafficking, discrimination,  & classism.    
 
In terms of world building the anime is fantastic - there are a few filler arcs but compared to Naruto, they are nothing, 98% is canon.  
 
Music wise it's quite catchy and has a fun loving tone that makes you excited to see the crews adventures. 
 
Character wise it has some of the most well-rounded characters in a series, even for side characters, considering it has such a large cast, that's quite impressive :D - long running series like Naruto failed to do that which is sad considering most of the series was located within the Leaf village. [Don't get me wrong I'm a Naruto fan but I am not afraid to admit it has its faults] 
 
One Piece is a series that's full of surprises - aka. I found Sanji annoying and dismissed his character as a total flirt - current arc within the series, I adore him. Very few series has made me change my mind on a character especially this deep in. You will find many characters to love or hate - I'm looking at you Akainui - but that's what makes this such an entertaining series to watch.  
 
In terms of Shonen series, I would say One Piece is one of the most well-developed stories out there and would tell anyone to give it at least a shot. The series may surprise you. 
 
Also to those that hate when a character is only ever OP, in One Piece these characters do struggle and they do lose. And characters do actually die without any of that Dragon Ball Z they all keep coming back to life bullshit. Again love the series but people find Fairy Tail characters not seeming to be able to die annoying while I find even when DBZ characters die they just come back to life like it never even happened.

    Review 29: One Piece (Yay Gum Gum fruit)!!!! 
 
A Worldwide favourite, but i only have one question, is there actually an anime out there that can take this one off of the shelves in over 1000 different countries?? I think not. 
 
Meet the clinicaly insane straw hatted pirates, that always seem to get their own way..... One Piece is a world wide famous anime and manga series to little five year olds, too 60 year olds who still remember the series from a while back. The series is packed with food, fighting, rather confusing moments and really (and i emphasis really) weird looking pirate maniacs that will do anything to get the one piece and the devil (gum gum) fruit. 
 
The main story in the series... well when i say main story i mean the overall series.... is supposed to about a young high pitched, squeaky voiced boy named Monket D.Luffy finding the one Piece to eventually become the King of Pirates like in ancient myths and legands. One problem though, he doesn't even have a ship, never mind a crew. And due to his young age no other pirates take him seriously even though he's trying to do them all a favour by helping them get to the One Piece and becoming the new King of the Pirates with them in his crew.  
 
The only time people or pirates usually take him serious, this keeps up through out the whole series of One Piece, is when he shows his what he calls his ""Gum, Gum Abbilities""... So to us this will be the devil fruit powers. When a devil fruit is consumed and depending on which type you have consumed then special un'realistic powers are released that you may or may not be able to control depending on how mature and smart you are.In this case Luffy has consumed a rare Devil Fruit that gives the consumer to extend parts of his of hers bodies to unbelievable lengths, and when punched the punches fly right off of his body or when shot at the rubber sends them flying back at the opponent. So basically we have a weird boy with an even weirder rubber body..... 
 
The series is based in another and slightly older fashioned world where pirates, thieves, bounty hunters and other strange peope all exisist mainly to defeat pirates but also to keep order in the world, stop wars between other countries and are also mainly here to stop pirates from over taking other towns and cities like they have done in the past and when we watch the series we get to see the over taking of many cities and towns happening right before our straw hatted and clinically insane pirates. 
 
The main character (as we have already established) is Luffy, his main goal in life is to be like Gol D. Roger. He was in fact the previous Pirate king and created the One PIece, a treasure that most normal people think is fake and is a disgrace to their world. Others like Luffy (and some others) Who have realised that if they obtain the One Piece they will be the next Pirate King, and as soon as news about a new pirate king starts to spread many more people will believe in the legand, which then means more fights and violence for Luffy and his soon to be crew. Everyone in the crew is human, well to an extent anyways.......... 
 
Monkey D. Luffy; Our main and insane character for the One Piece series. he's the leader of the straw hat pirates and has an extremely strange fighting style that stands out to the younger generation of anime watchers and lovers. His fighting style is unique but funny, this adds to the genre of the show which is of course a comedy. As his body strecthes to these unbelievable lengths and his body can also deflect damage from opponents it adds humour to any fight that he's in which means that if your reading the manga the reader can relax as they know that he'll never be in any real danger, when watching the anime we can sense some danger in a few situations but nothing to serious to make the watcher hang on to the edge of their seat as they are worried for him. He's a fun loving boy who doesn't really see the seriousness of fighting or being a pirate until other members start joining the crew. He doesn't really care what other people think of him or what other pirates think of him and his crew, the only time he will care is when a pirate or human hurts on of his crew members or damages his ship. He isn't the type of person to start a fight for no particular reason and usually thinks things through when it comes to fighting, when it comes to his friends and every day life he turns a little bit stupid, the stereo typical type of person for an anime like this and as he is in fact the lead character it means all other characters are also laid back, relaxed and at times can be as stupid as him. 
 
The crew eventually becomes huge, one of the first members to be the fearfull Roronoa Zoro..... A three bladed samurai, he was born to kill and to assinate anyone who gets in his way. Luffy managed to get him to join as Zoro had already been captured by the authorities and was tidied up to a pole, he hadn't eaten in a while so Luffy had amanged to taunt him with food and bribe him by setting him free on one condition....... He joined Luffy's crew, even though at this point he didn't even have a ship.  
 
The recruitment for the other members also covers the same sort of method, Luffy makes a deal with them as long as they join his crew. As i said eventually there are quite a  few members that join the crew, some hate Luffy as he's way too hyper and some admire his dreams and goals in life to become the next king of the Pirates. we see new and old characters that Luffy has encountered through the series joining the Crew once they get to know him a bit better, like Nami we see her in the firs episode of One Piece and the audience expects her to join the crew straight away but it takes a while as she follows them around and then decides to join, and there are others who we only encounter a bit further on in the series like Brook, Sanji, Usopp, Nico  Robin, Franky..... And if you haven't even watched the series even once then you still might of heard of little Tony Tony Chopper!! 
 
All in all the series is amazing, i've only seen parts of the series and little snipits but it's still an amazing series! Only theres one little problem, the begininning of the series graphics seem out of date, and when we see the latest episodes the beginning ones don't quite fit in. But apart from this the series is amazing and is a must watch, it's famous world wide and has captured the hearts and minds of millions of anime and manga lovers!!

     One Piece is the best! At first I hated the art but I was up for any new anime shows because I seen alot and I'm very picky about what I watch. So I suggested you watch this do Not I mean Not watch the DUBBED ones it better to just watch the orignal subbed ones instead. You can if you want to but I'm just warning you don't watch the english ones.

    basically this is not some cute girls type anime People watch these (shit).The story is good,emotional,and teaches about friendship by far the best possible way. epic action's epic battles, just the right amount of humour that never gets you bored. there are some episodes which wil disappoint but that is a problem in every anime!!. so watch it or your missing out on a great ANIME! 
made it short so more people actually read it THX

    Lemme say this first, I watched over 100 anime, almost all the main streams and out of all them I gotta say that this right here, One Piece, it the greatest I have watched by far. Here's the review 
 
Story - The author really knows what hes doing. The main character Luffy, is a rubber human after eating the gomu gomu no mi. His goal is to become the Pirate King so he sails out of his small home village to pursue his dream meeting many people on the way, some that become his friends, and some that join his crew. Luffy although stupid, he knows how to tell you everything with just his fist. I don't how the author did it, but the way he makes luffy express certain things in few words and simple actions. Although he is an idiot, hes a genius in the way he is. His entire crew all join with a similar goal in life all linked to luffy's may it be to sail the whole world, make a map of the whole world, or discover what hasn't been discovered. Another thing they do great in this anime is foreshadowing, things from the first few episodes can come around again 500 episodes later. They explain a lot of things, and when you forget about them they bring it back. They constantly hint at the Will of D, Luffy's father, Luffy's brother, as well as what one piece REALLY is, and how everyone is connected to it. This is the only anime that can make me shed tears over and over.600 episodes out and it still hasn't gotten dull, virtually no fillers, and still a bunch of story left to be told. It's a huge world with different species, races, discoveries. 
 
Art - the Art is not the best, it's a unique style and many people hate on it. Unlike a majority of anime that fail to realize that there are many different looking people in the world, and in the world of one piece there are even more different looking people, ugly, deformed, strange, attractive, large, small, they are all drawn in their own way. The author is an artist and can draw bleach like drawing but doesn't, its not like he cant. What I really like about this drawing is the way it can express emotion. If you look at luffy angry, you feel it, you feel the intensity of his angry, its like you wanna punch your screen just as hard you wanna punch the villain in the face. 
 
Sound - The music is good, very pirate like if i were to describe it. Each crew member have their own theme song that match their personality well. They know how to make situations sound good using the music. 
 
Characters - Well developed, all though they look like a happy bunch now but each member has their own dark past, all of them been through a lot and almost all of the back stories will stab you in the heart and make you cry for them. It's because of their past that they have such a respect for luffy, the one that understands them and can bring out their good sides as well as vanquish their bad. 
 
Enjoyment - Very enjoyable, being a beautifully made comedy and action anime it can make you feel the intensity of battle while also making you laugh. It has a lot of drama and sad stories so it's not always all laughs. 
 
Overall - 9/10 The beginning is bad and childish but as the audience got older so does the content, you have to tolerate the first few episodes, they are just introductions, it gets way better. Stable story with a lot left to uncover.

    I used to love this anime, it is actually what started me of on anime and manga. It had everything I needed at the time: something that will go on for a while, thus a story I can follow without getting to the ending to fast. Comedy, drama, action, tragedy and fantasy. 
Sadly the anime does not seem to stay as true to the manga as it once did, from 200 and forward the quality of the anime starts to drop. In a sad way to keep the anime at the right pace, the animators start to alter the parts of the ""journey"" to draw out the episodes and sadly most of the time they make the characters act like idiots, doing things that their manga counterparts realized was stupid or just never did. Like doing the same thing to an enemy multiple times without effect, or fighting an incredibly much weaker character and still having a hard time, even though it usually ended in an instant in the original work. The fillers are usually boring with mediocre characters being introduced constantly to never be heard of again and weirdly tied into an altered story to fit. The series being so long also seems to affect the studios that work on it and its directors, which becomes highly noticeable when the art turns into a weird copy of Naruto art with simplified character drawings and repetetive scenes. Honestly after having a 3 minute intro, a 1 minute summary of overall series plot and then a 5-8 minute previous episode summary, you are left with 15 minutes of ""new"" where in some episodes half of it is reused scenes from 3 minutes ago or from the previous episode.  
 
So the point I am doing is: it is a good series, but the anime does no longer do it justice. So if you ever feel like the story and characters are starting to feel stale, you should probably dip into the manga, many of the repetetive scenes are not in it, and the art does not look like it got simplified over the years, but rather more polished. Though keep in mind that some episodes are actually original works of the author not included in the manga, they are usually good but they never get tied into the story so there is no problem missing it either.

    I have seen the great shonen anime. Naruto, roughly 90 episodes and i left by bored. Bleach, however, loved it, but history is not great and strong. HxH, which is one of the best animes I've seen in my life. In One Piece, I cried, I laughed. Many of my favorite characters are anime One Piece (Rayleigh, Shanks) for their ways of thinking and appearances. Luffy's band is fantastic, all the characters you take them affection. What I'm getting at is that many chapters have, that should not throw you back. For many chapters have and although the beginning is very weak, over time, it repays the time spent.

    The story of One Piece is interesting and sometimes engaging. The art is not really appealing and could use major improvements. The sound is not really special or catchy. There are very few songs that will make you cry or jump out of your seat. The characters in the East Blue arc have really heartbreaking and solid background stories. I like how all of them have goals that they want to accomplish. It is nice to see a group of characters with different goals, but overall the same purpose. Which is to help Monkey D. Luffy become the pirate king. Sadly, with all this said I'm still disappointed. I do not like how the characters are just brushed over and there is no expansion on their foundational stories. It feels like they are introduced, their stories are told, and then immediately cast aside as side characters. I would like to see them develop more and actually see the progress they each made to fulfilling their goals.

    To be honest my score should not be taken too seriously because most of the 10s are what I give for the manga. Overall the anime is great, but it really is way bad compare to the manga. 
 
The story, if regardless most movies, no doubt will be 10/10. The way how it took off my personality mask and touched me is great indeed, when Usopp Pirates disbanded, when Hiluluk laughed about his coming death, when Saul told Robin nobody is born to be lonely, when Coby stopped Sakazuki and trying to protect the rest of the marine soldiers, when Kyros was holding Scarlett's body and crying for his helplessness, when Corazon put Law in that treasure box and guarded him until his last moment, when Senor Pink traded his dignity in exchange of Russian's smile, when minks guarded Raizo with all of their lives with a honor, when Pudding made her choice with Sanji, probably the man who would love her more than any other man in the world, and the man she may never seen again... I do not know who would stonefacing these scenes. 
 
The art... I have to say almost all good looking characters are looking the same, but from little bit this, and a little bit of that, we could effortlessly tell who they are.  
 
The sound track, I did not continously watching it except major fight and some episodes because the pace is just so sluggish that I felt it is torturing me. But I do found Luffy Moukou and The Very, Very, Very Strongest being my favorite.  
 
Characters are quite spread in the story, so I guess it kinda equal to it 
 
I would say I enjoyed the series... 
 
Man I just hate writing too much words... Overall it is my favorite show along with Jojo, Seven deadly sins, Yugiohs, dumb funny animes, and other animes that I am too lazy to provide names... Only reason that the anime receives a 6 is because its sluggish pace...... by the time Luffy had his first fight with Kaido, he probably already became the pirate king in the manga...... 
 
If you found my score really low, do not blame me, blame Toei.

    This show was a masterpiece up until the underwater island . I definitely encourage you to see it for up to episode 750 i guess (so around 250 hours) of quality anime with incredibly awesome character development and back story. Afterwards the show reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly slow down . each episode now contain the minimum ""content"" you can put into an episode. However if you can read the manga unlike me , you will have all the fun. 
 
The anime Arc system is one of the best , because each island is like an arc (more of a level) . each island got the same idea of progress , which sound boring but is extremely fun . Every here and there he is collecting a crew member some are better than other (as for you the viewer) .  
 
Art style back then is kinda shitty because it was made in 1999 now its ... more shitty but in HD . As i said , you will be faced with an awesome anime that will sadly loose its brightness .  
 
Mostly if you wanna know why I recommend this it will be because of emotions this anime give you . in each backstory you will cry , in most arcs you will cry . both of sadness and joy

    this is one of the best animes it has alot of stories derived from many legends and characters that are also taken from iconic people and the plot twist are just awesome and thought through ,and it has alot of unanswered questions though it is in 800+ episodes but the stories and the why they are told is really satisfying and feels great but one thing that most viewers must understand about this anime is that it is ok to skip some fillers episodes maybe come back to them later if you want but i remember when i started watching this anime there where about 643 episodes i only watch this anime for month to 2 months tho i didn't skip most of the episodes but you could do that.  
 
so this is my only complain: 
 
one piece is the greatest anime in the story ,character design and plot twists but the only ccomplain i have is that it has alot of fillers alot of episodes that is there just to add the num er of episode side tracking some times it take 4 episode for some one to do something that we all are waiting for and is just like moving 1 inch to open the door for example which is frustrating . 
 
 
so if they make an version with out that bullshit that will be great ... 
 
WOULD I RECOMMEND IT : 
 
YES, of course you woukld be missing out alot of stuff that you would never get from hundreds of thousands of any other anime episodes.... BUT, i encourage you to SKIP EPISODES WHEN THEY ARE JUST FILLERS , there are many websites which tell you if this episode is a canon episode or just  another filler .

     Probably would be a 10/10 if Toei didn't butcher the animation and pacing after the time skip. However, those first 500 episodes were still nearly perfect in every way. Hilarious characters, imaginative worlds and settings, and my favorite aspect of the show is how well each island, character, arc, etc. connects to the overall story. There's almost a sense that everything in the One Piece universe is connected somehow, through the insane amount of characters, or through the crazy vast lands these characters explore. Amazing show (up until timeskip), would watch again. Now since I can't leave a short review have some text art.

    *A few spoilers ahead  
 
One piece is truly an energetic, exciting and binge-worthy anime. The animation has improved. I rewatched some episodes from the beginning and it interesting to see how sharp and clear the animation became.  
 
 The characters have grown a lot throughout the years and the viewers are able to see their progression in their abilities and maturity. The original seven crew members are the best in terms of strength. Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are the strongest, then Franky, Robin and Chopper, and then Brook, Nami and Usopp (the weakest). Additionally, I feel the series was better in the beginning.The attack against CP9, the Alabasta Arc, the fight on Fishmans' Island, the fight against Gecko Moria and the Sky Island has brought the Strawhats closer, and then being separated for two years allowed for their development.  Getting to know each character and their tragic pasts made the story much stronger. The return of many important characters won't list them here happens past 700.  Luckily, we know that Jimbei may or may not be joining the Strawhat crew. 
 
he last two hundred episodes were a bit exhausting. It's the same thing over and over where Luffy fights a strong character and almost gets destroyed but then wins. My least favorite character would probably have to be Usopp. He provided no support or backup the whole time on Dressrosa and all he did was scream for backup. His character development hasn't many any strides since the first 300 episodes it feels like.  
 
 There are some surprising elements that I feel made the story less tight recently. Usually the story is more tight.  It was shocking that the whole crew didn't attack Big Mom's Island - instead Luffy took Nami, Brook and Chopper who aren't the strongest. Zoro should have been there along with Franky.  Also, the fact that Sanji was related to the ""elite"" Vinsmoke family should have been made much more prominent at the beginning. I just feel that the story is a bit unraveling and isn't as concise as it used to be.  
 
Overall, I've fully enjoyed watching One Piece since middle school. It has stayed with me for a really long time and I still feel attached to the story. I was surprised to hear that the anime has no future ""end"" yet though I'm glad I can keep watching it for awhile now.

    Still a masterpiece! One Piece till this day remains consistent with its core appeal. The amazing characters, the heart of the story, the fantastic animation and heart wrenching plot twists. I don't know where i'd be without One Piece. No other long running animation has stayed so true to its fanbase and provided the world-building and momentum to remain relevant. I've gone on so many adventures with the Straw Hats, no matter their heart break I've been with them to watch their resolve, growth and friendship.  
 
It's never too late to start One Piece, once you start you'll get to the most recent episode in no time at all, and you'll be screaming for the next episode like all the other weekly watchers. One Piece is a journey worth taking and I assure you, it doesn't feel long enough.

    Oh, dear...<3<3<3<3 ABSOLUTE TOP! 
I was keeping from this anime as much as I could and since my friends who was in these OP theme always insisted on watching this, i always said NO THANKS NO NO GO AWAY BYE. And here we go in August when I started watching these.. the first mby 20 episodes I was vomiting, I could not even get the point of it, but my friend said CONTINUE, ONE mORE EPISODE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE!!! And I've fallen - the arc about Sanji was the first when I laughed and cried myself out, the second one was with little tanuki and then it started - I was dying to see every episode! And now it's November, 2 and I finished the episode 811. It was 2,5 month of full joy and love, I now understand why OP is in absolute TOP in Japan.. this is a story of smth you will never see in other anime.. this is a soul, a heart, the feelings and this is a deep breath of fresh air. I still wonder how anime that airs 20 years (!!!) IS STILL SO POP AND ORIGINAL, how it hasnt lost its potential, how abroad the imagination of the mangaka. I hope it wil air more and more and more. I just wann say that OP is not the anime...It is WORLD, world where you wish you could live <333 STRONGLY WORTHY OF WATCHING!

    I started watching one piece about a year ago and I caught up very quickly.  
 
Art: So I love this story and it is well written. Although I agree with many people about the art. See wano has GREAT art but now kinda shitty animation however in contrast the pre-time skip era had GREAT animation but shitty art.  And yes I am aware that none of this is oda's fault, it's toei's. See the manga art gets a 10/10 but toei is toei so they ruin it. 
 
Story: Ahh yes the single longest story I have every had the fortune to read/watch. (Very minor spoilers) After Luffy eats the devil fruit an embarks on his quest I was hooked. The imagination that it must have taken to make this story amazing and I love the diversity of the world and characters. It's very rare that one piece is boring and it usually has me one the edge of my seat just waiting to see what happens next. From alabsata to dressrosa to fishman island it has a variety of villains and yet Luffy and crew almost always win. I love this story! I will say however there was one arc I was not fond of and that was Punk Hazard. I found that arc boring and bland but aside from that one arc it is great.  
 
Characters: Well where do I start? There are thousands in this anime. There are just so many and they are all so different. Many of the side characters could each have their own manga or anime. A short(ish) one yes but their own. I think that alone says how great they are. If shanks were to have his own manga then I would be reading that thing so fast you'd think I was the flash. Or if ace or sabo or whitebread or maybe vivi.   
 
Enjoyment: I think at this point you can tell I very much enjoy this 
 
Overall: I highly recommend.

    One Piece is about chasing your dreams and leaving all doubts behind and enjoying life while making new friends saying bye to others and overall living your life to the fullest 
 
𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐲 𝐃. 𝐋𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐲 is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the paternal grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of late ""Fire Fist"" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. Luffy is a pirate and his lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. He has eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which gives the consumer's body the properties of rubber. As the founder and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, he is the first member of the crew, as well as one of its top three fighters. 
 
𝐑𝐨𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐚 𝐙𝐨𝐫𝐨, also known as ""Pirate Hunter"" Zoro, is a pirate and a former bounty hunter. 
 
He was the first member to join the Straw Hat Pirates, and, to date, is considered the largest threat and most dangerous member in the crew after Luffy. His fame as a master swordsman and his great strength, along with the actions of his captain, sometimes led others to believe he was the true captain of the crew. 
 
He is one of the top three fighters in the crew alongside Luffy and Sanji, and his dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world. Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the ""Worst Generation"" (formerly known as the ""Eleven Supernovas"".) He currently has a bounty of Beli320,000,000. 
 
""𝐂𝐚𝐭 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐫"" 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐢 is a pirate and the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates. She was the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town Arc. 
 
She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats in order to rob them for her real crew, but joined the Straw Hats for real after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. She currently has a bounty of Beli66,000,000 
 
""𝐆𝐨𝐝"" 𝐔𝐬𝐨𝐩𝐩 is a pirate and is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. When Usopp was first introduced, he was often (comically) labeled as the ""Liar"" of the Straw Hat Pirates, due to the ""Uso"" (うそ) in his name meaning ""lie"" or ""falsehood"" (嘘). He was born in Syrup Village, and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father. 
 
He was officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join, and, including Nami and Robin, also the third to rejoin, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. His original bounty of Beli30,000,000 was credited to his alias and alter-ego ""Sogeking"". 
 
𝐕𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐦𝐨𝐤𝐞 𝐒𝐚𝐧𝐣𝐢, most commonly known by his moniker ""Black Leg"" Sanji, is a pirate and the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the former sous chef of the Baratie. He is also the third son of the Vinsmoke Family, thus making him a prince of the Germa Kingdom, until he officially denounced them once again. 
 
He is officially the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc. Since he was born in North Blue, he is the first Straw Hat not to originate from East Blue. He is one of the Monster Trio in the crew, alongside Luffy and Zoro. 
 
His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He has a bounty of Beli177,000,000, which is only valid if captured alive, per the request of his father. 
 
𝐓𝐨𝐧𝐲 𝐓𝐨𝐧𝐲 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐫, also known as ""Cotton Candy Lover"" Chopper, is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi which is a devil fruit that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid or a human at will. He came from Drum Island where he learned how to be a doctor, which also makes him the only member of the Straw Hats who was born on the Grand Line. 
 
He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join Luffy, as well as being the youngest member on board. He has a bounty of Beli100 due to being mistaken for the crew's pet. 
 
𝐍𝐢𝐜𝐨 𝐑𝐨𝐛𝐢𝐧, also known by her epithet ""Devil Child"" and the ""Light of the Revolution"", is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
She was originally introduced as the vice president of Baroque Works and the secondary antagonist of the Alabasta Saga, known as Miss All Sunday, before joining the Straw Hats. She is the seventh member of the crew, the sixth to join, and like Nami, is the second to rejoin, doing so near the end of the Enies Lobby Arc. Robin is also the first member to have once been an antagonist. She ate the Hana Hana no Mi. 
 
During the Post-War Arc, she became involved with the Revolutionaries for two years. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history. She currently holds a bounty of Beli130,000,000  
 
""𝐈𝐫𝐨𝐧 𝐌𝐚𝐧""𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐤𝐲 is the shipwright for the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
A cyborg from Water 7, he was originally the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers. He is originally from South Blue, but left 32 years ago as a four-year-old child. He was originally named ""Cutty Flam"" until he threw away his original name for his nickname per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. 
 
Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats until circumstances forced them to become allies. At the request of the Franky Family, Franky decided to join the Straw Hats to fulfill his dream of creating and riding a ship capable of circumnavigating the world, the Thousand Sunny. 
 
He is the eighth member of the Straw Hat crew and the seventh to join Luffy's crew. He currently has a bounty of Beli94,000,000. Previously going by the epithet, ""Cyborg"" Franky, after most likely having his favourite weapon being confused as his main body by the authorities, he has since gained the new nickname, ""Iron Man"". 
 
""𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐥 𝐊𝐢𝐧𝐠"" 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐤 is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
 
He is a skeleton that the Straw Hats found on board of a ghost ship after drifting into the Florian Triangle.  He is a Devil Fruit user who ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, and is undead, having been brought back into a pseudo-immortal state because of its powers.  
 
He is the ninth member of the Straw Hat crew, and the eighth to join Luffy's crew, as well as being the oldest and the tallest member on board. He is also one of the two swordsmen onboard their current ship, with the other being Roronoa Zoro. He fills the role of the long-awaited musician that Luffy had wanted for his crew ever since his journey began. 
He currently has a bounty of Beli83,000,000.

    One Piece is a masterpiece of storytelling that anyone should watch during his lifetime! So what are the gems that lie beneath this story, in general? (I''ll comment about the anime version at the end of this review) 
 
STORY 10: (personal importance factor [pif] x1.4) 
 
Well, there is a lot that can be told about the story but I'll try to be really laconic. We have a newby young pirate named Luffy setting off on his adventure across the oceans to become the King of Pirates. Yes, it's really commonplace. But what's pulling you in on this grossly big adventure is Luffy getting new nakama and the wonderful experiences they come along with as a big family. My compatriot Cavafy's poem (written more than a century ago) describes Luffy's journey in a beautiful and exact way: 
 
As you set out for Ithaka 
hope your road is a long one, 
full of adventure, full of discovery. 
Laistrygonians, Cyclops, 
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them: 
you’ll never find things like that on your way 
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high, 
as long as a rare excitement 
stirs your spirit and your body. 
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,  
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them 
unless you bring them along inside your soul, 
unless your soul sets them up in front of you. 
 
Hope your road is a long one. 
May there be many summer mornings when, 
with what pleasure, what joy, 
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time: 
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations 
to buy fine things, 
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony, 
sensual perfume of every kind— 
as many sensual perfumes as you can; 
and may you visit many Egyptian cities 
to learn and go on learning from their scholars. 
 
Keep Ithaka always in your mind. 
Arriving there is what you’re destined for. 
But don’t hurry the journey at all. 
Better if it lasts for years, 
so you’re old by the time you reach the island, 
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way, 
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich. 
Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey. 
Without her you wouldn’t have set out. 
She has nothing left to give you now. 
 
And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled 
you. 
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, 
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas 
mean. 
 
WORLD-BUILDING: 10 (pif x1.4) 
 
Luffy and his friends travel a long way through an enormous ocean with a major variety of strange and amazing islands, kingdoms and societies awaiting them. Each unique yet a part of a uniform whole. All these different places and societies broach many real-world issues, such as diversity, racism, political corruption and much more... And they are all tied together in a perfect way! 
 
ART: 10 (pif x1.2) 
 
Well, the art (both in manga and anime) complete the whole with respect to the detailed story, as well as the anime version adds an enjoyable liveliness. 
 
SOUND: 10 (pif x0.5) 
 
Outstanding openings and theme songs (not all of them though) which match the story perfectly. I would enjoy downloading them as phone calls. 
 
CHARACTERS: 10 (pif x0.5) 
 
Luffy and his nakama make such a great company that I wish I could become one of them. Their bonds are strong enough to consider them a family and, in another way, their journey is rather a family adventure. One's dream is everyone's dream! Their nakama lives are more important than theirs! This is One Piece! 
 
AVERAGE: 10 (I want moreeee!) 
 
The ONLY very bad thing about the anime (NOT the manga) is that the story proceeds very very slowly from about the Dressrosa Arc and after (~ ep. 630 up to today). This is the reason I dropped it when the arc met its closure. 
 
In conclusion, I could type in front of my laptop's screen for hours but that would be much of a torture for the readers. If anyone reads this at all. :p :p :p

    The prospect of watching through One Piece at this day and age is daunting, to say the least. Past 800 episodes at the time of writing, joining the One Piece hype train can seem impossible; however, if you even think you might be interested in the show, please pick it up. Allow me to explain why: 
 
The story of One Piece is an exploration of a world which has more layers than I hazard to comprehend. Shows which run even an eighth of the length of One Piece often make the mistake of presenting the world in a way where each new segment feels like it was made up for that arc, with hardly a thought beforehand. One Piece, however, unfolds its story and interlocking parts in ways which feel like a rug rolling out before the viewer. The flow of the story feels natural, and One Piece is notoriously good at playing the long game when it comes to characters, places, or information becoming relevant. It's a masterful exploration of how to build a world and then fill it with a story which adequately satisfies the grandiose and the intimate. (10/10) 
 
The art of One Piece, however, suffers greatly. As a TV anime--a TV anime which has aired practically weekly since 1999--it is subject to having to make do on a lower budget than preferable, leading to a lot of dicey background drawings or long-distance drawings. It has shining moments, but it is largely merely adequate. I can comfortably say that if you want to experience One Piece as a visually impressive art form, you are better off reading the manga, which is a masterclass in how to panel a visual story and, by comparison, puts the anime to shame. (6/10) 
 
I have a very soft spot in my heart for the sonic universe of One Piece. Whether the staff which helped put together the first effects and insert songs for the show knew they would be in this gig for the long hall, I do not know; I do know, however, that they have played the long game just as well as Eiichiro Oda himself. A tracklist for an episode today may have two songs introduced in Romance Dawn, two tracks introduced during a Grand Line arc, and two tracks introduced during a New World arc. With nearly two decades of material to recycle, One Piece could easily make do with what they already have; but Kouhei Tanaka and the sound design team are constantly working to outdo themselves and boost the anime to new heights by means of their labor. In episode 826, for example, an entirely new arrangement of the series' very first opening was brought in for an emotional moment, and it quite actually left me in tears. We may never have a long-running series again in our lifetime that will have the opportunity to use music and sound in the same way that One Piece has. Toei's team has taken an area that many overlook in long-running shows and turned it into an integral part of the world and storytelling of One Piece. (10/10) 
 
The characters of One Piece are without peer. Without exception, we see each and every main character at their best and their worst. It's easy to fall in love with an ensemble when you're with them for over 800 episodes, but the humanity and power behind the interactions of the Strawhat Pirates and the people they come in contact with are to die for. (10/10) 
 
One Piece is a romp which does anything and everything you could want in a show. You will laugh, cry, leap from your seat, and cheer for this series. On more than one occasion, I have gone back to rewatch an old arc once I had caught up to a current arc, and the wealth of callbacks in the show thoroughly rewards viewers who make sure they are up to date. (10/10) 
 
Though its art is lackluster, One Piece is practically the perfect battle shonen. If you like action, adventure, fantasy, or a good drama, One Piece has it all in spades. (9/10)

    Right now, at 2:40 in the morning for me, I have decided to write a review for quite possibly my favorite anime of all time. However, I have decided to write it for people who might be off put by the length of One Piece. One Piece, first and foremost, is an anime/manga that follows the story of 1 of many pirates, Luffy, whose dream is to become the Pirate King. Pretty standard shounen stuff right? At first glance, you might be inclined to just skip past this, not only due to it's length, but to it's seemingly generic plot. Generic Shounen Guy wants something, and he's probably going to get it because he's Generic Shounen Guy. That however, isn't the point behind One Piece at all.This anime/manga mainly details the JOURNEY to becoming the Pirate King. One Piece isn't about Luffy's dream to becoming Pirate King, it is about the journey he takes to get there.  
 
Story:  
One Piece has one of the greatest story's I have personally ever read, and a large part of that has to do with the completely unique story One Piece portrays. Yea, you could say that One Piece has elements from other things, but doesn't everything? The story is just grand (outside fillers, which surprisingly, aren't even that awful. And Skypia. I think I'm the only one that doesn't like skypia though) and when things happen, even to characters that you know won't be around during a majority of the adventure, you tend to feel for them.  
 
Art:  
Unlike most older animes, One Piece's art style has honestly aged well, and only gotten better. Nuff Said. 
 
Sound:  
The OST for One Piece is honestly One of the best Piece's of music I've ever listened too. (get it?) The openings are fantastic, and so are the endings. 
 
Characters: 
The characters in One Piece are extremely unique, and are pretty much all memorable, if not by name, but by what they looked like or what they said. Some characters just had a certain way of speaking, others looked extremely funny, and some were just memorable in general.  
 
Enjoyment:  
Some animes that are much shorter than One Piece have often gone on the backburner when I get in the mood for One Piece, mainly because if I'm in that mood, I can't really scratch my anime itch unless I watch some One Piece.  
 
Overall: 
Definitely the best anime I've ever seen, and I challenge anyone to give me one better.

    Action, adventure, comedy-- If you're looking for the perfect mix of epic action and dramatic, tear-jerking scenes, well my friend, One Piece is for you.  
 
I think in order to watch One Piece, you've gotta throw away any of your first opinions, because the thing that threw me off at first was the art style, as well as the ""overwhelming"" number of episodes. So disregard those right now, or else you'll miss out on something huge. And stay committed! 
 
The overall character development is sure to cause some tears at some point. Watching (or reading) the powerful backstories of the characters, as well as the inspirational effort shown as they overcame them is truly remarkable. Something many anime have, and always will, have a struggle with, and Oda pulled it off for nine characters, all equally amazing. 
 
Along with the development, the emotions triggered while watching this anime are unstoppable. Be prepared for tears at some point-- grab your tissues. The way the story is presented, you're bound to feel a pang in your chest, or tear up.  
 
The message portrayed in this fun, upbeat anime is also something outstanding. In every episode, One Piece never fails to inspire you, as the characters all chase down their dreams.  
""Follow your dreams, and don't let anyone prove you wrong.""  
 
One Piece is my favourite anime, ever. You'll love it, and it isn't anything like what you may have thought!

    Coming into this anime I didn't have a high expectation, I thought it would be a generic shounen that gained popularity by having predictable story and crap characters.But my god was I wrong. 
 
Story-This is where the show is at it's peak, the story told in one piece was done well overall, at the start it was very good but slowly went downhill with slow pacing and overused dialogue. The story worked in arcs each island the straw hat crew visited each new arc would arrive. Each island had it's own story ranging between interesting, well throughout story's and some having slow pacing and overused dialogue. 
 
 Rarely in the story they would switch from the main plot, they usually keep on focus and don't drift from the main objective. Overall each main character has a simple thing they want to achieve but it comes with heaps of obstacles along the way. This story feels like it could go forever with heaps of things to explore and new mystery coming up along the way. Even though this story is quite predictable it has quite unique plot twists and moments no one saw coming. The pacing at the moment is very slow with around 5 minutes at the start of pure looking back at the last episode. 
 
 Filler is not that common in one piece, but when it comes up it is usually quite interesting. The comedy was well done in this story with each crew mate having there own unique personality and having funny and great rivalries. The action in one piece is very intense with moments done so well you will be out of your seat in excitement or in tears from the well wrote out story's with either happy or sad endings. This story does have some rather pointless arcs but that's what makes the good arcs better it always seems to have a satisfying ending. What makes some of these arcs good are the exploration that comes along with it, the parts where they verse the final villain always seems to be the lowest point of an arc but jut watching them walk around and to see how that island works is much more interesting and always finds away to pull you in 9/10. 
 
Art- One piece is known for it's unique art, there are always mixed opinions about it's unique style and it stops some people from watching the show. The old style of one piece went for around 200 episodes and that's when it was at it's best. The style pulled you in and gave you a more creative feel to it. It then became more colorful and it went from a creative feel to a colorful kid show. They overdid the animation with heaps of mistakes and putting no work into it. In the last 100 episodes of one piece they just seemed to of give up on the animation and make it look like a pile of crap. The first art style felt well with one piece but the rest seemed out of place like it was missing some kind of crazy,wacky feel to it. The only time you saw them use CGI animation was in the 6th movie where they did it the whole way through. This felt a bit wrong at first but then it seemed to fit in quite well. The character designs were a bit over the top with some characters looking like they were just there for comedy purposes. One of the greatest things in one piece were that no characters look the same and they all had weird unique appearances. Overall the art started well but then went downhill 5/10. 
 
Sound- The voice actors in one piece are amazing showing heaps of emotion and giving the characters a fell of realism. It felt like most of them fit the role of the characters being the only one who could do them so well. After each 100 episodes you felt the voice actor get better pushing the amount of emotion they could put into each characters voice. The dubbed voices are not to bad, the funimation dub put a lot of effort finding the right people but there still was a lot of room for improvement. The background music was quite good it fitted with the scenes from the anime and it gave you a sense of emotion or excitement at points. Some tracks could make you cry played at the right time and some could take away that level of excitement at points. The OST is not something I would listen to everyday or every week, but maybe now and then I might listen to some of the better tracks in my spare time. The openings were always good especially 1,18,15,17 all get you pumped up and excited for the episode. The first opening we go does get over praised and is overused in the show with around 5 different versions of it. Overall with some notable tracks good voice acting and great openings one piece gets 8/10 in sound. 
 
Character- Most characters gave something away like if they were smart, dumb, very strong or even if they are weak. Every character has a weakness and a strength. Most characters didn't feel like they reacted to situations in a realist way. If someone was dying they wouldn't save them they would kill the enemy who caused the injury. Most reactions were based around revenge leading into some predictable story lines. With so many characters there will always be one you can relate with, making you find that character like another version of yourself. With a series so long and still going the characters grew quite a bit, but they still have a lot more room to grow personality and strength. The characters changed a little but it made such a big difference and they always found different ways to challenge themselves. Most villains seemed to have a strong motive what they would follow. The depth in some of the characters was very shallow with not to much history or much of a back story. The show had a narrator who was boring showing no expression in his voice. This show had so many characters but each one was done so well making it not noticeable how many characters they used. I think that you will remember most of these characters because of there unique personality. Overall each character is done very well and makes the show a lot more interesting. 8/10 
 
Enjoyment- I feel like most people can enjoy this anime a lot, it had great, memorable moments and some amazing scenes. If you can look past the bad animation you will go on a amazing adventure with highs and lows. This show may be childish but has some deep meanings. One piece could be mainstream if people sat down turned on there TV's and gave it a chance. The whole show would not be able to re watch but overall the great moments I would surely sit back and watch. Owning this series would be very difficult and take out a lot of time so I'm sure there a lot of people that would do it but it wouldn't float my boat. This series will always be remembered as the longest and one of the greatest series of all time with 10 years of it still running there is still a lot of time to change some of the issues in this anime like it's animation and unfitting music. The memorable moments will always be in my mind as some of the greatest moments in anime history. 8/10 
 
Overall this is one for the greatest anime of all time. it has memorable characters and great moments. It will always be remembered for all it's pros and if it will fix it's poor animation it will surely get a 10/10. But of course that's wrong so in the end One Piece will get a 8/10

    Ok, my first anime's were naruto, bleach, and d-grayman. I'd always talk to my friends at school about them and debate and discuss plot elements, characters, etc. However, over our senior trip they started talking about an anime they loved very much and praised more than Bleach at times: it was called One Piece. Now, i'm a bleach die-hard fan so when they kept praising this show i kept thinking ""Whats the big deal?"" I'd heard a bit about One Piece but not too much and i thought it was kinda baby compared to bleach or d-grayman. I also heard how long it was which really raised some doubts. I mean c'mon 400+ episodes long!? how can anything even go for a span as long as that?! I thought it was an overestimated, watered down anime, so when i finally began watching it after yu-yu-hakusho mid-summer i had my doubts and didn't expect much. Please permit me to say it now: I AM SO SORRY. I TAKE IT ALL BACK. One Piece is amazing. Period. The characters I found were likable and before you knew it became like a family, true nakama. The humor was greatly done and made me chuckle all the way through. Now the plot did take a bit to pick up with the actual story, but it didnt matter! The individual adventures were enjoyable and did well with pacing themselves out, even if alabastar and skypiea were a bit long. While the animation was kinda rugged in the biggining (which isnt bad at all considering it was 1999) it picked up nicely after skypiea and looked great. Now it wasnt perfect, it was a bit hard to develope a epic atmosphere at times during some of the arcs due to the more humor bases of the anime (ex. zoros fight with the giraffe was mainly goofing off and the big bad guy for chopper was kinda dumb) but it definatley has its epic moments, even more so than other anime. I sitll go back and watch Luffy kick the crap out of Crocodile and be amazing in his fight against Lucci (he will not fall, so epic!) Oh and while we're on Luffy can i say how much of a man he is! i mean when he climbed that huge mountain to save his nakama or the many other amazing things he did, aw man! And the rest of the crew too! ( if i went into it this would go on forever...oh wait too late, sorry) However one of the greatest things this anime has displays is the true meaning of nakama. The scene were nami is stabbing herself and throwing sand at luffy telling him to go way, and then cries and asks for his help. Aw man the hat symbolism, ""You are my nakama i will protect you"" i still go back and watch that. Each adventure showed more an more of the One Piece universe and made me fall in love with the crew more and more. Oh and the length, *ahem* Naruto, Bleach, you two have no right to complain anymore!!!!!! I dont want to hear it about the ""We need more fillers to let the manga get farther"" crap. I thoughtr fillers were there to serve that purpose, until i watched One Piece. 478 episodes and only 40 filler! (AT the most!) And its til way behind the manga from wat ive heard! I dont want to hear it anymore Bleach. (already gave up on naruto anime, read manga) Another great thing about One Piece is that it is very ingenuative. In the early episodes of say, Bleach, the characters had special powers and used them to cunningly beat their enemies, like ishida and Rengi's team up against the number 8 espada. But then it turned int okinda just a bunch of ""power battles"" like DBZ where whoever is strongest wins. (btw Bleach is my fav anime so dont think i hate it its just its kinda grating where it is) One Piece, however, has ingenuity all the way through and doesnt rely on just power battles. When Luffy's enemy can read his mind and predict his movements he decides to punch the wall behind him and let his attacks ricochet all over so the enemy cant read it, or Ussop tricking his enemy into unconsciousness when she coudve overpowered him easy. But dont think its just a bunch of weaklings who hav to outsmart everyone, they are strong too! Like the Groggy Ball where sanji and Zoro team up to totally overpower the competition or Luffy's first use of Gear Second. (Still love that) Oh and about that in particular, it doesnt get waterted down the moe he used it. Like in Bleach, Bankai is just another power everyone has and has kinda got watered down, but when Luffy initiated Gear Second you just know its gonna be epic and powerful. The humor was also very welcomed as it seemed to help move the plot along since it was so long. Overall I was very impressed with the series as a whole and cant wait for the new episodes every week. One Piece was the most pleasant surprise thats ever happened to me. Great characters, solid story, uplifting overall atmosphere, epic battles, good humor, it has it all! Im very, very sad that i hav caught up and will now hav to wait every week but i can truely say it has been a fantastic adventure that i will never forget. Arigato, One Piece!

    Where do I begin…? XD I put off this anime for a LONG time, but I seriously regret that now, partially because I now have to catch up -.- but also because… well…I can’t really fault this series at all! XD 
This is my first review so I’ll try cover everything I can think of! And this review will be 100% spoiler free (I’m prone to spoilers myself…) 
NOTE: I watch the FUNimation dub. 
 
Story: If your looking for an anime with a solid plotline your watching the wrong anime. The main point of the series is finding the treasure left by the infamous pirate Gol D. Rogers, the One Piece. However where I am at the moment this has been interrupted by a side mission to help someone, and I’m guessing this is how the story will continue. (Note: I know NONE of the story past where I am now, I don’t read the manga or watch the sub) Despite the randomness of story it’s still brilliant and extremely entertaining, which, let’s face it, is the main point of a story. As for the pirate aspect of the story…I have no interest in pirates (another reason why I put it off), but to be honest Luffy’s crew is not your average pirate crew…to say the least XD 
 
Art: Okay, so THIS is what put me off the series for so long, and looking back at that now I feel slightly embarrassed…I really love the art now! It’s different, unique I guess you might say, which is exactly why I liked anime such as Soul Eater. When I was deciding on whether to watch One Piece or not, I kept coming across forums and people saying “Don’t worry the art improves after a while.” I’ve seen a bit of the “improved” art and to be honest I think I prefer the old one, but that’s just a personal preference I guess. Anyway, anyone reading this DO NOT do what I did and not watch the series because of the art, because you will regret it! XD 
 
Characters: What can I say? Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of this show is the characters. Where I am in the series, there are 6 members in the crew, each one as different as the next. This variety of characters is one of the strongest points of the series. There is BOUND to be someone in the crew that you will love. As for the main protagonist, he’s just as idiotic and loveable as so many other main shounen characters. In fact, he’s probably more idiotic and loveable than all of them combined! You only have to say the name Monkey D. Luffy and I’ll start laughing! To be honest, this show is worth watching just for Luffy…well, him and Zoro maybe ^^” 
 
Sound: I’ve loved all the opening and ending songs so far, and I particularly love how FUNimation dubs them using voice actors (Vic Mignogna singing the first opening definitely helped me to keep watching, not that I really needed any help…) As for the music in the show, I don’t notice it that often, but when I do, it’s very fitting and works well with whatever is happening at the time. Off the top of my head I can think of one example of a song that plays at sad moments and really helps set the mood, it’s a beautiful piece of music. 
 
Enjoyment: This anime is perhaps one of THE best anime in relation to enjoyment. I haven’t found myself being bored once. The other day I found myself watching an episode and when I was finished I realised nothing had happened in it…and I was still so entertained by it! It didn’t fail at one moment to keep my attention. The fights are also brilliant and don’t tend to drag too much (in fact they may be a little short XD) To be honest, there are few other shows that have made me laugh as much as One Piece. 
 
Overall, this anime is a MUST SEE! And what’s brilliant about it is despite it being a mainstream, long running shounen, it has practically no fillers! (And even when it does I find it really hard to differentiate between them and the canon story) Sure, the story drags at points but that’s to be expected from an anime like this, and unlike other series, I don’t notice the drag as much. It’s just too entertaining for that! XD  
 
I would give this series a 9 but looking over my review the only flaw I can find is it drags a little…however I’m not sure about giving it a 10 because of this…so I guess I’ll have to give it a score of 9.5!

    I'm fairly new to One Piece; can't say I carry over that nostalgic feel, but that doesn't mean I don't love it.  
One piece's story is wonderful. It's such a broad idea and can always stay on the main story. There is rarely ever any fillers which is great. 
The fight scenes are awesome too. There's always tension in them, leaving you at the edge of your seat.  
So far (as of episode 351) I hate how no one will die. Everyone seems to live by some wonder or just lives in general despite being hit by something like a bomb millions of times. It's nothing I can't deal with of course, and I've heard it changes later on so I'm anticipating it. 
Personally One Piece is one of my favorites too. I highly recommend this. Even though its 700+ episodes and still going, it's incredibly worth it.

             I love One Piece. Let me start by summarizing the show for the 8 of you on the internet who has no idea what I'm talking about. One Piece is set in a Constructed World (A setting with no connection of any kind to ours in geography or history), where the world is one giant ocean, with some barriers separating it into four seas. It is the Age of Pirates, set off by the death of Gold Roger, and Monkey D. Luffy wants to find the legendary treasure One Piece, therefore becoming the next King of the Pirates. Because he ate one of the Devil Fruits, cursed produce that grant mystical powers to those who consume them, he is made of rubber. He gathers a crew, gets a ship, and fights other pirates. 
 
       Let me start with what is bad, the reason many do not like the show. The animation ranges, but it starts off on the closer end of bad. The dialogue is often cheesy and over the top. The characters, at first glance, are very 2-dimensional and annoying. It constantly breaks science and reason in every way you can possibly imagine. There are several filler arcs, many of which are bad. The original dub by 4kids Entertainment is probably the worst dub of all time, with a lot of unnecessary censorship and terrible casting and writing. It is, I think, the biggest reason for those who do not like it. 
 
      Now for me to gush about what I love. The action is amazing, honestly my favorite from any anime I've seen. The dialogue is over the top, but that's the point. Everything in this show is over-the-top, because that's how it is. The drama, sadness, awesomeness, comedy, and heartwarmingness are all purposely turned up to eleven. That's part of the point. The music, both in show and the openings, are fantastic. And my favorite part is the characters. I said earlier that they can appear 2-dimensional and that's true, from a certain point of view. But once you start paying more attention, the characters have far more depth than you would have though from the silly shonen anime you heard about. Luffy is that ""I'm gonna follow my dreams, eat a lot of food, and get stronger"" kind of protagonist, but then he says stuff that is kinda amazing. ""If I die while trying to reach my dream, then I die."" And he's not blowing smoke out his ass either, at one point when he thinks he will die, he accepts it with a huge grin on his face. The whole cast is like this, and several backstories will make you cry. 
 
     One Piece feels like it was made with a passion, and a message I agree with to a T. It is my shonen anime, and one I shall defend to the grave. Now if only Funimation would catch up on the collections and get back to dubbing the damn thing already!

    One Piece is an excellent show. It's exceedingly funny and I guarantee that you will laugh. The main characters are so weird and insane that you immediately love them.  
 
First there's Monkey D. Luffy, who is this optimistic boy that can stretch his body thanks to a Gum-Gum fruit he ate as a child. He's the captain.  
 
Then there's the sarcastic sword master, Roronoa Zolo, who practices santoryu, which means he uses three swords at once. He is the first mate.  
 
Nami is the third member to join the crew. She's a thief who hates almost all pirates with a passion, but adores money. She's the navigator.  
 
Usopp is the fourth crew member. He's a total scaredy-cat and always tells lies. He's the crew's sharpshooter.  
 
The fifth crewman is Sanji, who's a serious ladies' man. He is the cook.  
 
And then there's Tony Tony Chopper, who is...a reindeer. He's just a tad shy. He's the crew's doctor.  
 
There might be more crew members, but I don't know of any others. They're all really interesting, but the enemies are just absurd. Every time you see a new one you have to stare at it for a minute or so just to figure out whether he's wearing a wig, or if that's REALLY his outfit. The storyline is great and the music makes me smile. Even if you don't obsess over pirates like I do, you will love this show. Sorry there might be some mistake's because, it took a long time to do it and bare my English.

    One Piece, without a doubt is the best anime I have ever watched. You may not have liked the art in the beginning but guys.... it was in 1998. The art develops as the story continues. One Piece is about Monkey D. Luffy, our protagonist who sets out on a adventure to become the Pirate King. One Piece has probably the best story line in the history of anime. Each islands Luffy and his crew visits are filled with amazing detail and creativity. One Piece truly is the best anime/manga i have ever watched/read.

    Now this anime now this anime, I was very hesitant about first cos I am a bleach maniac and love naruto loads, so I was like I wont like this. Now how wrong was I , well I started watching it ye its really slow at the start, very very slow. But later on it gets amazing. The characters in One Piece are top class, they just are so well developed with such good back stories. On to the actual story its really good well made well plotted, ok there are fillers loads of them but hey these fillers are pretty good. Characters like Smoker Zorro Robbin are all characters who develop excellently through the anime. Art I did not like much at the start, but later on it gets better. Sound is awesome music is awesome some very very tense moments. Enjoyment a full 10 because its so good. Overall I'd give it a 9 Im still watching it at the moment at episode 430 its so good do not miss it, Bleach number 1 one piece number 2 and gintama 3 and naruto 4 for me lol.

    Though some may be drawn away by the length of One Piece or the fan base, I decided to give it a try. Having liked the episodes shown on Cartoon Network as a kid, One Piece was always a name familiar to me. This series is outstanding. It is a bit slow moving at first, but it picks up tremendously. The character development is outstanding, and you really feel like you are right there with the characters. Through times of happiness and sorrow, you are moved by the characters and grow near personal bonds with them. The story grabs you in and it feels like you are in a completely different world while you are watching. This is a must see for any anime fan.

                                  One Piece. The Treasure Of Shounen Anime? 
One Piece is a PG 13 tale of adventure and comedy. It has been around since 1999 and the author said it is only half way done. It's no surprise this anime is in the top big 3! 
 
The One Piece story is a simple story about a kid named  Monkey D Luffy with a dream to become the Pirate King and to obtain the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. The first couple of arcs is basically getting his powerful, witty crew together. Usually when an anime is introducing main characters there is little action, but not in the case of this one. Whether he had one partner or five The Straw Hat Crew (Luffy's Crew) always managed to stay in trouble. This anime is not just about it's action or wise crack moments, but it also get intense and will have you in tears (personal experience) as more of the story and mystery unravels. 
 
The art of this show throws some people off because it is not like the usually anime style, but looks cartoonish. I love the art and actually a lot of shows before the 2000's especially in the 70's and 80's looked like One Piece. I think it's art gives it unique style an easily distinguished it from the rest. 
 
The sound is where I have mixed views. If you watched this is dub I am so sorry and I know how you are skeptical of watching this show, but that was 4Kids dub. They chopped up the anime and made the voices younger like so it would appeal to kids. That is why I recommend skipping dub all together in this anime. Even the FUNimation dubbed is not finished and not worth watching. Please watch this anime in sub to get a taste of what the anime is really supposed to be like. Besides the Voice Actors do a splendid job. As for theme music I missed the first opening. I felt it went really well with the pirate them. I like the other openings as songs, but it really doesn't fit the adventure mood. 
 
The characters are something else. They are cliched yet not cliche and it's really hard to explain. I do not want to spoil it so I will only tell you that the characters each have their own special personality and this show works a great deal of showing their backgrounds. Even minor characters are not neglected in the show and you grow to love them like you grow to love the main characters. 
 
Overall I loved this anime and I recommend it to a person who loves to laugh, cry, and be overwhelmed with other emotions through the long ride.

    Let’s talk about One Piece. 
 
Now, why would anyone in their right mind watch, as of this review, 588 episodes -- 8 days of their life (if you watch 24 hours a day) -- on one anime which shows no signs of ending anytime in the next 10 years? In my humble opinion: because One Piece is the paramount serial anime series on the planet. I cannot imagine any other series captivating my attention from the first episode and holding it for so long. There are always new and exciting things to discover, and the stories of each crew member will make you love them for all eternity. Other crew members aside, Luffy is the reason this show is so amazing; he is the greatest main character in any series. His funny and light attitude makes the show enormously entertaining, and it contrasts and intensifies his strong emotions when he truly gets serious. Of course, the fight scenes are amazing and seeing new devil’s fruits or new techniques (especially some around the halfway mark :D ), will make your heart soar with excitement. The way that Oda (writer of the original manga) has created a world where the crew can go into any environment and find any enemy with any power, while still progressing the story, is complete genius. I have laughed, cried and jumped for joy while watching this show and I won’t be stopping anytime soon.  
 
But beware; once you start you won’t be able to stop. Plan accordingly. 10/10

    My favorite anime, one I cherish more than any other, one helped me tot realize my one and only wish. Being real good people, being with real good people, treasuring them and having a beautiful friendship is what I have always dreamed of, in other words. Each character, each episode is my treasure. As I am watching them, I find happiness. When they are happy I become happy, to see them being happy. And I feel sorry when they feel so.  
This is why I One Piece this much. 
Respecting anyone's own taste and liking I don't have a right to criticize anybody as well. I am fully aware of for anybody's taste and liking this anime might be cheesy, never-ending and exaggerated.

    I'd like to start by saying that I don't have many gripes with One Piece's story. The rating that I have given it is not a reflection of any flaws with the story, but instead a product of several other factors. 
 
I might also add that I do read the manga, which doesn't suffer from the same problems as the anime. I rather enjoy it, and I do recommend it. 
 
The anime, though, is a different story altogether. 
 
Since we've already established that I like the story, we'll start with the quality of the art. 
 
When I first began watching One Piece, I quickly fell in love with the art. Some people detested it, but it was a bit of a hook for me. 
 
Then, suddenly, after years of tuning in, I began to notice that the animation was a far cry from what it was when I was new to the world of One Piece. 
 
While artistic changes aren't necessarily bad, the types of changes that I noticed certainly were: less detail, more generic designs for some characters, terribly animated scenes. 
 
Admittedly, if the art was the only problem, the show would be at least bearable. Unfortunately, however, that is not the case; the pacing is even more horrendous than the animation, though it wasn't always so. 
 
As a matter of fact, the show's pacing was the nail in the coffin for me; it makes me (and many other viewers) wish that the studio would just throw in some fillers just to put some distance between the manga and the anime. 
 
To be blunt, so little happens in each episode that I sometimes wonder why the episodes are 23 to 24 minutes in length.  
 
The typical structure of an episode is as follows: 3.5 minute opening, 3 minute recap of the last episode, 7 minutes of "" new content"" (which consists of maybe 4 minutes of actual new content and 3 minutes of pointless reaction shots and overused flashbacks, and I'm being generous here), a 30 second mid-episode break, 8 minutes of some more content which follows nearly the same pattern as the pre-break material, and a 30 second preview of the next episode. 
 
I hope that all adds up to 23 or 24 minutes. 
 
Not like it matters. 
 
The studio clearly doesn't care about producing decent content, so why should I care about carefully estimating the amount of new material that is introduced per episode? 
 
Regardless of what I've written here, I must admit that I will not stop watching One Piece. True, I occasionally fall behind on the anime (as I have now), but I've been watching it for too many years to just give up on it now. 
 
I don't put this kind of time in so that I can quit halfway through. 
 
I'm pretty sure that very few people do, which is probably why this anime still has any viewers at all.

    A great anime that you have to see! When it comes to long-term anime is a piece for me by far at the top. That Oda has created this is simply the madness. Although it is the shortest in comparison to many short anime series, it has an incredible value for the enormous size.. 
Countless characters with intense backgrounds. Over the years, a gigantic universe has built up. In doing so, everything is handmade, and only the coherent and self-sufficient picture. Only the Filler sequences are also exaggerated. The same gilded for the often senseless stretching of the anime. But these are almost the only criticisms I have here.

One Piece is one of the biggest anime and manga out there, not just in length, but also in popularity, now popularity is not a good way to proof quality, but when the source manga is not only THE most sold manga in the world with over 100mil more sales than the number 2 most sold manga but its also THE most sold COMIC in the world by a single author and it got a record in the Guinness book, beside manga sales its also one of the most popular anime even here on mal at number 32 and 4 in most favourites, its also one of the most talked about show in youtube, with many big anime youtubers being fans of it, like Gigguk, chibi and even someone who is more critical like thatanimesnob said it was actually pretty good at some point, and again I know that popularity doesn't equal quality, but when a show is THIS popular, you can at least fairly say its does somethings good.  
 
over the years the show's quality has changed a lot, and not in a linear fashion where it kept getting better or kept getting worse, it just went up and down in quality a lot, to the point that if I had to rate each arc differently some would get as high as a 10 and some would get as low as a 5. 
The Good : 
 
1- If you look at the genres for One Piece in MAL you'll see :  Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Shounen, Super Power 
 
and I have to say one piece does all of these genres very very well. 
 
Action : the fights in one piece aren't that frequent with the story more focused around other things, but when they do happen they are very well done and there many different types of fights, you have some fights that are centred around raw power or some that use tactics and brains, and every fight has a lot of meaning behind it, in a sense that the stakes are high and what the characters had to do to reach that fight was a lot, basically the author really knows how to hype up fights before they happen.  
 
Adventure/Fantasy : the is probably one of the best thing about one piece, I've met many different kinds of people who've watched the show and one thing they always praise -even if they hated most other things- is the world building and the adventure in it, the world in one piece is HUGE with many island that each have their own kind of twist, a lot of different factions from pirates to world government to underworld workers to kings and leaders of the islands, almost every type of mythical creature there is, from mermaids, fishmen and dwarfs to giants, dragons, undead and talking animal people ( and much more ), and experiencing all of these islands gives a really nice sense of adventure, and the world is also very well connected, for example one character from the early episodes ends up being in an important character in an arc 500 episodes later.  
 
Comedy : this one is different to each person but I found the comedy in one piece hilarious and has really good delivery and timing, I'd link you some funny moments but its hard to understand it in its own without having an idea about the characters.  
 
Drama : its hard to go into this one without too much spoilers but I can say that one piece has affected me emotionally with its many tearjerking moments, even ones that you'd never expect.  
 
Superpowers : Superpowers in one piece can be very simple or very creative and interesting, but even the simple ones can be made creative with how the characters use them.  
 
Now MAL doesn't say One Piece has Mystery, but I'd say it does, Oda (the aurhtor) also leaves a lot of hints and forshadowing in many parts of the story and its why there are a bunch of one piece theories out there, I mean just search "" one piece theory"" on youtube and see how many results you get. 
and the ways these mysteries are revealed are also pretty good, not in an asspull kind of way but in way that will make you go "" whhaaat! so thats what happened!"" 
 
2- One Piece has some of my favourites Soundtracks that are really effective in doing what they are trying to do, whether its for building hype or making the viewer emotional. 
 
3- The characters are also a great part of one piece, with many of them having really awesome designs, interesting/emotional backstory, and each have their own goals and ideologies. 
 
Our main crew in particular is really great, seeing their interactions with each other is surprisingly one of my favourite things about the show, they are all interesting in their own ways. 
 
The Bad :  
 
Just like my ratings indicates, One Piece has a lot of problems and even someone who loves one piece like me can see them. 
 
1- For starters the animation is pretty bad overall, it changes over the course of the show, some parts its Sakuga level but most of the time its pretty bad, especially compared to today's standards.  
  
2- while I did say the soundtracks are usually great, the recent episodes haven't really been using great soundtracks, sometimes the SFXs are all over the place, The voice acting for the most part is pretty good and I have no problem with it, but its nothing mindblowing. 
 
3- the pacing of the anime is very very slow, the manga has 870 chapters ( as of right now ) and the anime has 798 episodes, just by looking at those numbers alone you can tell just how slow it is, with the recent 200 something episodes only adapting one chapter OR LESS per episode which is just crazy slow, one piece the manga is already slow enough at some parts but the anime just made it really terrible, there are also always about 5 minutes spent on recaps+opening. however that is not always the case, while the early episodes also had slow pace, its wasn't nearly as bad as now, and it was a very minor problem, which is why I kept watching the show and didnt drop it. 
 
4- Being repetitive is another one of One Piece's problems, however this one is minor, because while every arc has core elements that happen in ever other arc, for the most part its still a fresh new arc and these core elements are done in a slightly different way.  
 
5- Asspulls, One Piece doesn't have many of those but it still does have them and its a problem, fortunately though, when it does happen its in the arcs that are considered one of the better arcs ( because of other things of course ) and so this problem is overshadowed. 
 
6- some parts are pretty much useless and the show would be a lot better without them.  
 
Overall I'd say for sure give One Piece a chance, and keep going until you just cant watch it anymore, if you reach that point before episode 500 then well I guess its not for you, if you reach it after, then I'd say move over to the manga and give it a try, its worth it.  
 
 
 
And thats about it, I hope you found my review helpful, I apologise for any English mistakes I had (English is not my first language) 
 
I wasn't going to write a review but I noticed the reviews for one piece are either all 10s or all 5 or below, and I found both to be ridiculous, so I decided to write my own review.

    I once Loved One Piece, It used to be great... YEARS ago and I'll play Morpheus here before I start the review. 
 
If you want to stay in the illusion that One Piece is the best of greatest animes of all times, let it go, dont read my review. 
If you wanna know why the series is saturated already, keep reading at your own risk, you have been warned: 
 
1- No ONE. EVER. DIES. - It doesn't matter what is happening, if it is a bullet, cannon ball, knife, sword, atomic bomb, war, no one in the series ever dies, Oda only gives you the illusion that the character died to show moments later that everyone is ok. 
 
2- Flashback Kills - This one is contraditory to my first argument, but to dont say that oda never kills, he'll enjoy doing that in flashbacks, in the actual arc be relaxed, no one will die, but in flashbacks? be sure that someone will die. 
 
3- ""Hey, Ace and White Beard Died"" - Yes my Friend, and he made an entire arc for that to happen and who else died without being in a flashback, entire wars and civil wars happened, where EVERYONE got just bruises and scars... 
 
4- Civil Wars : EVERY ISLAND, EVERY SINGLE INSLAND, they face a civil war, one way or another, the population of the island fight, it doesnt matter the reason, they'll just fight. 
 
5- Random Mystery to be solved: Oda tends to throw mysteries around the series, just to solve them 100 chapters later, but it is not like lost, he doesnt give you hints about it, he just throw the mystery, and throw what it means, simple as that, but if you wanna know, keep watching for the next 2 years. 
 
6- Moar Boobs: By the past years, the female boobs is just increasing, while his creativity is diminishing. He is basically throwing random fan-service to keep audience. 
 
7- Hidden Royal Familly Seeking Something: Somehow the Crew will reach an island, and if that island have a monarchy, be sure that the king is overthrown and they will meet the princess and the king in coincidencial circunstances. 
 
8- Secret Organizations: I lost the count how many shady characters and secret organizations appeared, they are always the all powerfull, just to appear another one more all powerfull than before. 
 
9- Epic Moments: At the end of each arc, Oda tends to do something unexpected, and THAT where is his MASTER TRAP is, every arc, usually ends with luffy or someone from the crew doing something amazing or really unexpected, remember when I said about Ace and White Beard Death? That is Shocking, happened at the end of the arc, Goind Merry Being Burned? End of The Arc, Luffy Burning the Marine Flag? hum... And now that the trap is laid, the audience wants to see more, so he dont need to be deep, so shallow plots and characters are just enough, as long as he can keep giving them what they want. 
 
And that's basically his formulae, and it works pretty well, he doesn't change it, people like repetition, Fairy Tail is also a ""success"" so... if you give people simple fights with Power Ups never seen before, boobs floating, Epic Moments at the end, Rinse and repeat, success, One piece is doing that with maestry in his last years, Fairy Tail do that since the beggining, and Naruto do that Since the end of the Genin Tournament. This is Basically the Formuale of all those non ending series.

    Ok. This one is going to be a tough cookie. :| 
 
I will get this out of the way first. I may be slightly biased to One Piece but I have seen at least 70-100 episodes of other long series, Naruto and Bleach being 2 of them, I watched these 3 simultaneously, bad idea I know, but I was recommended Naruto and Bleach from a friend. So why did I watch One Piece you ask? Because no one else had is not the correct answer but pretty close. I wanted something for myself. A series I could devote my time to which I would enjoy. So a year or more ago I started the long grind and as I write this review I am at episode 717 and have seen a lot of the movies, at least 6-7 of them. 
 
This gets me onto my main point. I did say I watched all 3 simultaneously but that is kind of a lie. I watched Naruto and Bleach BEFORE I watched One Piece but dropped them for various reasons, Naruto got boring for me after 70 episodes (I know the second half is better and I will get around to it but smh) and Bleach was pretty good but I just couldn't get into it, I would get bored and stop then rewatch etc. (Like what happened with Fairy Tail). 
 
This now brings me to One Piece. This is the only long show, or any show in general, that I have never gotten bored of. A whole year I have been addicted to it when most other shows I watch for a week, or possibly only a few days, and then drop. The beginning is good, not amazing, but good enough to get you into it but once you get past the beginning few episodes. DAMN. This shit gud. 
 
Now I will get onto some stuff about the actual show. 
 
Art- 7/10 
It's Toei they can't draw for shit and this is the biggest, possibly only (for me), flaw in the show. Some episodes look really good and then some *cough*THEENTIREDRESSROSAARC*cough* don't look very go...od... 
Moving on... 
 
Story 8/10 
Simple. It's so simple that you get used to it then BAM. Something happens that makes you cry into your pillow, which no other long show has done for me. Stuff that you thought was irrelevant makes you cry. 
Simple, good, can't get confused *COUGH* but a little repetitive if you are into your story stuff. IF yuo are watching for entertainment you won't care. I mean look at Gintama it has one of the highest ratings ever but doesn't really have a story. 
My fav arcs are... 
 
1. Enies Lobby/Marineford 
2. Punk Hazard 
3. Fishman Island/Return To Sabaody Archipelago 
 
My fav film is Strong World 
 
Sound 10/10 
Hmmm... Some will DEFINITELY disagree but One Piece openings, endings (The few we had) and background music all fits perfectly in there respected place. 'We Go' after the timeskip was a really nice one since they had been waiting 2 years to adventure and then a really loud and upbeat song came on to show that. 
From the background music, which doesn't change much, to the openings they are all really good. 
My favs are... 
 
OP- 14/11 
ED- 11/15 
 
Characters 10/10 
This is the backbones of the series. So many characters that I want to learn about. Backstory on pretty much anyone gives you an opportunity to award empathy to a villain whereas most series just tell you that this guy is bad and not to like them. One Piece let's you choose if they are right or wrong. All of the crew members are good. None are annoying and I love all of them. I don't want to say anymore just know that all of the characters are really good, apart from Buffalo FFFFFF, so yeah please take a look. 
My favs are... 
 
Luffy, Jinbe, Zoro and a lot of other people but this list would go on forever :( 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
From the emotions to the comedy to the story to the character development to ASL :'(. I love it all. One Piece is the only series, for me, that can make me laugh, cry and want to know what happens next episode so bad I can't wait. Nothing else does this for me and that is why I am going to give One Piece a... (insert drum role)

    Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, a twelve year old girl (me) was new to Anime, and wanted to get into it. She stumbled across One Piece, and since she had nothing better to do, she binged watched it and absolutely adored it. 
 
But, then the fanbase started to get pretty violent, and the episodes airing at the time were dragging out a bit too long, so she decided to drop it for a while.  
 
During the year while she was gone, she discovered different Anime. Shows she actually enjoyed more than One Piece. And thus, returning to One Piece after the fandom had calmed down, after watching new shows that were mature and moving, she realized something she never knew. 
 
This show sucks. It sucks really bad. 
 
Story: 
Every cliche shounen show you can name. No really, just think about any shounen anime, and the first things that come into your mind are there. We've got the childish idiotic protagonists, we've got the overly eccentric girl who hits said protagonists because he's stupid, we've got the dark broody badass with a heart of gold, you can pretty much name everything that's going to happen before it happens. 
 
Art/Animation: 
The animation for the first 100 episodes was fine, for the most part. But in the newer episodes, it just looks so glossy and lazy. It actually hurts my eyes. 
 
Sound: 
The music is fantastic. Really, just get the soundtrack for this thing, it's the only thing that's worth it. 
 
Character: 
Very, very poor. Everyone's just your stereotypical Dragon Ball rip-off. Luffy = Goku, Nami = Bulma, Zoro = Piccolo, Sanji = Vegeta, Usopp = Krillin, Chopper = Chiaotzu, Robin = #18, ect.  
 
Enjoyment: 
None. It was enjoyable up to the Arlong Park arc. After that, it just got boring. Each episode is 20 minutes, and they waste most of that time with themesongs and recapping of the show's plot, and the previous episode. And the time that they do spend is wasted on filler, and the characters just standing around and talking. WHY THE FUCK DID I EVER LIKE THIS SHIT!!?????? 
 
Overall: 
Why am I giving this a 5 when I just tore it apart? Well, I do kind of still have a soft spot for it, as it used to be my favorite show, and it was what introduced me to Anime. And I used to like it because I was, like, 12, and I hadn't seen too many Anime at the time. So, if you have a 12 year old kid with you, show it to them if they wanna see something, it's harmless. Or, if you're new to Anime and you wanna see a shounen show, then go ahead and check it out if you want. It's harmless enough. 
 
But really, the only reason this show is so popular is because its fanbase is just a bunch of twelve year olds who like cliche shounen stuff, and 21-year-olds who're just as immature as the kids. Believe me, I've been in this fanbase. So, just get up to the Arlong Park arc, and just stop. Trust me, it's not worth it. 
 
If you want something original that's mature and relatable, instead of childish and tossing in backstories that's just a bunch of people dying, then I'd suggest giving it a skip.

    I enjoyed early One Piece, the story had me hooked and I would binge as many episodes as I could in a day. That said recently One Piece has begun to really slow down in their stories. Each episode from the Fishman Arc onwards only really has about 10 minutes of new content and a lot of that is looping animations to pad run time. Once it got to the Big Mom Arc I started to notice the extreme drop in animation quality as well. Because of this slow pacing and excessive drop in quality it is hard for me to even watch a single episode now.  
 
Early One Piece for me was a joy, but the post-Fishman Arcs are just so slow and poorly animated it becomes hard to watch after a while.

    One piece review! (as of episode 710) =SPOILERS CONTAINED= 
 
- Synopsis - 
 
      To this day Luffy, A little boy who ate the Gum-Gum fruit is on an adventure to find the one piece! A show centered around its amazing characters, and amazing world building, I feel it deserves my time for a review! This show, on where I am currently standing is at 710 of 851 episodes. My name is Seigyoku, and this is my thoughts on one piece! 
 
-plot/story- 
8/10 
 
The story is about a boy, named Luffy who had grown up with his brothers Ace and Sabo with a bandit mountain gang. Sometime after Luffy has decided to start his journey as a pirate! He has met many friends along the way.  
     
     The story is undoubtedly fantastic, the show gives me a sense of adventure and I feel like I'm with Luffy all the way on this journey. An example of this is when Luffy comes to the arlong park arc. When I first started this arc, it didn't impact me at first, but later in the story during the Fishman Island arc, it amazed me on how far ahead the story could be planned. it takes skill to be able to organize a chronological story while managing it on a weekly manga basis. 
 
as for the backstory arcs, they are worthwhile, rich with a story it leaves you satisfied on knowing the events of what happened. I'd say an amazing backstory example is Law's backstory. It showed how much it can change a person, it felt like I was suffering with Law during the whole thing. On the back of Law's coat that he wears, it says the person name who saved him, which is amazing. it leaves me speechless to know everything has a meaning in this show, and the plot is just about perfect. 
 
- characters - 
9/10 
 
This anime does characters in a unique way, that makes it stand out from other shows. This being a long-running shounen series, It gives the opportunity to build characters up, and make you really attached to them. A good example would be Usopp on the arc of Water 7 Island. The arc was mainly focused around Robin, but even other characters were brimming with rich interaction with the story. Usopp loved the ship of the straw hat pirates it was from his hometown built by one of his most loved. I could feel the pain from Usopp when he reacted to the news of the ship being unsalvagable. He had pride with the ship, and when he heard Luffy's decision his pride and love for the ship made the two have a serious clash which was the highlight of the water 7 arc in my opinion. 
 
Usopp is my favorite character because he used to be such a self-doubting person, and that's why he lied most of the time, to cover that up. In the show, he learns to overcome that self-doubt during that arc. He thinks back on the mistakes he has made and wants to fix them, and it shows that he has matured a lot, he still is cowardly, yes that's just his nature. 
 
-Art/Animation- 
6/10 
 
 
Now, this is probably my most liked part of the entire show, I apologize to the hardcore fans. This show was demanded on a weekly basis, so I can see why it was struggling with consistency on the animation subject. It just felt like I was looking at a painting sometimes if you want an analogy. Which somewhat threw off the immersive feeling of the show.  
 
Not all apples are rotten, there were some amazing scenes, such as mihawk slicing a massive ship clean in half it had so much detail in the scene I couldn't keep my eyes still, but for the majority of the show, it was lacking in some aspects.  
 
Now as for the art, it was unique in some arcs, I really liked the look of marineford, it had this feeling that it had the embodiment of the safety of the world and it had such an interesting design. The fact that there were so many characters it was amazing on how consistent the art stayed natural, even less significant characters looked good. 
 
-music- 
7/10 
 
The music was pretty darn good. The walk to Franky house and hearing that song of the straw hat pirates literally doubled the adrenaline and excitement I was feeling, and some of the soundtracks that really gave it that vibe of it being a monumental event. The death of whitebeard gives me chills when they were naming the casualties and the music that was playing helped with that a lot. So yeah the music was a good impact on the immersive feeling of the show. 
 
-final thoughts- 
overall score: 8/10 
 
I do not regret watching this show, it was worth the time, and thank you Toei animation for orchestrating such a masterpiece, the world loves you for all the joy you have brought to the anime community, this is seigyoku, and this has been my review on one piece, Sayanora!

    I give this anime a 3. I tried watching and watching this show but no, it doesn't work. Find it way to childish. I believe people can find it enjoying to watch when they just want to disconnect sometimes but there is nothing in this show which makes it deserve a 8.3 in rating.  
 
I can explain 1 of many scenes why i find this too silly and the fights boring. There is one fight in the early episodes when they fight a clown pirate ""Buggy"". A cannon gets loaded, Zoro flips it so it is pointed towards the pirates (they are like 2 meter away). For 5 seconds they just stand there like in old cartoons, not moving and then gets shot. There is maaany more silly fights which aren't even fun to watch. 
 
If you are looking for a Adventure anime aimed for more grown up people then watch Hunter x Hunter. Full metal alchemist is all right as well.

    There are many reviewers on this site who criticize this anime. The one thing I Don't get is that all those reviews have the one and the same thing written in them, i.e It is too long, 700 episodes and counting, don't waste time, more than 200 hours, etc... I would say F*@k all of them, Watch this anime because it is fun, it has great story, characters (except for Nami), Unique art and is enjoyable. If you don't like long anime's don't watch it. it is simple as that. But bashing this anime jus because it is long is not called anime reviewing it is just complaining. The world building in one piece is just awesome, Because of such a big world there are many possibilities of storyline. One piece should be watched arc wise, complete one arc and then leave the anime and then watch another arc after 2 - 3 weeks, it is alright. I am here to tell everyone that those people who go on and on about one piece being bad because of the length are just whiny b*tches, Who wants to get on the hate train because it is a ""TREND"".  
 
Watch this anime it is good 8/10.

    This is a great series (in some areas), and i've found it to be very lovable to many people. The art is very smooth and emotion full, and the characters are, though generally doll, enjoyable. 
One of the only thing dragging this down, is the fact that they've made such a rich number of episodes, that its retarded. Should be cut down to 100 or less, and just end the whole thing soon.  
If they, sometime, decide to do so, ill get my ass back into that series.

    Ok I'm going to try and keep this short.  
 
At the time of this review (episode 759)  
 
Story: amazing. Indepth. All of it seems to be connected. If I were to complain it's that the story can seem repetitive from arc to arc. Another good thing about this anime story is that after looking back at the arcs I found that I enjoyed the filler arcs the most.  
 
There is an art style downgrade from after the time skip that is pretty bad considering what art we have today in anime 
 
Another thing that started idiot aging me post time skip was the incidental music. I mean for 400 episodes it's alright but  by the dressrosa arc I was kind of sick of it.  
 
Anyway if you are new to this series or contemplating weather or not to watch, it's long as hell and only getting longer but it was well worth my time.

    Before i start the review need to say...thank you Eiichiro Oda for create the best anime/manga i've ever seen. 
 
One Piece is a HUGE shonen that was created by eiichiro oda in 1997 and the anime is produced by Toei Animation since 1999. And yes, it STILL making much sucess all around the world. 
 
The curious thing is that Oda planned to One Piece last only 5 years, but the anime has 15 years and the manga 17. And he said that the manga reached the middle last year. Yeah. 
 
The first time i saw One Piece, i was 7 and i remember that i liked it very much. But only 8 years later i started to follow the anime. I started in January, and ""finished"" today, May. Now, I can certainly say what i think about the anime. 
 
Story (10) 
 
At the beginning of OP, the story seems to be poor and cheap. You think like: "" Oh, pirates. He wants to be a king? Oh stop"". But when you get to the episode 60 you can't stop watching. All the story is connected, nothing is in vain. Remember that. Eiichiro is a tricky person. 
 
Art (8) 
 
I like the simple and crazy way that Oda draws. But you know, the grafics are not the best, and the anime is old, so you need to be patient at the beginning of the story. 
 
Sound (9) 
 
I LOVE the ost of One Piece. It feets perfectly with the scenes and the characters. 
 
Character (10) 
 
Each character has you own personality, and this make they special. They are very diferent and funny, but each of them cares a lot with the others. This is the magic of One Piece. Actually,they all are very weird people, with stranges faces, colors, forms and mostly laughs. Yes, in One Piece all the laughs (mostly in the villans) are very very weird. I almost broke my computer once because i hadn't had patient to hear the Moria's laugh 14 times in a episode. 
 
Overall (10) 
 
Ok, you definitely should watch One Piece. Is an epic anime that teaches you to never give up and always protect your friends. If you have never watched, you don't know what is live. And if you don't want to see...errr you gonna see it anyway xx
