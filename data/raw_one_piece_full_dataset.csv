"First review (7/25/16). This movie is great and just miraculously outstanding. Eichiro Oda never fails to deliver beauty in art to his audience. The music is fantastic thanks to the music staff that put their soul into the making . The colors are just so sharp,crispy and delicious. The story is fantastic as always expected from the most popular mangaka of all time. 4 Dimensional Experience is legitimately the best experience. Watching this movie on the day of its release was like a dream come true. I am a pirate but these are better pirates if you get what I mean. What to expect: Luffy (Gear 4) RoronoaZoro (air swoosh)",False,anime_review,31490,2016-07-25T17:41:00+00:00
"I am a big fan of One Piece, have always been and as a fan this movie is a must watch, not because it is canon but because it might be one of the best One Piece movies. In fact, i think it is the second best One Piece movie right after Strong World. I am not a japanese speaker but i had the luck to be able to watch it in the theaters in japan right after it came out. It was a highly entertaining movie, and just about as good as a non canon movie can be. I don't think this is a movie exceptionallygood for someone who doesn't know the main story already, but i went to see it with people that are not into the One piece universe and they liked it very much too.

What might be considered the worst part of the movie are the villains, Tesoro is fine as a main villain but his ""crew"" was really lackluster unfortunately. Due to the high number of the main cast (straw hats) it was impossible to give every one of them a super important role. The ones who where lacking in this movie where brook and chopper mostly.

This movie focuses mostly on Nami, Luffy and Franky which was a very good surprise. I also loved one of the characters from Tesoro's crew, Carina was the highlight of the movie for me.

This movie had a fair share of entertaining plot twists and also a very good setting.

Finally Toei gave One Piece the animation quality it deserves with some beautiful fights throughout the entire movie. The sound for me in the cinema was too loud, which was a detriment to the show especially during the start of the movie and at the end, with explosions that where both capable of destroying ships as much as they where able to destroy my ears capability of hearing.

Overall a must watch for One Piece fans, it was such a joy to watch, especially with the huge amount of references to the main series. If you are not a One piece fan i also recommend this movie because it is very entertaining even though you might feel a bit lost with the terminology like Haki, Devil fruits, Awakening.

My Overall score for this movie is a 7, this does not mean that it was a bad movie by any means, in fact this means its a highly recommendable movie. As i said previously if you are a fan of the series you are gonna absolutely LOVE this movie.

Absolutely worth the 15$ i had to pay for my ticket to the cinema.",False,anime_review,31490,2016-08-04T09:11:00+00:00
"One Piece Film: Gold is the third modern One Piece movie and the second post timeskip. At this point the formula for a One Piece movie has been set in stone, and it is most efficient to evaluate the film based on how it meets expectations. From an aesthetic perspective the movie is basically flawless. The animation is gorgeous, the character designs are on point, and every costume change the case goes through is exciting and memorable. The film-exclusive character is far more memorable than most of her predecessors as she is an old girlfri- I mean accomplice of Nami's from her cat burglar days, andtheir dynamic is simple but effective. Getting the One Piece cast to do a heist film is inherently interesting given how batshit insane the characters are, and the genre-standard twists are handled well. There is a particular sub-twist that makes perfect sense in universe that was both inspired and hilarious.

The movie isn't flawless character wise. Like most OP movies the characterization is slightly off. Nami, despite having ample screen time, never comments on the fact that the kids enslaved by the casino are basically in the same situation she was in for a decade. Luffy seems unusually apathetic when a crewmate is placed in danger in the first act. Nothing is egregious, but it is enough to take notice. As for most modern OP films some characters are included for no reason other than to have them in marketing material. Still have no idea what Sabo and Lucci were doing. The gambler character introduced serves no particular purpose and just drags down the movie in the middle.

The main villain is compelling ideologically, but never gets quite enough attention to make sense. His devil fruit is busted to the point it is completely unbelievable, and the main confrontation between him and Luffy suffers as a result. Cool idea, but not enough spice to make him memorable.

Its a good One Piece experience, but outside the outfits and nice cuts of animation provides nothing to remember it by.

Score: Strong 6 to a Light 7",False,anime_review,31490,2021-01-08T22:12:00+00:00
"This is far better than most of the movies I have recently seen. Trust me, I know what I'm saying. Even though I pay most of the attention to the story and music, all the elements of the story contributed to extremely outstanding time I had watching this movie. Because Film Gold is everything that a good Vegas - style movie should have - a thrill, respectful villain, and this outstanding music that deepens the entire experience. And Film Gold is packed with goodies since the very beginning, when the Strawhats arrive at Gran Tesoro. The giant show, incredible battle sequences (oh yes! Gold has the bestfight scenes EVER!), the design of the golden city, giant race, the long - gone characters that we all craved to see on the screen since they were announced to appear... 

In fact, the only thing I didn't like that much were the voices of Carina and Baccarat. They didn't match the characters at all, especially Baccarat, who spoke in a very flegmatic, annoying way. I also hoped that Carina would sing something, since she was supposed to be Gran Tesoro's singing queen. Gild Tesoro's inspirational and moving flashbacks also were given too little time, which I guess would be welcomed with open arms by the most of the audience.

Nevertheless, One Piece: Film GOLD is a masterpiece and a crown jewel of entire OP franchise. If you want to see it, definitely do it in the cinema! It's one of those outstanding movies that should be viewed only there... You won't regret.",False,anime_review,31490,2016-08-02T01:03:00+00:00
"Story- Generic and Bad. characters- Every new character is horrible, poorly fleshed out and annoying with awful motives. Art/sound- Art was to be expected of a high movie budget toei onepiece film, and the sound was passable aswell. It was jazzy and bombastic fitting for the casino setting. Overall- only gets up to a 2 because of one man of principal. Sgt Straight. The only reason i stuck with this movie to the bitter end. As a Fellow man of principal I cannot recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys quality anime. RIP.

"The amount of advertising and hype leading up to this film rivals that of Strong World. Since Oda gave his stamp of approval (as well as being the executive producer) the fans had high expectations for Film: Gold. The Straw Hat pirates visit a large ship / city on the ocean known as Gran Tesoro but things take a turn when one of the members of the crew is captured and set to be executed. Story: 7 The story, while interesting, felt like it was lacking at times. Certain parts felt rather rushed while others seemed as if they were dragging on. The first 30 minutesor so were probably my least favourite of the movie. The scenery of Gran Tesoro is beautiful but the number of times the camera pans around buildings and streets starts to feel like an extended 3D tour of the city rather than relate to the plot. 
Starting about 30 minutes in is when the story actually takes off and for the most part it's well written. If you know One Piece, you know what to expect. The plot doesn't deviate from the standard One Piece storytelling or take any major risks. I see this as both a plus and a minus. It's /good/ that the writers of the movie didn't try anything new or crazy that might conflict with the overall story and characters of One Piece, but the /bad/ is that the film is very predictable because it follows an extremely familiar story structure. 

There were also a few times that things felt out of place. For example, about an hour into the movie there is a sequence when the Straw Hats are breaking up into teams (as they often do) and the whole thing felt like a video game cut scene. While it was artsy and cool to look at, the whole thing was a bit random to me. 
Speaking of breaking into teams; one of the best highlights of this movie for me was Luffy and Franky teaming up. Off the top of my head I can't recall that happening recently, but it worked really well for the film. Had a few good laughs in the scenes with the two of them. 

Truly the last half of this film is what brought this movie from 'ok' to 'good' in my honest opinion. I personally didn't much care for the first few parts with seemingly random car chases and gambling, but once Luffy and the Straw Hats face off Tesoro the first time is when things start to get interesting, and then later when splitting into teams is when everything gets exciting. 

Art: 9
As it is with most One Piece movies, especially in recent years, the art is spectacular. Lots of effort put into the visuals, the sets, and even the clothes... the Straw Hats make at least 3 major wardrobe changes in this film!
The animation is much smoother and more detailed than what we see in the anime, and during the fight sequences is when the animation really shines. For example, we haven't seen Gear Fourth used in a film with a high budget up until this point, and (though it was short lived) it looked great. 

Like I mentioned before, the scenes at the start with them going through the city and all the pan shots felt weird, but that's really the only downside to the art that I could see. 

Sound: 10
The voice acting was just as good as I wanted it to be; there was heart and effort in their deliveries and I couldn't have asked for more. What should be talked about as well as the voice acting is the soundtrack.
The music in this was phenomenal! One of the best soundtracks I've heard in a One Piece film. A few of the songs in particular stood out to me, some of the darker scenes were made all the more chilling with the music that accompanied it. 

Same goes for the more exciting or high energy scenes, the upbeat music was very well timed with the comedy. I would watch this film again just for the sake of this soundtrack. 

Character: 7 
Our main cast is all present for this movie. Currently in the manga / anime the Straw Hats have split up and it's been a long while since they were all together. So it was refreshing to see everyone. 
Not every character gets a shining moment though. Some of the Straw Hats just stood there for the majority of the film. Even characters like Sanji only got a few good kicks in for his final fight and that might be disappointing to many fans. 

I'll avoid spoilers, however as a side note, there are characters who I wish had gotten more screen time and I also wish some of the new characters that were introduced had more time to be developed as well. Since it is a movie it's limited in what it can deliver because of time, but I think they could have afforded to give these new characters a few extra minutes. 

Tesoro was a great villain with an intriguing past. I wasn't expecting to learn much about his history but we do get a crash course on his childhood / young adult life and the story did well to make him more than a one-dimensional villain. Perhaps not to the point that you sympathize with him much since there were few redeeming qualities about him, but it is nice when the writers put effort into making a character more than just a raging psychopath with no motivation. I wish we could have seen more of his history, but either way I was satisfied with what I received. 

Enjoyment: 8
There were several laugh-out-loud funny moments in this film. While not all around comedy gold, there were a few distinct parts where I just folded laughing. 

As previously mentioned, the art is great and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how nicely the fights were animated. If anything, the fights in the movie alone are worth the price of admission. There was enough action and adventure throughout the run-time and I walked out feeling satisfied. 

When comparing it to other One Piece films, I'd say I enjoyed it more than Film Z, but overall I'd say it is not as entertaining as Strong World. 

Overall: 8
If you like One Piece, go see this. If you don't like One Piece, I doubt this will be the movie to change your mind. It still has all the typical and at times “cliche” One Piece moments, and follows the same structure we've seen with many villains and storylines in the original series, but even so it's a fun ride. 

While this is not the best One Piece film in my opinion, it still ranks high on the list and is certainly worth watching.",False,anime_review,31490,2016-08-10T19:28:00+00:00
"This one was remarkably well-plotted for a shonen anime tie-in movie. Lots of moving pieces. Every new character was there for a reason beyond simply being the bad guy of the week, and the preexisting cast outside of the Straw Hats were well-integrated. And who doesn't like a heist movie? That said, its message is at once something I deeply agree with and something I despair over it needing to be said at all. In our global economic system, money equals power and ownership of other people. Employment is indistinguishable from slavery, only instead of whips they psychologically torment us with the threat of homelessness. Thereare countless other pieces of media that say exactly the same thing (which is fine) and the social programming that says that this situation is OK is so thick that there are probably people out there who enjoy this and came away believing they would make a ""good rich person"" if they were given the chance. Which would make them indistinguishable from the villain, who achieved his dream of wealth and then proceeded to be this sort of person. Which, yes, is part of the message, but it just sickens me that that could be lost on anyone to any extent.

Why does this need to be said? Money is the root of all evil (well, the authority that comes with it). Money is a fake thing that people decided should exist several thousand years ago. It has widely, empirically proven itself to be a grand disaster of humanitarian proportions. And yet we still need to spend money to buy fucking food. To buy fucking housing from people whose ""job"" is owning places others are forced at (the police's) gunpoint to pay rent to remain in. There is no satisfactory explanation for this situation.",False,anime_review,31490,2022-08-04T00:44:00+00:00
"Leave it to the movie production's team to consistently create a dollar-store One Piece's story While the final confrontation and the backstory of Tesoro managed to reach that high canon standard, sadly, almost anything else in here is guaranteed you'll never caught Oda slacking and putting any into his main storyline. The Western influence of the mafias and heist movies is so apparent and so cheaply recreated, they didn't even try to masks all the twist and cliches they've borrowed. The spirit of the main crew is lost in this mixture, they're even betraying the character in one scene where there are kids being abused and Luffyjust standing there watching! 

This feels like someone trying to do One Piece instead of really doing it. It's a jumble of everything that you has ever liked about the series, but so try-hard and half-assed, resulting in zero personality.",False,anime_review,31490,2024-06-22T09:03:00+00:00
"One piece Film gold i by far my favorite one piece movie but you will notice i still gave it a 8/10 due to the predictable ending and side characters which could've played a much better role in the story if introduced well. as well as the way the trailer introduced a few characters which got people exited for only to be disappointed by how small a role they were given. Story- 7/10 Good The story in one piece film gold is well average and meets the other one piece movies standards story well if you loved the story of the past one piece moviesthen you will have no problem with this one. Rather than following a completely original narrative like previous films Z and Strong World, One Piece Film: Gold uses the typical story-arc structure seen in such arcs as Thriller Bark and Punk Hazard.

Art- 9/10 Great
as a person who watches one piece weekly it was amazing to see the straw hat pirates gloriously animated after being stuck with less then acceptable animation weekly

sound- 9/10 Great
The soundtrack for one piece film gold is above average not saying that the normal one piece soundtrack is bad i love it just as much as the one in film gold. compared to the other one piece movies soundtrack this one is so much better.

Characters- 7/10 good
Although i like the gild tesoro he was pure entertainment but next to Shiki and Z who are legendary characters in the one piece universe he cant compare to the two And some characters were huge disappointments as i mentioned in the beginning i wont say who to avoid spoilers but i thing people who watch the movie can agree with me. and side characters who could've been introduced in a better way as for the outfits tesoro and Robins were the ones to me stood out the most.

Enjoyment- 8/10 very good
One piece Film gold Was really Fun the movie starts in and amazing way and ends in predictable but enjoyable fight.

Overall- 8/10 Very good

"As a One Piece fan, you may look at this movie from different prospectives: At one side, a manga reader will complain about the story, or about its consistency. An anime fan may look at it and think ""Wow, so this is where the budget was going to"". While a casual fan will probably simply enjoy it and not think too much about it. On my point of view, I cannot consider this movie a 10/10 for various reasons, but first, let's talk about what it was good: SOUND/MUSIC: I honestly cannot find anything to complain here. The soundtrack was really good, it goes perfectly and smoothlywith each transition. We have old style Toei sound effects that never get old and make some sequences and attacks look badass as usual. Voice acting on point. Nothing negative here. 

ART/ANIMATION:
I noticed I fairly big amount of CGI mixed with the drawn characters and objects. Sometimes it's too overwhelming, especially when there are several shots of background and scenery that barely have any artwork in it, definitely not amazing. However, the animation itself was nearly flawless, a good thing from Toei, out of every studio... The whole thing was colored and animated very well, there are good switches of light and tonality in each scene, and I was glad to see that I could enjoy some One Piece without any derpy face or bad drawn limb to worry about. 

CHARACTERS:
Now, there are a few things to consider here. Despite I can't say that the characters introduced in this movie are as good as some very memorable canon characters, I can see the issue of writing a character and expose it in a 2 hours movie, which definitely it's not enough, but I found a couple of them pretty likable. The villain of the movie, who by the way is introduced before the main characters, is kinda overpowered in his own way, but has a charm of his own, even though, as I mentioned before, he doesn't compare to canon villains, he still was a lot better than Hody Jones. I loved seeing certain characters of the canonical story getting involved. Despite the short screentime, it felt more connected to the rest.  As for the main cast, I kinda saw Luffy out of character a few times, especially at the start, but then everything went back to normal once the plot kicked in. Speaking of which... 

STORY/PLOT:
The plot isn't particularly different from other One Piece arcs. Which consists in getting into a new island, getting involved in a few shenenigans and kick the bad guy's ass. I appreciated a lot the how they came up with the whole concept of the island, and how it works. There were a few creative powers introduced, and I liked their use. The actual story kicks in around the 40th minute mark, in which the whole movie gets more interesting. Before that mark it's all about establishing how things are, and the crew fooling around. The concept that the movie talks about, slavery, greed, power, injustice etc... are nothing new to the series. Although more subtle than usual, they were there. Just for a change, One Piece mixed itself with Mission Impossible and Ocean 11, and I can't lie that it was pretty funny. Even though it's not its strong point, the plot is quite bareble, quite out of nowhere, takes a few twists, and it gets triggered in a way I honestly did not like. The ending, I liked it. It wasn't anything amazing, but at least put a smile on my face. Not really much I can say, since it's not tied with outside events and it's palpable in the execution of the movie itself. 

Overall, a very good movie, for the premise and purpose that it had, I can say that I wasn't disappointed, but neither extremely surprised. I think 8/10 is pretty fair, counting my enjoyment as well. If not, at least a 7 for recognising both good things and bad sides of it. 
It was pretty fun, I would probably reccomand it to a fan.",False,anime_review,31490,2017-01-24T09:54:00+00:00
"This movie will always be a little special for me. Because It's the first Anime movie I went to see in theaters. Funimation sent me a notice in my email that it would be entering a limited Dub release into U.S theaters and a quick Google Search showed that it was showing in my local theater. And It was good too. Take everything we love about one piece. The Characters, the piracy, the villains, and then add a master thief element. Mix it with the Oceans Movies or the Leverage Tv show and that's the movie you got. yeah I know Awesome right! I mean weliterally had the straw hat's in a casino pulling a con. They had the whole double reveal and everything It really felt like I was watching a heist movie. 

But that wasn't all. No One Piece movie works without a good set of villains. You can make or break a one piece move with weak villains. And Gold did it good. They give you a Lady Luck, and even a masochist dude.

"A One Piece movie with a final battle that, for once, isn't that anticlimactic (I'm looking at you, Strong World and Z). Story (7) One Piece: Gold takes place directly after the Dressrosa arc. Gran Tesoro as an ""island"" of gold and entertainment is a pretty cool concept, and the beginning is a fun time as the Straw Hats try their hand at a couple of casino games. The Redline-esque Turtle Car Race ft. Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper is a definite highlight of this section, and the suspense is heightened by the fact that, at this point, you're probably expecting Something To Go Wrong. After all,god forbid this crew to successfully make it out of something loaded with money. 

The Straw Hats have a chill time bumming around and winning lots and lots of Berries, but they eventually realize that something is amiss. As in they get conned and one of their members is abducted. In general there's nothing particularly original going on here; the writers followed the classic Oda formula of creating a set of oppressed characters deserving of liberation, and it's up to Luffy and his nakama to do the job. This means taking down a classic OP antagonist--Tesoro himself, who has a heartfelt backstory involving...gold--followed by a series of 1v1 fights near the climax of the movie, with the help of some endearing side characters. As usual, right before the final fight, Luffy yells a couple of lines about how he will protect his nakama while the villain laughs in his face. Despite all of this, the strongest part about Gold's story *is* its ability to surprise you. The main plot comprises a 10/10 literal heist, followed by a twist towards the end; plus one of the Straw Hats is out of commission for most of the movie and it actually isn't Nami.

As far as plot goes: Gold &gt; Strong World &gt;&gt; Z

Character (6)

Possibly the weakest point of the movie, but I actually loved how there was so much focus on Nami. And this time, rather than serving a role as the damsel like in Strong World, she somewhat carries the authority of first-mate, which is fitting when you consider the setting. This is partially because the actual first-mate (arguably) is MIA for most of the movie due to Plot. There's also a bit of Luffy and Franky team up, which made things pretty interesting. The villains are ultimately forgettable, save for the female commander and her DF, but she gets defeated much, much too easily. Tesoro himself has a decent backstory and an OP devil fruit ability, but the latter becomes somewhat useless once we get to the big fight.

The biggest blow, however, is the fact that none of the other characters get any kind of spotlight. Zoro and Sanji have, like, three lines each, which is a shame (though Zoro does have a cool fight at the end, as usual), and Usopp/Chopper/Robin/Brook are practically nonexistent, solely existing for comedic relief at best. We don't really get any interesting or exciting interactions between these characters either, not even just fun one-liner exchanges, but I think that's mainly because it's not the movie's focus. Gold is definitely more a plot/action-heavy movie, so if you're in it for the power of friendship, then you're better off rewatching Baron Omatsuri.

Art (8)

Gran Tesoro comes alive under a beautiful color scheme that only occasionally is hard to look at. The main fights are also animated really well, given the sakuga love that a series like OP deserves. Once again the Straw Hats dress up in badass outfits before taking down the Big Bad, but unlike Strong World and Z, this time there's actually a point to being all matchy-matchy, which was cool. There's not much to pick on here, besides that one of the side characters kind of looks like mini-Usopp.

Sound (8)

Yuki Hayashi composed the OST and it shows. Meaning that it's really good. If you liked the final fight in the Boku no Hero Academia movie partly because the score was hype, you'll probably like this one too. 

Overall (7)

My second favorite OP film, right behind Baron Omatsuri. Since much of this movie's focus revolves around gold, thematically it aligns with the Dressrosa arc and what we know of Luffy/Sabo's backstory. Bonus points for that. All in all though, It's Entertainment.",False,anime_review,31490,2018-12-30T17:22:00+00:00
"My god was that a ride to remember, no really, if anything, these movies were written by Oda are the most I've ever seen in the history of anime movies, like for instance, Naruto movies were not that good except for some, but in One Piece, those are shinning like Tesoro's gold on a dark night. That was the type of movies you would expect to rewatch at least once a year, while it was slightly different from what a pirate does, it turned out to be a fantastic journey, the humor, twists, backstories, and action are all present, and let me tell you, would youget a huge treat for unique character, someone them will let you wish they were canon, but we've got to only have faith in Oda, and he will surely deliver.

- Story (9/10):
The story of the movie has been teased long before the actual events of the movies started, and it made for heck of an amazing build up, and that had a great reward on itself, like for instance, we heard about Gran Tesoro the first time back on that filler after Dressrosa, the “Sliver Mine” arc, it was a decent one, they kept referencing Tesoro and hyping him up as “The monster of the new world”, and yes, he did live up to that reputation, and then, there was the prequel to the movie, yet another fantastic special, would really recommand it, it was called “Heart of Gold”, it served itself as an amazing teaser too, and then again, there was that “episode 0” special about them going to Gran Tesoro, all of those animations were such a great hype up, leading to the finale, which is this movie.
The movie starts off as the straw hats arrive at Gran Tesoro, the so-called biggest entertainment city in the world, owned by someone that's not only is recognized as the biggest entertainer but also one of the top richest people that have 20% of all the world's berries, the so-called king of casinos and gambling, and to our surprise, he has quite the depressing backstory surrounding him as well.
This movie, or at least for me, is quite special, and more distinguishable than others, because, in addition to the adventure, it has an extra “new” element, you get to see some big budget planning for probably one of the biggest thefts in the history of One Piece, you see the straw hats working together as burglar, going undercover, sneaking around and acting according to plane, it really has that big “Ocean's Eleven” trilogy vibes to it, but ofcourse, there would be a lot of goofying off by the members of the crew at times, but as you should know, when it comes to action, they would break quite the havoc. The world of One Piece seems a lot more massive now that I look at it, how Gran Tesoro is a country on a ship, recognized by the world government, there must be a lot of crazy stuff out there. And the fights were so spot on, as soon as the movie starts, you get to see the straw hats showing off them moves to the public, living up to their reputation, and the matter remains throughout the movie, something else I found intreging is the existence of cars, very odd to see in One Piece, the last time I remember seeing functioning vehicles other than ships, where Ace's special boat (or whatever it's called), and Smoker's bike that run on smoke, that added a lot to the movie, to be honest, the lore was crazy.

- Art (10/10):
No need to make this over the top, but believe me, those were some crisp looking eye candy right there, and it is expected from such a heavy budget movie of One Piece's, you better get yourself to immersive that animation, everything looks very fluid, the facial animations, the movements, even the backgrounds feel so much alive, you can get that the world is moving, and people are interacting out of view.
What are very amazing, were the outfits, oh my, it's been a while since I saw that straw hats in mafia suits back on Film: Strong World, and get this, this movie was no difference, seeing the straw hats in them luxury tuxedos, and the girls in those fashionable dresses, that was amazing, and don't get me started, how they captured Robin and Nami's feminine side's, they were both beautiful.

- Sound (10/10):
I haven't been much of a picky guy when it came to the sound effects and music tracks in movies, but ever since the last movie, Film: Z, a new guideline was set off to me, I can't tolerate pitchily and cheat sound-craft special in heavy budget projects like this one, I expected something big, and boy did I get more than I saw coming, yes, everything from the music, or the most silent wisp of wind, you can see it so clear, the work on the soundtrack was fantastic, for each moment their track, the most sutable you can think about, and let's not overlook the voice acting here, boy, the cast knows what they're doing, I'm talking big performance here, even for those side characters, Baccarat did a phenominal job, replicating that accent while speaking some english words, it really captured the type of character she was playing, let's not forget about Gild himself, that villain laugh of his, second only to Doffy's.

- Character (10/10):
I don't usually give this high score to a movie project when it comes to characters and development giving the time span of the movie and events plus, most of the time, your characters are your usual straw hat members, but this movie falls into a special case, filled with new faces as well as very familiar ones, I spotted a lot of them in fact that I am pretty sure I could have missed a few.
Let's talk about Carina for a second, a match for Nami, she was shown for a very brief shot on the prequel special for this movie, “Heart of Gold”. Foreshadowing her coming, and there she is, sharing a past with our cat burglar, they both shine in the profession (can I even call it that?), she was clearly in the spotlights, manages to steal your attention for once, the same can be told about Tesoro, as I mentioned before, the monster of the new world, totally lives up to his potential, and really seemed like a threat to the crew members, his ideology blent so well with his past, and his resulting present.
Among many amazing characters, there was one specific annoying individual that appeared on the first even teaser of the movie on that “Silver Mine” arc, that cat looking man, or is it a man looking cat? Whatever he is, he was a nuisance.
As I said earlier, in addition to those new characters, we got to see old ones, like Spandam, and Lucci, there was also Absalom and that guy from cypher pole whole Sanji fought on the train heading to Eniese Lobby whom he had to structure his face for a chance, it really makes you wonder about the odds. There was also Sabo and Koala, let's not forget Akainu too.

- Enjoyment (10/10):
Like the action-adventure-comedy-thrill loved I am, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, the 2 hours animation felt like a journey, that ended very fast, time sure passes when you have fun the most huh!!
I would like to see upcoming movies of the same quality, that would be quite the treat, to be honest, it's been a while since I watched a movie and ended up liking it, this one is out there among the best of the best.

- Overall(9.8/10):
Thye way this movie is, makes me want to recommend it even to the non-One-Piece-fans, it would even pull people to getting into One Piece, I pinned this to my to-watch-list 6 months ago, and I'm wondering why I have ignored it this whole time, totally a worth watching movie.",False,anime_review,31490,2018-02-23T09:18:00+00:00
"Watching One Piece Film Gold was a very passive experience. It wasn’t amazing, but it wasn’t bad. Nothing stood out, and nothing really annoyed me; the characters were fine, the villains weak, and overall it did feel separated from the general narrative. It was a nice change in the pace of One Piece movies, with a couple of predictable twists. While I wouldn’t call it a cash grab, it was pretty close, as it, for the most part, was very uninspired. The movie’s plot was what you would expect from a movie, a plot that “does the job,” and that’s it. Sailing on the ocean,the Straw Hats come across a floating ship (I’d think) larger than Thriller Bark, the theme of this ship gambling. With thousands of Casino’s, betting places, and gambling halls, it is said to be the largest gambling place globally, where many earn their fortunes for life there. Nami, of course, encourages them to go, and they enter the literal city of gold. Greeted by a shower of gold, they excitedly enter the city. They play around, winning some games, and losing others, but after being cheated out of over 500 million Beli, Zoro is taken captive, with the only way of freeing him to win and pay within 24 hours. This leads to a heist, in which the Straw Hats team up with an unlikely friend to steal from the grand vault that contains 20% of the world’s currency to free Zoro. 

Now, as a setting, the island is a little weird. Most of One Piece is in a less technologically advanced era than us, their snails being the most advanced thing (aside from Vegapunks creations) we have seen. However, the city oozes with casinos that have elevators, slot machines, and more gold than seems possible. It may seem cool in a worldbuilding perspective that it implies that other ships like thriller bark act as entire islands, but ultimately it depends on how it is pulled off. While Thriller bark somehow fits, Film Gold just doesn’t. It feels just like an island that the Straw Hats went, unconnected to the One-Piece world, rather than another small piece in the world of One Piece. While Casino’s might exist in the One Piece world, it didn’t seem to fit. That being said, there were plenty of other things that worked amazingly and were nice throwbacks. We see our favorite character, Cipher Pol agent. Spandam collects the heavenly tribute from the island that allows it to act as part of the world government, a small piece of the previously mentioned information. We see things such as the world nobles, all the different transponder snails, and wacky fruit powers that have nothing todo with strength, each small pieces that add up. While they aren’t the show’s focus, it’s these weird and little things that still populate the world from setting to setting, letting us know it is One Piece and the settings we love. While there were no outstanding or crazy worldbuilding displays, it was still there in small, enjoyable bits that you might find independently. 

Despite the first two paragraphs, the concept of the movie was unique. It didn’t go for the typical, save people from oppression, or help the weak, or even the personal connection that most movies do. It set up a friendly and familiar place that seemed cool but then was flipped on their heads, and they specifically could not use their powers, forcing them to use their brains rather than their raw strength. It forces the characters to use their powers in more unconventional ways. Rather than just busting right through, the movie takes advantage of its average budget for more of a cool and calculated movie. There were small hints like most movies and buildup for the final battle trying to build themes of oppression. And while the buildup was in generic ways that have been seen many times, it still managed to work and deliver the theme even if it was a generic one.

While It wasn’t amazing or kept me interested the whole time, it was interesting enough to warrant a watch, the ending, and the new character Carina, small things that helped the movie feel bittersweet, despite being mediocre. The character Carina helped the movie connect to the One Piece world and change up the dynamic a bit. Watching only the Straw Hats Converse is always fun, and you still want more, each pure interaction gold. However, no matter how good the movie’s writers are, it doesn’t always capture the charm. It just leads to conversations we have heard a lot in the 1000chapter story, but adding a personal connection always makes it change up to seem more interesting. Carina seems to be one of Nami’s friends back in the time when she was stealing and looting pirates for Arlong, reminding us of her past, as well as making it feel more real. It sets up an enjoyable dynamic, as they were both temporarily allied thieves, meaning that they could backstab anyone at any given time, making them cautious but also really close, a bond that we rarely see. They tease and play around but can switch to serious at the flip of a coin. While she isn’t a fantastic character, she is always interesting and gives the movie that extra spice it needed. 

The Straw Hats were fine in the movie, their interactions fun but not as fun as the main story. They each get small moments to shine, focused more on their powers and abilities than personalities (aside from Nami)but still had their personalities intact. They seem to be at the development between Dressrosa, and Zou, allowing for some power-ups and collecting all the characters in one voyage. The villains were also nicely handled, as they weren’t just generic villains, but smart ones that weren’t evil for the sake ofbeing evil. Their actions made sense, and each was quite decent. The first villain was a masochistic armament Haki user, who was the size of Ivankov. The second villain was a wielder of Raki Raki no mi, and who had an elegant personality. The third villain was a vampirish guy who had the nuki nuki no mi and just gave off a creepy vibe. While they weren’t fantastic characters by themselves, they were devout followers of Guild Tesoro, who had a compelling enough ideology that made them become followers who seemed both reasonable and loyal. Guild Tesoro had a backstory that served the purpose of making you understand his actions while not justifying them. It made an irredeemable villain that you could understand but never stand by, one we don’t see very often anymore. Combined with expert use of his devil fruit, cunning schemes, and being strong as well as smart, he made for quite a good antagonist for the movie. They needed the money and respected money, and the Straw Hats are bad people in the world government’s eyes. If there were one thing that I would complain about, however, it would be the fact that he became a giant monster at the end, like almost every other One Piece movie antagonist, but aside from that, he did well in his movie. 

The art and animation were adequately done, allowing for some small and interesting fights. While they weren’t like the regular movie Sakuya, it still did the job of giving some interesting combinations. The One-Piece characters all looked like One Piece characters, and the animation was nice and good. The sound design, for the most part, was forgettable but didn’t hinder the movies watching experience. It did all it needed to do and enhanced certain scenes it needed to.

Throughout the movie, I never thought, “This is Amazing.” After watching the slightly disappointing Film Z, it definitely was a step up and interesting but never came close to blowing me away. On a 100 point scale, I would rate it as a 6.94, but not a 7 as it just didn’t land right. Again, the setting, story, villains, and plot were fine and fun, but not something to brag or tick off a list, just something that ticked over. I do suggest you watch it if you have time on your hands, as it is quite decent. I might be underrating is as I was disappointed slightly, and it could very well be a solid 7. But at the end of the day, more One Piece is always good.

"""One Piece: Gold"" definitely has its flaws, but overall I found it to be an enjoyable One Piece film. The animation and art style are both excellent. The Strawhats going to a casino serves as the perfect excuse to dress them up in new, flashy outfits. The action scenes are nicely animated as well. The plot feels a bit forced at times. There's no real explanation as to why the crew ended up in Gran Tesoro - apparently, Luffy just decided they should go to the casino? And the plot wasn't exactly original either. Nonetheless, it ends up being entertaining. Plus, there are a bunch ofcharacters that have cameos throughout the film. There are moments where the Strawhats feel a bit out of character, though.

The newly introduced characters - Tesoro, Baccarat, Carina etc. - are well designed and consistent. They have distinct personalities and, in general, they are good characters. Personally, I would have liked to know more about the other side characters, not just about Tesoro and Carina. The antagonist's backstory was fine, although it felt a bit cliché and rushed. I do understand, however, that there wasn't enough screen time to fully explain and explore his past. Same as how there wasn't enough time to develop each character.

In conclusion, One Piece: Gold is a decent work, but not a must-watch for fans of the series. It lacks a bit of coherence sometimes, and it's far from perfect; still, it's an amusing film with good quality animation.",False,anime_review,31490,2025-10-25T11:45:00+00:00
"I know i might be writing this review very late but since i watched this movie very late i didnt get a chance.This movie is fantastic for every One Piece fan. If you are a normie then you wouldnt understand anything. I would like to keep my review short and simple to the point. At First look, This movie's animation looks outstanding. The studio worked very hard on animating it and they made an excellent job. The characters looked great and their Drip was on fire. The plot setting up on an island casino was surreal, it felt like going on an exciting adventure with thestrawhats. Although it was filler, it felt like part of the main story.

All the strawhats looked great, and Tesoro was a great villain, my only complaint is that we didnt get to see much of Tesoro's backstory which might be interesting but we got Carina's story which disappointed me. Soundtrack was great. 
If you are a One Piece fan then you will love it. Better than the previous installments tho.

BY far i would rate the following:
STORY : 9/10
ANIMATION: 10/10
CHARACTERS:8/10
SOUND:8/10
VERDICT: 9/10
Very enjoyable and if u want to rewatch the series or if u left off and u want to pick up ur pace in One Piece, I would definetely recommend watching Film Gold along with episode 0. Definetely worth the watch. Oh it contains a bit of fanservice for Nami swaaaaaaan and Robin Chwaaaan fans,lmao(on Ep 0)

And for G4 fans, definetely great pick, and this movie would be best to watch after Episode 747 in the anime precisely after the dressrosa arc.",False,anime_review,31490,2020-09-13T00:35:00+00:00
"This is my favourite One piece movie by a long shot. Great story, music, animation, and fights. The whole gold aesthetic fits perfectly for one piece and I wish the whole show was this slick. The villain was a bit generic but that's fine because the rest is just amazing. One piece animation has never been better. It was so pleasurable to watch. The whole crew gets the spotlight and my favourite Zoro has a really cool scene, Nami has something to do! Overall a must watch for One piece fans and anime in general. I wish this story was cannon to the series and could ofhave some cool consequences to the main story but no, none of the movies are like that.

"The Casino/Gran Torino concept for the Straw Hats to enter a new adventure with great pacing...this movie was made properly and it has great presentation. It fixes the pacing of the previous arc of Dressrosa. It was highly enjoyable for me with the use of betting and gold as a key theme in the movie. I believe that this movie is well made for the fans of One Piece, especially since it was released at the time of an inconsistent arc of Dressrosa. There was a plan for the team to adapt within the movie within the set circumstances and there is a plot twist which quickly acceleratesthe end of the movie...which was worthwhile.",False,anime_review,31490,2025-08-21T13:03:00+00:00
"I liked this film every time it did something we've never seen before. Unfortunately those moments were few and far between the stuff I've seen wayyyyyyyyyy too much of. I kinda wish they could've run with the casino/heist aspect and just run with it. The snail-powered car race, Luffy ascending the tower and the entire dance-off that kick-started the movie were all joys to behold. Sadly it didn't take long to descend into all-too-familiar territory. I feel this film would be considered great if it wasn't coming hot off the heals of the brilliant STRONG WORLD and FILM Z.

"This was my first One Piece film and what a banger it was! I was actually surprised by how low the score seems, but to me it's a 10/10 one. Firstly, I live place the action is happening at. Gran Teroso is on par with Whole Cake Island as my favorite islands/places. They felt so unique and beautiful, but if course I'll have to focus on only one of them today. The colors, the buildings, the dresses and the people, it all works together so good creating what I'd call a paradise for one's eyes. Secondly, the characters. The straw hats were one level above whatI had previously seen in Stampede and Z which was great. They had bigger roles and more screen time than before and so this is a + from me.

Thirdly, the Antagonist. Gild Tesoro has to be one of favorite OP villains. No shame in saying that, but he is on par with Doffy for me, love them equally. To be honest they actually share not one or two characteristics whether behavior, looks or other, but still, he felt unique and one I really enjoyed. To be frank, he was the star of this movie for me heheh.

The story itself was good, didn't feel unfinished or something like that, unlike other from the franchise and the conclusion was good. Throughout the film I never lost attention and its understandable taking what I've said before into account.

In conclusion I think it's the best entry in the OP film universe and would recommend it to anyone. Really elevated my experience as I'm a manga reader for One Piece and now I got to hear the VA's and witness good and clear animation. That's it from me, have a great day!",False,anime_review,31490,2022-03-28T14:15:00+00:00
"Well, be aware that my assessment will focus on the film itself, not the universe from which it came. History: Not bad though, some points did not allow it to be better, to make it easier to understand: Treasure flashback could have been inserted from the beginning, and being played in parts to the end, this would dexter the character much better. As the subject is history, let's continue, the story of Carina, not bad, it even links with the Heart Of Gold, and did not make a mistake to put it even being filler, as something real in the work. What would leave the story better:show the origin of the Treasure, as well as a little more information about the Grand Treasury and its relations with the world.
Art and sound: Absurdly perfect, from the designs, to the animation and the excellent soundtracks, all perfect. I can not find anything to score negatively. Grade 10
Characters: Well, the big problem I saw with the Treasure was to try to turn it into a substitute for Doflamingo, obviously a fanservice, since Mingo was one of One Piece's most acclaimed villains.
Carina: Not a bad character, she has a VERY charismatic and lovely personality.
The other secondary ones do not have so much importance in the film, except the subordinates of the Treasure, that are not explored, and only served for the final fight.
Maybe, if you put something else in the Treasure, a differential would have been a lot nicer, and as I mentioned up there, Tesoro had all his flashback summarized in a minute, something very disappointing, because even in that little time, you realize the potential that he would have as a character.
Another problem found in this film: the slow narrative, which does not hold the ante for the most part, from the beginning, until near the end. This is really a bad thing, because it hurts the experience with the movie, causing many people not to appreciate the positives and end up ""sleeping"" in the movie.
Well, before closing, I would like to talk about the Mugiwaras: Well done, more than Film Z, many were important in the script, the big fan service, Gear Fourth, did not disappoint much (note that it's not a bad thing to be a fan service), the fights were well worked out, and made up for all the boredom the movie can cause.
A good film, however, should be watched without overdoing the expectations.",False,anime_review,31490,2019-03-01T17:58:00+00:00
"Art (7): One of One Piece animation's key points is the vibrant colors and in this case, GOLD. In this movie, lighting and contrast is too bright which can be regarded as eye candy. As for the character design, the women's designs are exaggerated to some degree especially their breasts. One of the notable parts of this movie is the action scenes which was animated quite well. Other than that. compared to the previous movies that Oda supervised and helped create, this lacks a bit in the animation side. Sound (10): What I enjoyed the most in this movie is the music. From upbeat soundto mellow ones, they create the atmosphere perfect for the scenes. From the introduction to the end, the music is one of the parts that is well done in the movie.

Character (6): To avoid spoilers, I will try to keep this short and just give subtle hints. Three of the strawhats have a bigger role than the others and is elaborated a bit but other than that, nothing changed. The characters were consistent (assuming since this is a movie, character developments are not that much. As for the new characters, they are very straight-forward and a bit bland. 

Story (6): The movie is the same with the other One Piece Films which always introduce the villain first before our main characters. A common thread in the OP movies as well is the number of antagonists to which the strawhats would individually defeat with the Monster Trio getting most of the spotlight. The movie doesn't really depict much of the pirate-ish vibe of the strawhat since the setting is a bit more modern and doesn't center much around their piracy. There are bits and pieces for the side characters but doesn't get much hype at all.",False,anime_review,31490,2017-04-03T19:41:00+00:00
"First off, definitely don't bother watching this unless you're a One Piece fan. Secondly, definitely don't watch this if you're a One PIece fan. Most of the characters either act different than in the show, are far weaker than in the show, or more likely some combination of both. Even now I think about how the villain's power to control gold was utterly pointless. It wasn't used in any meaningful way, and the tiny bit of morality that is attempted feels completely hollow. BTW Zoro couldn't cut through gold..like wut...and Nami didn't attempt to use gold as a conductor to be used foranything.  Two basic interactions that Gold could've had with two abilities of the main characters.  On top of that, this is post time skip in One Piece so you would expect plenty of Haki, but the movie actually has basically no haki used at all.
The music was fairly upbeat and makes you think stuff is happening, but not memorable in any way.
As for animation, it's good, but also not ambitious at all.
Finally as for the specifics of the story. It's bland nonsense. There's an island with lots of gold, but the guy in charge controls gold, and therefore uses it to enslave the whole population, except for a small group of people who love him, who also mysteriously disappear from the fiilm once the villain loses his powers temporarily. 
The ""best"" part of the movie is a rushed, undetailed backstory given to the villain that is basically not addressed at all, but looked better than this whole movie due to its connections to the slavery done by the Celestial Dragons.     
My best guess is that it was thrown in the movie just to show that the villain became who he hated...which would be fine/great if it was a major part of the plot. Instead, the villain should hate the celestial dragons but at the end of the day he's helping them quite a bit.
Oh and Zoro getting captured was just nonsense based on what we know he can do.
That's the whole movie. Have a great day.",False,anime_review,31490,2021-08-24T18:01:00+00:00
"Includes spoiler, but idk why you would be watching this movie without watching the original first Toei does a bang up job on ruining the source material, somehow in 2018 they managed to make the animation worse than it did 10+ years ago, the major fights within the arc ,including chopper, zoro, and luffy getting literally 1 still image of them defeating there opponents, or the animation was awful. the final attack that finished the arc 10+ years ago(Luffy punching Eneru into the bell) had so much weight and impact, but this movie made it look very choppy and had way less frames of animation.",False,anime_review,37902,2018-08-26T10:09:00+00:00
"Making a 1 hour 40 minutes long movie out of 44 episodes long anime arc might look good on paper, but... oh wait, it looks terrible on paper and comes off exactly as soulless and empty as one could fear. Exactly 6 years ago today, the ""Episode of"" movie series for One Piece started with Nami's past story. Some of these episodes (movies) were totally worth of watching and managed to be partly better than the original tv series. Sorajima (or Skypiea like it's know in English) mainly further shows that Toie is on a slope. Digimon movies and Dragon Ball Super were clearly not enoughto stain their nonexistent reputation, so naturally, they are now offering the same with One Piece. Gj. 

I imagine this thing was structured by making a list of scenes that should be here, and then they were edited together. Whatever should have been there in-between those scenes to create tension, work as a build-up and make the movie have a solid pacing -- is not there. They did attempt to capture some of that with cheap narration of what occurred, but ""eh"" is pretty much the word I found myself saying when witnessing that. This thing really don't even seem like a continuous movie but rather an animated memo. 

At least some improvement exists. Nami's boobs are way bigger than in the original and Nico Robin's Rack is so enormous I wouldn't even dare to write it without a capital letter. Priorities were clearly in all the right places when this was planned. 

One Piece has been criticized for its ridiculously slow tempo/pace, but rushing things in this manner somehow made the thing way worse and so boring that it was mainly a waste of time and only managed to make the arc seem exponentially worse than it originally was.",False,anime_review,37902,2018-08-26T12:16:00+00:00
"Skypiea Arc This arc is one of my favorite arc in One Piece-- so I had high expectation on this recap movie. It was fine but ALL of the fun moments were not included (yeah probably to make the movie shorter, should have include some parts atleast) and most of the parts were shortcut. This one so far is my least fave movie in One Piece. I guess I expected too much in this recap. All in all, I had to say that this arc is one of the best! but I just don't get it why some people just didn't like this Arc. It was oneof the legendary arcs out there. Noland and Kalgara's story was heartbreaking. It was the best. Luffy bell the rang, proving to Cricket that the Sky has been in the sky all along. I FELT GOOSEBUMPS and I will never get tired of that moment. After 400 years ago, Noland was known as a liar in most people but now, strawhats proved to one of his Noland's descendant, Cricket, that half of the Jaya island was actually in the Sky.

"Alright, I'm going to give a general overview and highlight all the stuff this special did good/bad: - First, animation is pretty solid, but you can see they really did not want to waste their fighting animators (Good sign for Luffy VS Katakuri) because there's barely any fighting in it. The only fights they even adapted somewhat fully were: - Luffy's Group VS Satori - Ganfall/Wiper VS Shura - Luffy VS Enel The rest were just either images in a montage or the very end of the fights, like: - Luffy VS Wiper - Enel VS Kamakiri - Chopper VS Gedatsu - Zoro VS Ohm (Though this got a bit of the beginning forcontext)
So If you wanted to watch this 1 Hour 45 minute special for the fights I recommend just waiting for Youtube clips.
- Only the key elements of Jaya (Mainly the exposition) are added to I think the first 20 minutes or so, so we really only get to meet Cricket, the Saruyama Brothers barely even speak. So no, Mock ---Town, No BB (In Jaya at least), no Bounties, no South Bird, just ship falls, meet Cricket, learn about Sky Island/Knock Up Stream, and ride the current into the Sky.
- The crew is barely in the White Sea for long, and they changed it to Enel sensing them with Mantra instead of the the gate with Amazon. Because of this, we meet Ganfall relaxing on a Beach while the Waver they found in the shipwreck is just one Conis rides.
- The almighty Pagaya (Conis' Father) does not appear at all, so he doesn't die, so, I guess that's a plus?
- The Monster Trio still fight the sky fish, just the fish were chasing Conis not the Merry.
- Instead of the Trials, Enel sends Satori to fight the ""invaders"" on the beach, where Chopper and Suu are kidnapped by a lobster with the merry and become the sacrifice.
- Because of this, Zoro and Robin with Conis have to take a random Dial Boat (Explained by having Luffy send Zoro to protect them) while Nami takes the Waver Conis left. This is weird because Usopp just stays with Luffy and Sanji and does nothing, without the reasoning of being stuck in the forest like the original.
- Also, Ganfall never gives out a whistle, so instead of the iconic whistle scene with Chopper, Ganfall just hears our reindeer friend yell very loudly in pain.
- Instead of having the Noland Flashback in one go like the original, they split up about three times. -Also, they did NOT reanimate the Noland Flashback, they just cleaned up the original and made it fit to the new aspect ratio, so a majority of this special is stock footage from 2 episodes.
- Shandians are just there really, they only one of importance here is Wiper. Aisa is barely in this and doesn't even venture to Upper Yard since Conis is already there.
- Because of the changes, so many inconsistencies.
- Enel VS the Five Survivors is trimmed, but the important bits are there I guess.
- Enel Face is on point.
- The biggest crime of this special, No Usopp Spell.
- Sanji get's his sacrifice scene reanimated, looks pretty good.
- Though fast, the ascension of Giant Jack is good, it's nice to have that and Luffy's fireworks and golden rifle in one big scene.
- Special ends with Luffy's final blow on Enel, Cricket sees the shadow, Ganfall and the Shandian Chief say the war is over, and Luffy and Nami sitting on the cloud after Enel's defeat. I mean, you didn't even include the giant party or even the Merry falling from the sky, like come on?
- They added Ace VS BB to the end credits for some reason, looks good, just randomly there.
- They threw in the animation from Namie Amuro's tour for when she sang Hope as well in the credits, which is pretty nice.
- Soundtrack was nice, filled with the classics, but there might have been one new one for Luffy's fight with Enel.
Overall, I wouldn't say the special is bad persay, there's is just no substance whatsoever. I mean, if you were going to adapt Skypiea as a Special this isn't the worst thing they could have done, but it's not the best either. Like Episode of East Blue, this is not a substitute for the original Arc in the Anime and is more like a way to experience key moments with the modern animation. There is only one positive from this special, from the lack of fights and the heavy use of stock footage I can tell that Toei is not going to shit on the Luffy VS Katakuri fight since it seems pretty obvious they're saving their best animators for that and needed to cobble together something for the yearly requirement of an OP Special.
Final rating: Just go rewatch the Skypiea Arc because I know some of you skipped it, trust me, the Skypiea Saga is good and this special doesn't really do it justice.",False,anime_review,37902,2018-08-27T01:49:00+00:00
"**minor spoilers ahead** I've been an advent fan of One Piece up to the end of Dressrosa, where I decided to take a break. Hearing a new recap movie on the horizon got me skeptical as usual. Recap movies don't always work out well. And I was right. But this movie actually surprised me somewhat. Watching some of the scenes, I couldn't help get this craving to rewatch One Piece. the scenes they did include were phenomenal. The animation was well done, and the music stayed true to the old One Piece. I felt like a kid a again every now and then. But the rest of thetime, I was just confused. It really felt like the story was exponentially shorter than I can recall. They just removed so many of the iconic moments that made this arc so great. I mean, barely any of the crew had any growth, or proper fights.

So they got the wonder. But none of the suspense was there. This movie just reminded me of a time way back, when the Straw Hats weren't as unstoppable as they'd one day be. I mean pre-haki, where they were basically just fodder for even what we today consider mid-tier. This movie made it felt like Skypeia was a literal breeze to them. Take the ship, go to the cloud, beat a god and sail along merrily. Sure, that's basically what happened in the series , but it wasn't nearly as easy then.

In short, this reminded me of the adventures I so dearly miss years ago, but just left me craving for more then a simple drop of the ocean.

Overall, I give it a 6.",False,anime_review,37902,2018-08-27T09:05:00+00:00
"If you thought you could watch One Piece through this 1hr 44min long capsule. You are mistaken. It will ruin your experience. Let it be a newbie this isn't even fair for someone like me who is following this series since it's inception. It never builds up anything, just straight up bad cuts, no character introduction, random characters pop out of nowhere and just jerk some tears up on screen. When I first watched Skypiea arc, it was scary for the fact the main boss kicks ass and weird mantra power was a surprise. I was scared that Luffy will eat dirt this time. This 'Episode ofSorajima' should have been atleast 4-5 hours long to do justice to actual story telling of the series.",False,anime_review,37902,2018-08-27T12:55:00+00:00
"One common running theme with Toei Animations is that you will never get a 100% satisfying adaptation that does the source material justice, well, there are some very few occasions where that doesn't apply, like the recent 3 movies and some of the major episodes of the show, but unfortunately One Piece: Episode of Sorajima could not level up to those exceptions. Talking about One Piece, we all have come to know that the anime adaptation gets its share of weekly beat up from the studio, the Manga and Anime are like night and day, two sides of the same coin that's one is waybelow the other in terms of quality. Not even the original adaptation of the Skypea arc from the anime from way back had managed to live up to the viewers' expectations and was infamously regarded by a great number of fans to be one of the worst arcs in term of pacing. But at least, this special does leave you appreciating how faithful the anime was to the source material when the Skypea arc was first animated.

- Story (6/10):
We all know what the arc was about, so spare the lengthy introduction.
We all know Skypea was prequel'd by the beloved mini-arc Jaya, they just had to skip through 95% of it to rush into the sky island stuff, which is understandable enough, for instance, there are no light spots on either Teach or Bellamy, and let's, of course, no forget the two Monkey brothers that were affiliated with Montblanc Cricket, they were included on some still images though, but never were given any proper introduction. Not just that, but also many rememberable things were skipped liked the classic Zoro Tarazan screen (classic), and the scene where Wiper destroyed Enel with a reject Dial to only restart his heart and come back from the dead, we never got introduced to how the Skypeans live and how things are being ruled over up in the sky. Things like Ganfall meeting the straw hat and Satori fighting Luffy, Sanji and Ussop were changed entirely.
Everything felt very out of place and in the wrong chronological order, sometimes you're put into a flashback, and then immediately skip a lot of (important) content to only find yourself following some of the major battles which almost all were only still images, that looked lazy, cheap, and more than anything else, disgraceful.
One of the greatest flashbacks of One Piece, the one that tells the story of Noland the lier, for me, it was the greatest thing and the most interesting part of Skypea, also, the most one packed with emotions, but here, it was just, why even bother. The storytelling was just a bunch of rushed conflicted nonsense being juxtaposed, if anything, it made me appreciate the older Anime adaptation more for what it was, simple of its time, but still lives up quite strong to date, if anything, better than this ordeal.

- Art (7.0/10):
You'd figure that Toei Studio would put a greater effort into high budget projects like One Piece: Episode of Sorajima, but oh boy, not this time around.
From the looks of it, they tried desperately to adopt the pre-time skip art style into an older part of the story and guess what, the results weren't pleasant at all. Everybody from the crew looks super weird for the most time, especially Robin, I wouldn't call that Robin to be fair, some kind of imperfect clone maybe? Imagine mixing Robin and Nami together, that what we got instead, looking at her “circular” face was totally uncomfortable.
I was looking forward to seeing some of the big moments animated with an up to date animation, I think I shouldn't have had any high expectations, I knew the old stuff will always have a special charm to it, but this we got wasn't even close. At best, if not being skipped like Enel vs. Wiper, we got some lazy still images and that was that.


- Sound (8.5/10):
I've always enjoyed the voice acting in One Piece, now those are people doing their jobs the way they should, no slopping and no laziness. Not only that, but the majority of the old soundtracks that we rarely ever get to hear nowadays make a return, and a strong one in fact filled with nostalgia.

- Character (7.0/10):
I'd hate to give this any lower score because everything was rushed, caught up in an incohesive mess, no character was given enough time to “shine” so to speak. I've talked how the backstories didn't make any great impact, and for that, from a new comer's perspective, not a single one of them made the cut.

- Enjoyment (5/10):
Now, I a big fan of One Piece, and I'm not being biased here, to say the least. I can shove up my face any content consisting One Piece all day, that's how big of a fan I am. Yes, the special was disappointing in a big way, they cut off a lot of my favorite parts, and changed a lot of things that were perfect before, and as the people in my profession say (I am a developer); if it works don't touch it. That quote should become universal and sacred, it can rescue franchises. I had my share of laughs here, It seems the minimal remaining of humor did endure the wounds of time. Classic One Piece.

- Overall (6.7/10):
It all comes down to what you're expecting at the end. If you're waiting for some mind-blowing thing to happen, then don't. If you're waiting for this special to change your mind about the Skypea arc as a whole (because probably you're one of the people who didn't enjoy the arc in the first place), then it would most probably disappoint even more. But more importantly, if you're a newcomer, or a first-time watcher and still not caught up, and decided to skip the Anime arc and watch this instead as some sort of compensation, then I beg of you to not do so. This is as bad as a retelling can get, way more complicated than the Anime arc.
It was not one of the best specials of the series, it would probably rank down the chest somewhere.",False,anime_review,37902,2018-09-22T16:35:00+00:00
"I am a huge One Piece fan, so when this came out I of course had to watch it! But I was a bit nervous because it is called ""One piece 3D""... and my worries were correct. It doesn't look much like the show at all. It really resembles a video game cut-scene. Once I saw that, I was thinking ""crap, this is going to suck."" So if you're thinking the same thing, you are not the only one! Trust me. However!! After a few minutes, I got used to the art and started to pay more attention to the actual story. Which I didin fact enjoy a lot!


Story: 8 (Very Good)
Basically, this short 'movie' is about Luffy frantically trying to retrieve his hat. As all One Piece fans will know, his hat is very important to him! So of course he would go crazy looking for it, and the crew helps him as well... but of course for the Straw Hat Pirates, nothing is ever simple. That's basically all there is to the movie. It sounds rather boring in a summary, but is actually quite entertaining to watch! 


Art: 8 (Very Good)
Like I mentioned before, I didn't like the art at first just because I wasn't used to it. But once I got adjusted to the style of the movie, I started to like it. It was nicely detailed and their movements were much more smooth and clear than I thought they would be. I can tell the artists put a lot of effort into making this very eye-appealing. 

The fighting is also very awesome and well-done! Unlike some video-game cut-scenes, the fights in this actually reminded me of the fights in the show. (Zoro's fight was one of the coolest parts of the entire movie! If anything you should watch it just to see Zoro in action!)

The backgrounds are also very beautiful. The water, icebergs, smoke, and such are all very realistic 


Sound: 9 (Great)
The voice acting in One Piece is as good as ever! The voices of each character are perfect for them and are exciting to hear! They have lots of emotion and seem to put a lot of effort into making their character sound perfect!

The music is also pretty good, not amazing or mind-blowing, but it was still a good addition to the animation.


Character: 9 (Great)
Sometimes with One Piece OVAs, movies and side-stories, the characters are completely out-of-character and make me angry. Something I really loved about this movie was that everyone acted very in-character. Just like they would act in the show. 


Enjoyment: 9 (Great)
I would definitely be willing to watch this movie again, the story was great and the art was also very awesome. I only wish I had 3D glasses to watch it with, that might make it even more epic than it already is!

One of the things that really made me enjoy this movie was that we get to see all of the Straw Hat Pirates fighting together, which is something that rarely ever happens (a lot of times they're all off fighting their own battles). It's great to see them team up and work together so nicely! 


Overall: 9 (Great)
Despite wanting to give it a 4 after the first 30 seconds (because I was too quick to judge it), I really loved watching this short movie! If you are a One Piece fan, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy this 30 minute movie.",False,anime_review,9999,2011-08-05T15:04:00+00:00
"One Piece 3D: Mugiwara Chase is surprisingly well written, for it is pleasant and relatable, especially if you are a pet owner, and involves a goal that any One Piece fan knows must be achieved at all costs. It doesn’t try to be bigger than it really is. And it’s truly quite short, only a half-hour. As in the show, the humor is spot on and the character interactions are solid. Everything One Piece fans crave in the writing is there. Unfortunately, the 3D animation is disorienting and distracting, and did lessen my enjoyment of the film during times that would normally elicit a reaction fromme, such as moments of hilarity or action scenes that should be cool but just aren’t the same in 3D. The most awkward sequences are those involving the more extreme expressions often seen in One Piece, which are intensely amusing in the show’s normal style but peculiar here. Clearly, the style of One Piece is not suited for this alternative medium and I genuinely wish it was animated normally.

Mugiwara Chase is a lovely watch, but the animation can get in the way of the experience. If you don’t mind or even like the different animation, you will have absolutely zero problems with it.",False,anime_review,9999,2015-05-22T18:13:00+00:00
"Story (9/10) Great When I read the synopsis for this movie I was extremely underwhelmed. In my head I was thinking ""So basically Luffy loses his hat and he's trying to get it back? Uhh boring..also apparently this whole movie is in 3D? Idk how I'll feel about this.. I'm probably not going to like it.."" And with that being said this movie's story yeah straight for but the execution was great. I can't believe a movie with such a plot could be pulled off so well. The entertainment of the Straw Hat crew and amazing back and fourth scuffle/fight choreography between Luffy and Buzzwas done very well. Short and sweet 


Art and Animation (8/10) Very Good
More Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+

Like I said earlier when I saw the 3D in the title I got turned off quick. I thought honestly the first 3D CG that came to mind was the Kingdom anime (season 1) quality and it didn't sit well with me. But when the movie started I didn't think it looked too bad as a matter of fact I ended up enjoying how it looked. It reminded me of how the One Piece Pirate Warriors CG looked. Here's what the movie basically looks like https://youtu.be/qWeXpjiSzEs And as for as how it moves it moves quite smooth and at an enjoyable frame rate I thought they did a very good job.


Sound (10/10) Outstanding

The music and sound effects are the two main things in this short movie that definitely stood out to me. The background music for most of the scenes aren't something you usually hear from the One Piece OST but it still fits every scene perfectly. The sound effects on the creatures when Luffy is chasing Buzz for his hat sounded outstanding and I can't praise it enough.


Characters (10/10) Masterpiece

This movie is only 30 minutes long but they still managed to capture the good things about the Straw Hat Crew in the time that they had. At first I didn't care for the Moive MC Schneider but during the end you do semi-sympathize with him and his dog Buzz they didn't take up too much screen time which is good since we only had 30 minutes and they was some issues I had with previous One Piece Movies the movie characters are uninteresting and take up too much screentime.


Enjoyment (10/10) Outstanding

My enjoyment was at an all time high for basically the whole movie and I think the thing that did it the most was the animation and choreography given to Luffy as he's trying to get his hat back from Buzz jumping and swinging like spiderman kinda all around the sea, ships and other environments trying to reach Buzz was exciting and entertaining to the max. And when they actually made it to Mugiwara Chase the 3 giants that the Straw Hat Crew had to fight was entertaining once again. 


Overall (9/10) Great 
More Specifically (9.55/10) Great+

I am surprised this movie blew me out the water, it was extremely entertaining, short and sweet. This is how a One Piece movie should be in my opinion this is the 2nd One Piece movie (the first being Strong World) that I can highly recommend any One Piece fan to give a try and the fact that it's not an even and hour makes the person who is willing to give it a try end up saying ""Dang I actually wish the movie was longer"".",False,anime_review,9999,2016-02-04T02:23:00+00:00
"First of all for me a 30min episode seems like more of a special episode rather than a movie. The story is Luffy's hat goes missing one morning. He has searched all over the ship but can't find it. Usopp has an idea of the thief but no one believes him. So the search begins for Luffy's treasured hat, along the way they run into sea kings, navy and an old man and his friend. The 3D was a new twist to things but it wasn't my cup of tea. It seemed like they wanted to involve the viewers and make it seem like you were actuallythere. Most if the action scenes made me feel like I was on a roller coaster. Some fight scenes felt like they were made to be in 3D as you will understand once you watch it. 

Overall it wasn't bad, wouldn't mind watching it again but it will have to be 1hr long minimum.",False,anime_review,9999,2011-08-05T07:30:00+00:00
"This is my first review so be patient with me. The story revolves around Luffy who one day discovers that his treasured hat is missing while they are at sea. To stop the captain from whining (and since they know how important that hat was) the straw hat pirates tried to look for it only to find a pirate ship with an injured man on board. Reminder when watching this movie: it is in 3d animation and so if you are not used to this kind of animation, you might get disappointed. I loved the animation though. and that is why I am writing this review.To not let the ""3d"" in it scare you from watching this movie.

Art
For a 3D movie, it's pretty good. I expected something worst but the color and the character designs are really detailed. Let not the 3d fool you. As a one piece fan I still loved everyone even if they were in 3D.

Sound
The sounds and the dubbing Is still great as ever, I gave a high score for this.

Characters
There is enough appearance of everyone in the movie. They are not out of character and they are still them. It's just really cute that everyone would go out of their way to look for a hat. ""Nakama"" still stands out in this movie like it always does. 

 Out of all the one piece villains though, I hate this one the most (for now) and you'll know why… or maybe not. I still hate him though. 

Overall enjoyment: 8
It was an entertaining movie really, but not as entertaining as the others. Rather than a movie, this felt like a special episode or an ova instead. For something that lasts for 30 minutes, the story wasn’t rushed and you still get to see a lot of the characters. Overall I give this an 8. Not the best movie of one piece but it's still good. This is still something that one piece fans should watch and the entertainment is still there. If you are a one piece fan then this should still be placed on your ""must watch list"".",False,anime_review,9999,2013-05-19T11:48:00+00:00
"OH MY GOD! THIS IS RIDICULOUSY AMAZING! So the story is about chasing one of THE most important symbol of the series; THE STRAWHAT. It is the name of Luffy’s group and important part of their pirate symbol. But the most significant of all it is the most important thing for our beloved Luffy. And if you know or really following this series, you know that doing simple things like chasing a hat would be one disastrous yet adventurous situation for the Strawhats. Never in my many years of following One Piece would I imagine seeing it in 3D. This is beyond amazing. Not that Idon’t like the least the animation of the anime adaptation but this is really something.

After watching it, I was literally speechless. I was so blown away. It was a freaking 30 minutes long film but it felt like watching a 2 hours movie. This is what I am talking about. Just a freaking 30 minutes is all this series need to wow any kind of viewers. For 30 minutes long, it is so packed already with heart-pounding actions and exciting moments.  This really proves that One Piece is in a whole different level from any other series. I might sound so damn enthusiastic about this whole thing but if you’re a genuine One Piece fanatic, this is just so brilliant.

One Piece scratch cards are the good they are trying to push here, nothing too interesting unless you had some serious excessive obsession of owning everything One Piece you see.

Chopper and Usopp were there as well, so given how smart they both are (a trickster and a doctor), you'd have some more trust on Luffy's decision.

"The first One Piece movie, I must say, is more like a set of combined episodes than a movie. It does has the ""movie feel,"" in that you can see how the plot is going to move. You know, the gang runs across some seemingly unnecessary characters, whom later turn out to be important to the plot. They arrive at an island, explore a little, the villains show up. Nothing exciting, nothing surprising. The main enjoyment that I got out of this movie, was not the plot or the action, but the characters. Because let's face it, a huge part of what makes One Pieceso amazing is its cast. Luffy is just as adorably single-minded as ever (""MEAT! FOOD! TREASURE!""), Nami is still the money-loving woman we all know her to be, completely focussed on what she can gain out of the situation. Zoro, as unconcerned about the apparent ""danger"" as always, and just as cool and confident as we know him to be. Ussop playing his role with the injection of humour throughout. Basically, their vivid and expressive personalities are what made this movie, well, so intrinsically a part of the One Piece universe.

As I've briefly touched on before the plot isn't that great. It's nothing creative, if that's what you were hoping for. If you want something more interesting and inventive, I would skip right to movie four, if you want my advice. But for those of you interested in seeing every One Piece movie out there like I am, then go ahead and watch this one, it's not going to disappoint you. If you're like me, anything with those characters is going to please you, just because I think you could stick that cast in a cardboard box for all the plot you need, and still come out with something entertaining in the end. And after seeing the movie, I'm sure you'd agree: it's still One Piece, at the heart of it. Regardless of lack of plot twists or great excitement. And that's what counts.

Do take note of the year this movie was made, so that you won't be disheartened when you begin to see the poorer animation than what you might be used to. I had been watching the late 400s in terms of episodes when I saw this, so it was a shock to me to return to episode 1 in terms of art and animation. But really, it's not awful. If you got past episode 1 of the anime, this art style shouldn't bother you too much.

Music is the same as ever, the same battle music, the same great catchy tones that belong to the show. So nothing different there.

Overall, this wasn't the best movie, I'll admit. It had the feel of a quick filler more than anything, but I'm a completionist sort of person, and wanted to see everything One Piece that I could. If you're like that too, I'd certainly recommend it, because it still has the same feel as the show. Light-hearted action, Luffy looking badass, everyone cracking jokes. So yeah, watch the movie. I mean, come on, do you even need a review to figure that out? It's ONE PIECE.",False,anime_review,459,2011-07-25T11:31:00+00:00
"This is the first One Piece movie, theoretically taking place after Usopp joins the crew and before Sanji is introduced. Just like all movies, it is a filler mission with a good budget and a simplistic plot. And indeed, the story is just about the Strawhat Pirates trying to find a great treasure before an evil pirate crew does. Why? Well, the adventure sounds like fun and there is a kid asking for their help, so how can their shounen hearts say no? As simple as it all sounds though, I must say the premise is quite far fetched for the point in the storyline itwas thrown in. The treasure is supposed to be around 1/3rd of the world’s riches and the main villain has weird Dragonball super powers. It just doesn’t feel like that sort of grand-scale premise fits into the weakest and calmest of the world’s seas. This is something one would normally expect after the CP9 are introduced. Hell, why is there even a character called El Drago, when the main series already has Dragon? But hey, since when do filler movies try to be consistent? Anyways, a notice must be given to how the real form of the pirate treasure may as well be the real One Piece of the main series. Since Oda takes ideas even from these movies into the canon story later on, I wouldn’t be surprised if it is so. In a way the first movie may be spoiling one of the greatest mysteries of the show.

As epic as it sounds though, the overall plot is as I said quite simple and unimpressive, and has the usual kid asking the heroes to help out fuss. So you will just watch this for the action scenes, which are not bad at all. They are definitely longer and more elaborate than those of the earlier Ganzack OVA and there is even a mini-boss for Zoro to fight and show off his powers properly. If there is something I didn’t like is how final boss El Drago was being defeated constantly with his own power turned against him and he didn’t just stick to using cutting attacks. I also didn’t understand how Luffy could block or deflect energy beams but then again I am overthinking in a shounen filler movie. Let’s just say I didn’t like how Luffy didn’t really use any actual strategy in battle other than having infinite stamina and using the attacks against the bad guy. Cheap!

In all, it is quite the passable movie. The story is too simple and even out of sync with the point it’s supposed to take place, while the action, as flashy as it may be, lacks any real excitement once you realize the protagonist has plot armour.

And now for some excused scorings.

"The first One Piece movie was a bit of a surprise. I went into it, expecting a basic, unremarkable side-story featuring the cast of the show. What I got instead was an entertaining pirate tale which stands on it's own as a movie and manages to be well written on top of that. Characters: 8/10 The characters from the show are in top-form here, all bringing along their trademark personality quirks, and being written just as well as they are in the main series. The new characters that get introduced aren't quite as well written or well designed as the main cast, but they're no slouches, either.I thought they did a lot with the character of Ganzo, despite not having much time to develop him. Ganzo's son is a bit of a standard ""Little kid wanting to get into fights"" archetype, and the villains they introduce are also pretty standard antagonists. However, all of the characters fit into the story, and it makes things interesting for the duration of the film.


Story: 7/10

The story itself is a pretty simple tale about finding a pirate's lost treasure, and fighting a separate pirate menace along the way, but the way it's presented is very nice, with a decent pace, well written dialogue, and a nice flow between the scenes. There's a few scenes from the film that are pretty iconic and I think will stick in viewers minds long after the movie has ended. There's also a pretty nice message about greed in there at the end, and I think the movie handles it appropriately, only alluding to the message and leaving it up to the viewer to decide their own opinion on it, instead of shoving it down the viewer's throat.


Art: 9/10

The art is really well done. I've been a fan of the art style in One Piece since I started watching it, but it's a real treat to be able to see that art style done using hand-drawn cel animation, with a movie level budget on top of that. The motion has a very nice flow to it, the colors are nice and vibrant, and there seems to be more detail put into the backdrops than there is in (at least the early episodes of) the TV series.


Sound: 8/10

Audio is done nicely. With quality voice acting, and a fitting soundtrack for the scenes. The overall audio mix works well, but nothing in it really stood out as super impressive to me. The audio is just an acceptable sound mix, nothing more, nothing less.


Enjoyment: 7/10

Overall, while it has it's faults, and there's some parts that make it less enjoyable than the series, I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would going into it. It's great for both fans of the series and for those who have never seen One Piece before. If you like adventure, action, pirates, or all three, This movie is easy to recommend.",False,anime_review,459,2015-05-22T04:47:00+00:00
"One Piece Movie 1: (2000) Review Story (6/10) Fair The story is fine and simple for an anime movie is was fine and entertaining nothing more to be said he. Art and Animation (9/10) GreatSeeing that this movie came out about 16 years ago, I say that the art style and animation is definitely great not even the first couple hundreds of episodes of the actually anime look this nice and that's usually the case when you make a movie. This one movie even had a classical 90s feel and animation to it which I liked alot.


Sound (9/10) Great

The sound is great and I've been watching the Funimation Dub of the anime this whole time so this is technically the first thing I've watch from One Piece that is in JP and the JP voice actors for everyone sound great. 

Characters (9/10) Great 

Your default straw hat crew before they got Sanji is all here and doing their thing and they are just as entertaining as they always are. The movie characters were ok which is why I can't give this section a 10 because they weren't that interesting but nonetheless nobody was bad in my opinion


Enjoyment (7/10) Good

Now these days I can't sit down and finish a movie in one sitting so my enjoyment reached at least a 7 because of the straw hat crew acting like how they always do and making it and enjoyable and entertaining ride through the entire movie.


Overall (8/10) Very Good

I think for an anime movie this is a really good first movie and usually when it comes to anime, their first movies are usually like this it's the ones after it that usually are not that good we'll see how that turns out because I'll try to review all of them this one I have to give an 8 because I enjoyed the 90s art style presentation more than anything when it came to this movie.",False,anime_review,459,2016-01-15T15:29:00+00:00
"""The thing I devoted my entire life to, it wasn't the gold. It was the adventure to find the gold."" There's always a sense that a movie based on an anime series is going to be a throw-away story that only ends up being a cheaper version of its roots. As someone who has only watched about 50 episodes of the anime series so far, but is really getting into it, I think that does to some extent apply to this film, but I still think it's a pretty good One Piece movie, even though the title ""One Piece: The Movie"" is a bit too bigfor it.

It's another chance to see the characters be themselves, and although not asdetailed as the series, I think it represents the fun and adventure well enough. The new characters of Tobio and Ganzo are simple, but endearing, and I really like the resolution they come to in the end and how they both learn to respect each other more. I feel that it's easy in a film to have only the child or parent (grand-parent in this case,) learn respect for the other, but in this case it applies to both, and the ending is actually kind of heartwarming.

The film is pretty short, only clocking in at 51 minutes, including the credits and the opening song (the latter of which I would have been perfectly happy hearing in the beginning of all of the over 800 episodes of the series), but I think it's the perfect length for this series. Any longer and it would probably have dragged on. With this limited amount of time, the comedy is also a lot more fast-paced, and I think that generally works in its favor. The humor is crazy and full of personality, much the like the series, and most of it works very well. Heck, I even enjoyed how Luffy and Zoro are chained together for a decently big part of the film, and have to find out ways to keep progressing through the story while being in that state, leading to some creative moments.

I do have some problems. Two of them to be exact. For one, the flashback and backstory feel a bit rushed. One Piece is usually pretty good with its flashbacks, showing characters changed into what they are now, and how their current situations came to be. It's also very good at changing the character designs to look younger, but still recognizable, even when the flashback only goes a few years back. In this film, the characters certainly look younger, but all of the explaining is done through shouted exposition, which just isn't that engaging. It's a shame too, because otherwise their development is pretty decent.

The second problem I have is that the antagonist, El Drago, is phenomenally uninteresting. His very specific obsession with gold, (to the point where he doesn't even care about gems, only gold,) is never detailed or explained, and doesn't lead to anything at all in the end. I think the least they could have done would be come up with a funny reason for why he was so obsessed with gold and only gold, and otherwise there's not much to his personality. Even his special ability is a bit too basic, as it's pretty much just using his yelling to destroy things like the Dovahkin, (at least someone in One Piece found a use for their excessive screaming). It's a funny idea, but it's not used in a particularly creative way or build upon at all, except for a pretty humorous way for Luffy to defeat him towards the end. (It didn't make sense, but shut up, it was funny!)

But to be fair, the El Drago really wasn't the focus of the story, Tobio, Ganzo and the (supposedly) legendary pirate Woonan were, and I think their arcs were all basic, but still pretty engaging. The movie wasn't fantastic, but for what it is, it's likable, a decent amount of fun, and represents the personality of the series decently well. It's some more of One Piece to enjoy.

One Piece 2000 was most likely in production before many of the anime's early episodes. This film was created using the traditional animation process of cels and paint. This movie had a bland story which probably won't be valued by viewers outside of the One Piece fandom. The art was...appropriate. I don't feel like anything was missing. This film had some of my favorite music pieces. The sounds were fine. The characters were themselves and most of the enjoyment came from this paired with the great music. This half-feature is best suited for One Piece anime viewers and people who want anime under their belts.,False,anime_review,459,2012-07-01T15:56:00+00:00
"The main strong point of this movie is its style, common to the anime series, so when you watch it you're almost ready to believe that this is one more canon adventure of the Straw Hat crew (unfortunately, that feature is not usual for One Piece movies). And the main message of this movie - that money and gold are not the right things to value - is seen here as clearly as in the early episodes of One Piece (Orange Town arc, for example). If you expect the movie to be like a continue of the original story - you won't be disappointed",False,anime_review,459,2013-04-03T10:04:00+00:00
"Absolutely loved this. Was sorta debating if the older One Piece movies would be good and so far with this one, they are. If you miss the old art style/animation watch this NOW!!! was actually like a time capsule So many good scenes with everyone I loved it Its nice seeing Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Usopp just being goofy again, all the pre timeskip humor and stuff is there. Especially Luffy running on 1 brain cell the entire time lmfao I love the characters in this movie too, they are all silly, even the bad guys. Loved all of Usoppsstuff, bro was like the smartest one in the room this movie LMAO    ....  or the villains are just really REALLY stupid.   Even thought it was short, the Ganzo and Woonan backstory was really nice 

Loved the ending of the movie, the final fight was nice and I loved how they ended the story.

Cherry on top was that they played We Are at the start of the movie 😭 AND THEN MEMORIES AT THE END ARGHHHH  😭😭😭   Actually surprised me so much    have no idea why they played it but thank you

"One Piece Movie 1 Review By: Eiichiro Oda August 5, 2019 The first movie is where there's still only 3 crew along Luffy's. On their journey, they come across another crew of El Drago which is currently searching for the treasure of Great Gold Pirate Woonan. With the treasure map on their hands, they are on their way to this riches. On the other hand, Luffy and his nakama's been starving to death when three of El Drago's crew steal Nami's gold on their ship. The story goes on with treasure hunting and gold searching, written on the map. Since it is the first movie and it iskinda old anime, the animation is not that really good. But it won't lessen the excitement watching it, given that the anime already made the name for itself. Additionally, the main recipe of the story where friendship and pride of a man take place was really great. It was a film that took one hour, seems like two episodes with just a very short but meaningful story.",False,anime_review,459,2020-01-05T15:37:00+00:00
"If I had to pick a One Piece movie from the first 5 to checkout it would be this one. It is so interesting to see what the writers thought would matter or how the world reacts to stuff in this movie since it was made while they were still in the East Blue (pre-Sanji even). The core characters feel very nostalgic and maybe even a little off since there was so little material to base off of yet. The main plot in itself is a ""we have Gold Roger at home"" thing. They make a new legendary pirate up and the straw hats try tofind his treasure. Its honestly not bad since its only 50 minutes and not the standard 90 minute movies. This shorter time does mean that the main villains are just written terribly and have 5 minutes of screen time or less.

I really cant even say much more since it doesn't have much content in itself. If you love One Piece and are unsure of the movies, I would say to at least check this one out from the first 5 to see how weird it feels.",False,anime_review,459,2025-08-19T03:24:00+00:00
"Man, what a beautiful movie. It's the pure essence of what the author wants to tell us about the values of friendship, adventures, and everything else you can imagine. It's really worth watching not only the whole anime, but also the ovas and all the movies, to add great values and lessons to our lives. Definitely the best thing I did was stop to watch each one piece movie, I'm already looking forward to watching the others.

"Okay, so if you haven't watched the very anime of one piece, I suggest not watching this first. And if you had already, I recommend watching! This was my first one piece movie and to be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot since it's a movie and is non-canon. But 5 minutes into the movie, I was already laughing so hard. The comedy here is really gold. The very plot of the movie is kind of vague but is decent. I even cried a bit at some parts even though the plot wasn't really complex. Story: 7 (Not that deep but is executed well) Art: 10 (Oldart style of one piece, it feels very nostalgic + pre-time skip designs)

Sound: 10 (The usual one piece sound and We Are as the opening and.. MEMORIES AS THE ENDING SONG so be prepared to be emotional at the end)

Character: 10 (Of course, the OG: Luffy, Zoro, Nami &amp; Usopp are here. Kind of sad that sanji isn't here but :D)

Enjoyment: 10 (If you love one piece then you'll also love this movie. I enjoyed it a lot but really emotional at the end)

Overall: 10 (When you watch this, you'll feel really proud of what luffy has been accomplishing recently. This movie was done even before the straw hats have entered the grandline. You'll surely appreciate this movie especially now that luffy is currently going 1V1 with kaido at wano.

"I've only recently started One Piece and decided to watch all the movies along with the anime-- as best to the place where they fit in as I can. This first one was okay. Like, there was nothing about it that was really bad... But there was nothing impressive about it either. I wouldn't say the whole ""personal connections/ambitions/whatever else is more valuable than material things"" lesson was a bad moral to go with, necessarily. Interesting choice for an anime centered around pirates. But even that isn't super worth analyzing, because 20 episodes is still deep enough in for me to know by now thatLuffy isn't your average pirate. 

I guess my point is, I went through all the Naruto movies as well, and there were certainly some rough patches there. But sometimes, the rest of the movie being extra fun or lighthearted can make up for a weak story, and I'm not sure I'd even describe this one as that sort of standalone anime movie. It probably would have been better off if it was just shortened into a filler episode. I kind of would have expected the very first movie to have some weight behind it, but this really didn't. Makes it a little easier to understand why I had to go wading through pirate sites to even find a place to watch it. (I couldn't believe something One Piece related had never been officially licensed. Like, if One Piece hasn't been successful enough to get the whole sweep, what is?!) 

You know what? There was one moment that sticks out in a positive way. I really liked seeing the final fight, where Luffy showcases every single one of his Gum-Gum moves that the anime's shown so far. He's got a bit more fighting versatility than I give him credit for sometimes. So that was neat.",False,anime_review,459,2021-11-22T11:34:00+00:00

But it's done well, so it's not annoying. but where anime shines in the animation, it looks good, It has some smooth fighting, it has that nice cell animation looks, and you can truly feel it is the Dragon Ball movie team that is animating the fights.One of the joys about watching the one piece movies and the Dragon Ball movies, is you get to see the characters in certain power levels, just have fun Adventures that they didn't get to in the main series, and this movie you get that feeling, and that's why I will recommend it.",False,anime_review,459,2025-05-04T00:59:00+00:00
"ARITAKE NO YUME WO KAKIATSUME~~~ SAGASHIMONO WO SAGASHI NI YUKU NO SA~~~ I'm sorry, someone tripped and said ""One Piece THE Movie"". This is a distillation of everything the series is about into a (kinda) tight 60 minutes. It's very funny. There's action (that, tbh, doesn't deliver much even in the end). There's meditation on the meaning of life. There's emotionally wrought backstory told through flashback. There's spiritual victory clutched from the jaws of material victory. I mean, seriously, Woonan is a mirror universe version of Luffy, whose dream comes true only for him to realize that it may not have been exactly what he was looking forand achieving a dream ultimately means you keep on living alongside everyone else. That's such a fucking mood, man. Especially in the context of this series. So damn big brained. Wow.

Old characters are basically the same here, the art somehow looks worse than in anime at this point, main villian is laughably silly and simple, as well as his crew which are almost identical to crew from Syrop Village Arc. I'm not really fond of One Piece comedy in general, but here it was especially poor and cringeworthy. Other than formulatic but touching final with Ganzo and the last words of Woonan, all of this felt like a waste of time.

"I seriously have no idea who this was made for. I feel like it was specifically made to cater to people who have already swore off on never watching One Piece because of how long it is. And yet, those people still can't watch this as their introduction to the series, since this arc takes place in the middle of the entire series which means you still gotta watch the first 516 episodes that came before it to understand what the heck is going on. And even still, the pacing is TOO fast now to where you can barely keep up with whats on screen.Some footage looks flat out sped up, character interactions and story beats sometimes don't make sense because of context that was trimmed out, which I'm guessing they just assumed the people who've already seen this arc in full would just fill in the gaps on their own. But then that begs the question, once again. WHO WAS THIS MADE FOR!? Yes, I know this was made to give both Oda and the anime team time to prep for the final saga (which I still can't believe is finally happening) and this was just a nice extra to tide us over so we weren't without something to watch for 21 weeks. And yes, the new animation is spectacular, especially in comparison to the original episodes. But every single other thing about this edited arc was a downgrade in every single way. One Piece is long for a reason. It takes the time it needs to tell it's story. You simply have to be ok with that. Trust the process and enjoy the journey, rather than trying to look for shortcuts in getting caught up just so you can be watching something you deem to be ""relevant"". Just watch One Piece. Just try. The only thing stopping you is your own excuses. I promise you that any attempt at cutting corners in the journey will only serve to sully your overall experience. Just take a chance in starting, and keep moving at a steady pace. You'll be so much more thankful that you did.

"Oh boy, this 6 months break will be remembered, if not for the void us One Piece fan felt with minimal One Piece content, it would be for the fact that we were gifted a remastered version of the Fishman Island arc, in the Wano style. So many fans watered their mouths over this one when it was first announced, remastering none other than the cluster mess that was the Anime adaptation of Fishman Island, no other arcs needed a refresher more than this one. I guess, we can only get so high, huh. The remaster was NOT all roses and flowers, it started pretty hype andpromising, yes, but then, the half-baked edits were getting too frequent, hard cuts, non syncing sound cuts and way too fast pacing. yes, complain about fast pacing in One Piece, and with Fishman Island nonetheless.

"I'm really glad that Toei made the choice to remaster and release an abridged version of the Fishman Island arc. It was great to revisit the things that I forgot over the years and also see my favorite moments again. One thing I really appreciated about this version that by speed it up a bit, it made the pacing nicer and it got rid of the places that moved too slowly in the original version of the anime. However, there were times where things sped by a little too fast and I think maybe they need an extra episode or two to make the partsthat went a little two fast feel like they were paced better. 

That said, it still of course contained the pros and cons of the original version, but that was expected. I hope in the future we might see other longer arcs revisited in this format rather than trying to do something ""An episode of Skypiea"" that ended up making everything move so fast that it felt a little pointless and lost in the chaos.

"Though I had high hopes for this one, unfortunately it turned out to be quite horrible. Brainless plot, abrupt start & ending, bad use of characters, no heartfelt incidents, no meaningful turning points, dialogs that made me facepalm myself and so, so many coincidences throughout this movie. So many coincidences it's actually ridiculous. For instance, they are all on a huge freaking island and they just keep 'stumbling across' one another at the right moment. Nevertheless, the thing that ticked me off the most was that I found 0% funny scenes. Seriously, even One Piece Movie 6 had more humor and its basically a psychologicalthriller.

It seemed more like a really long One Piece commercial that a movie. ""Oh, look! We have all those cool characters in our anime. Come and watch it."" I mean they introduce a person like Bullet and he does absolutely nothing other than shout ""I strive to be the strongest!"" Sooo original! In addition, how he enters the scene is boring enough to revert your eyes from the screen. An otherwise stressful moment of Usopp being hurt by this insanely strong enemy, was ruined when it was not shown properly so that the viewer will feel fear or compassion for this long-nosed character. 

Fight animation wise it was... decent. A few fight scenes looked quite silly, but those were few and far apart. The final battle though was just awful. It was fairly alright until Bullet decided to go full Mechagodzilla style which, in my humble opinion, destroyed my already low interest in this movie.

This film could have had SO much potential (and I can't emphasize this enough!) due to the festival setting and the story of one of Roger's former crew-mates, but they managed to ruin it and create a ""stampede"" of already well known characters who begged for screen time and nothing more. Maybe this story required 2 parts and more time to do it correctly.

And all the aforementioned come from an One Piece fan that loves it since grade school. I do not know why I still keep watching this anime. Maybe it's the nostalgia, the need to know the ending or maybe just to see some random adventure of this crew. Whatever the reason, I always hope for at least a decent plot and not some unreasonable fights with gibberish dialogs like in this movie. But, alas, our beloved One Piece has already become another victim of exploitation and exists for the sole purpose of selling merchandise, video games and plot-less films.

"I saw this movie in Japan with one of my friends a few days after it released, so I'll throw in my 2 cents. I want to preface this review by saying, if you're not already a die-hard One Piece fan, this movie has next to nothing for you. Despite my fairly limited Japanese ability, I was able to comprehend the entire plot and the vast majority of the dialogue, (maybe to an extent of about 90% or so). I think the reason being is that this movie has barely any substance. When the movie starts we're introduced to the island and then the ""first event"" starts. Shortlyafter the battle begins the movie devolves into ""oh hey look it's [insert one piece character here]"" that character does an attack or something and then we get another character show up and the same thing happens all the way till the end of the movie.
I kept expecting some hint of story to be mentioned but it never really happened, aside from a few short moments.
The villain is highly forgettable and leaves no real lasting impression, even writing this review I was struggling to even remember his name, despite being able to remember the Z and Gold villains easily, despite having seen those movies a much longer time ago.

This isn't to say that the movie is bad, if you're a die-hard One Piece fan you will find enjoyment in this movie. The battle is enjoyable, the animation is good and the soundtrack just adds to the excitement.
But I think the lack of a decent story and over-reliance on fan service really brings the movie down.

For me I think the movie would sit at a 5 or 6. It's better than average and I enjoyed watching it, but I would be in no great hurry to run out and watch it again. And if you're eagerly awaiting the western release, and expecting anything more than fan service I recommend you lower your expectations to get more out of seeing this movie.

TL;DR The movie is severely held-back by it's lack of narrative, over-reliance on fan service and rushed pacing. Lower your expectations before watching to get the most enjoyment from this film.",False,anime_review,38234,2019-09-16T00:00:00+00:00
"Seems like a big cashgrab to me, glad I didn't pay to go to the cinema for this Movie. It felt like their Budget on Animation was just as much on this 1:40h Movie as on a normal 20 Min episode of One-Piece. The animations are horrendous and PC 3D animations are used waaaay to often, they didn't care animating many scenes. About 40% of this movie is made in some 3D software and not Animated. Very disappointing concidering Cinema movies rack in way more money than just a single episode. The character Bullet also seems like a cool idea also coming off of GolD Rogersship but his backstory and especially his Devilfruit concept are very bad and just made to be over the top. And on top of that he looks very bad in the Anime only being animated in 3D....

Consistency to the Main story is also close to None, for example with Luffy being able to Use Gear 4 Multiple times within 5 Minutes. Oh and dont even get me starten on the ""King King King Kong Gun"" or whatever it was.

All in all there are some enjoyable moments (Sabo and Ace Fire Fist in the end) but all the bad aspects of the movie push me to beg you to not support this movie in any way shape of form. Dont buy the CD, dont buy Figures of this movie etc. We have to choose what we want and we definetly dont want trashy 3D animations. Vote with your wallet and show them we want something better.

Story: 10/10
Amazing plot!
It really follows the synopsis. Oda-sensei did another something amazing! 👀 &lt;no spoilers&gt; 
The plot was too good while watching the movie. Watch it from 0(hr):00(min) to 1(hr):51(mins). 

P.S.
Don't skip any second especially the post credits-scene where people usually skip when watching anime 😂 
There seems to be a big clue or mystery that can be a hint in the future of One Piece

Characters/Casts: 10/10
ALL-STAR!! MIND BLOWING!! AMAZING!!
I'm out of words for this 😂 it was nice seeing old casts gather together here ❤ (how did  they gather those casts together here?) how nostalgic! 

Soundtrack/Sound effects: 10/10
Soundtracks and effects fit in at the right time especially in fight scenes!

GONG - WANIMA should be the next One Piece Opening Soundtrack!

Animation: 11/10
INSANE! AMAZING!
Didn't expect ""TOEI Animation"" could bring an animation like this after watching STAMPEDE.
Full of action and fight scenes.
Clap

Enjoyment: 11/10
I missed the comedy scenes in today's ONE PIECE especially the pre time-skip comedy scenes during the old days but they brought it back to the movie 😂
Every second was pure fun and full of memories. You won't be disappointed. :) 
Nostalgic ONE PIECE 

ONE PIECE is really a big part of my life. ❤

I want to watch it again and again.

"I have watched multiple time all the 14 One piece movie so far. This one for me will be ranked probably number one or number two (Strong World is truly hard to beat, but this one was also really power-full to me). Sadely I had to watched it in VO because I'm currently living in Japan (but I'm not a native speaker). I think I will wait one or two years... *sad laughed*... to watch it in ""VOSTFR"" to say if its number one or two of the One Piece franchise. ( ☉̅ 益 ☉̅ ) Its kind a weird because the only issues I can find in thismovies are related to the antagonist. I can't say much without spoiling so I will clause my mouse about it, but that strange cause often there are well made in One Piece. Not this time I guess, but the rest was EPIC!

If you like One Piece, I think you will love-it! ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

"Warning – this review might have some spoilers; you have been warned. One Piece is one of those franchises that is known to have produced many movies and specials over the years to make a quick buck since the series is so massive and popular, and oftentimes, those movies are either a hit or miss. Those movies can range from really good to absolute dog shit in terms of quality, luckily for us One Piece fans, this movie is not dog shit. Stampede is the latest movie to have come out as of writing this review, and thankfully, the gods have blessed us with good fortuneas the movie has turned out quite well. Now that I’ve ticked this off from the dozens of One Piece items on my list, I’ll go into detail explaining why this movie is one of the best One Piece films to have been released to date.

Before I get to the positive aspects of the film, I would say that the plot is probably one of the film’s biggest letdowns. The movie follows the Straw Hats and nearly everybody else as they all set out to partake in a festival just for pirates, a banquet of sorts and everyone is enjoying themselves. The festival is located on an island and is kept hidden from the marines. One of the events of the festival is a treasure hunt, and it turns out that the treasure everyone is hunting for can lead them straight to the one and only treasure that is One Piece. They have a massive battle with a previously unknown enemy who’s overpowered as shit, yada yada yada, Luffy defeats the enemy and saves the day, the end. The plot is actually very similar to a lot of the previous films, especially Gold, so when reflecting on the story of the film, I’m a bit disappointed the writers couldn’t think of something completely different, though it might be because it is One Piece and you can only do so much with pirates as the theme. I don’t think the story isn’t too bad, though it might be a bit rushed as well, if they did an overhaul of the writing and the story, the movie would be a whole lot better.

One of the things that keeps this movie afloat is probably the fan service with the amount of characters they’ve thrown in, as most of the pirates make an appearance. It was fun seeing them come together and fight among/work with each other, the film does feature Buggy and his crew quite a bit, which I have no complaints with. We are introduced to the villain, a former crew member of Blackbeard’s crew, and one of the prisoners who’s escaped from level 6 of Impel Down. He actually adds quite a bit of information to what we already know about Blackbeard and his crew since we know only a little about them, which adds to the lore of the One Piece world. Though he does present a challenge to the pirates and the navy, and since his powers were cool to see, he is a cookie-cutter villain. In terms of tragic backstory that sets him down the path of greed, evil and revenge, he is the same as Tesoro from One Piece Film: Gold. Overall, I think the characters were implemented quite well and their character dynamics were fun to watch, there were loads of gags and Easter eggs scattered around the film and the rest of the cast were good, nonetheless.

Where the film excelled the most is probably the animation and artwork, I think Toei pulled out all of the stops to create something that looks amazing. Just like the previous One Piece films, Stampede is well animated and has great artwork. Since we’re all used to the weekly half-a-chapter episodes, any One Piece content that has some sort of budget and time &amp; effort put into it will look good. Fluid animation and the artwork for the films will always be on the plus side with the films. They decided to rely more on the CG, which had it’s up and downs throughout the film; on the downside, stuff like the transformation scene, most of the giant monster scenes, and the tiny background characters looked out of place and weird, and it was a little bit off-putting, though the CG monster was used well alongside the 2D animation in most instances. The cinematography was really well done as well, whether it be the camera movement around the character’s body or the panning and zooming into characters, you will be impressed by how well they made use of the camera motion. Out of all the films, I enjoyed watching the fight scenes here the most. The Luffy vs Bullet fight is one of the better fights out of all the One Piece films, and probably in my top 5-10 fights in all of One Piece. Overall, the animation and art was great.

Production-wise, the soundtrack, the sound effects, the voice acting, and the ending song were good and did their jobs well. We get an original ending song just for the film, which is sung by WANIMA, which closes off and wraps up the movie nicely. The OSTs did their jobs in evoking emotional responses for the viewers, be it emotional music for the sad and depressing scenes or the fun and exciting music for the introduction or the hype and intense music for the fight scenes; the music was implemented quite well. I felt as if the sound effects were a bit better than usual, not that repetitive and bland sound effects that are played on repeat when characters do repetitive attacks (like clanging of swords) you’d see in the main series. For a movie based on festivities and fighting, the music is a positive aspect and is something that should be accredited for.

Compared to the other films, I enjoyed this a whole lot more. This is pure fan service for anyone who’s invested in the series and/or is up to date with the latest episode like I am. If you like to see fighting accompanied with excellent animation, and if you’re a fan of One Piece, then definitely check out this film. Even with it’s flaws, out of all of the One Piece films I’ve watched so far, this is probably one of the best out of the lot.

"I was wondering if there could be a One Piece Movie worse than One Piece Gold ... well, i was not disappointed ... :P Story: Yeah, they just wanted Godzilla type villain in One Piece, maybe.. I think Oda shd stop writing these movies ..i, sometimes, doubt his ability...because he is the guy who wrote such an awesome manga One Piece.. but when itc omes to movies especially the latest two (I have no problem with Z or Strong World (even though i dont like Nami))..Oda...well, creates a mess. Art and Sound were good. no complaints there. Character: Well, Characters were boring. there was no emphasis onthem anyway ..maybe because there were too many .. Being One Piece fan, i prefer Straw Hats not some marines or revolutionary army or CP0-9....Not a fan of Sabo or Lucci , sorry..Smoker is starting to get annoying tbh, especially his hypocrisy .. -_- .. i hope dont get to see him in One Piece anime for a long time...

Enjoyment: I was hoping that i would enjoy ..but i didnt ... experience was even worse than watching Gold...-_-

"Decided to watch for being such a popular movie even outside of anime itself. I can now say it is the worst anime movie I've watched so far. Considering that this was ""a challenge to the author to prove it's worth"" as I heard, just like the anime itself, this was terrible and a cashgrab. Story: Most of the movie is about trying to put as many characters as possible from the anime with no reason or purpose at all, random ""battles"" if you can call them that of them throwing moves at each other (or most of the times to the air). Story was non-existent at all. Animation: Laughably bad,some characters speaking or walking at 2 frames, crappy CGI torwards the end.

Characters:
The new one introduced is as bland as it gets, being there just as a raid battle.
The rest were just there and did nothing meaningful.

Conclusion:
Only hardcore 1P who would watch anything 1P related no matter how bad it is could have some enjoyment out of this, there is nothing of value here and definetly not cinema worth.",False,anime_review,38234,2023-02-02T13:33:00+00:00
"Alright, shonen battle movies are typically pretty garbage. This is not a good movie, but for One Piece fans, this has really good fanservice. The story is fairly garbage, but that's to be expected from shonen battle movies. The animation is either pretty darn good, or PS2 level CGI; it's mediocre. The music slaps, bringing the OG One Piece theme in to get us hyped. The best part, hands down, is the characters. One Piece has so many fun and great characters, and they come in droves in this movie. It might seem like cheap fanservice at first, but they all get their spotlight, makingit feel natural when they're introduced. 
Also the villain is garbage as well. 
a 7 score may seem confusing considering how much I'm ripping on this movie, but it really was a fun watch. It has so many great character moments it makes it all worth it.",False,anime_review,38234,2019-10-24T20:06:00+00:00
"Stampede is a One Piece movie that is an outstanding example of how to utilize it being ""non-canon"" to the fullest. So you can get much out of the film without coming out feeling a sense of disappointment. It's a passionate love letter to all the fans worldwide, and a damn well written on at that gets the point across and then some. Toei went all out with this movie and pulled out all stops to get everyone's attention right from the getgo. There is not a single moment in the film that I would consider dull or slow in any way. More or less,everything is high paced, and you are continually being hit by amazing spectacles one after another. It's gorgeous, both artistically and animation-wise. It is one the most eye-candy experience you will get out of any One Piece movie thus far. There is a fair use of CGI in there as well, but it was nothing short of top-notch, and I have nothing to pick on as expected. One simple and straightforward way to describe Stampede would be its equivalence to Avengers: End Game but personally for me a whole lot more gratifying, exhilarating, and engaging all-around.

There are in total of three movies (four now), which are considered the top dogs of One Piece film. All excel at especially one category one way or the other. Starting with Strong World, which has both a good plot and lots of slice of life elements to elevate the experience further. Shiki is a gripping villain, to put it bluntly. Then moving on to Film Z, it has, by far, in my opinion, the best story depiction with a better-written enemy. Even surpassing the likes of Stampede's Bullet or Shiki from Strong World if you ask me. Don't get me wrong here, though. I am talking in the sense of which movie utilized the potential better with the respective character. Finally, there is Gold that has some of the best slice of life elements among any One Piece movie to date. Not to mention, most interactions between the straw hats. Tesoro is not the best final boss. But Toei did a good one making us feel bad or pity Tesoro through short sequences of flashbacks.

When it comes to Stampede, on the other hand, it excels at the breathtaking non-stop action sequences. Filled to the brim with a pop of colorful movements with a lot of spice in ridiculously many ways. One of which happens to be an absurd amount of character they threw at us in this movie. Mostly all your favorites make a comeback, enemies, and allies alike. You can even see non-canon figures from other movies make a slight appearance. It's genuinely marvelous Toei, and Oda was able to accomplish so much with a mere two hours to work with. It's without a shadow of a doubt a movie focused on the fanservice above the narrative aspects, and it's done in an absolutely fantastic manner. In which case, the overall story or rather the main villain Bullet is one of the weaker parts of the movie in that way. He is absurdly powerful and impressive in any other way. However, his character is weakly constructed and could've been much more thoroughly fleshed out.

That said, don't get me wrong. I absolutely enjoyed all the fights centering around this guy, but I wanted more out of him as a person too. On another note: the pacing, of course, is fast, and I would not really consider this a downside since it's to be expected with a limited run-time. Of course, I would love to see more interactions between returning cast members just as much as the next guy. So it does suck we didn't get much screen time for many of them as one would've liked. However, in some way or manner, each character had some screen-time, even if it was not as lengthy, but still packed a powerful blow of impact filled with tasty spice. But I will also not let that take away all the other fun I had from watching this incredible movie. For instance, the canon stuff Oda implanted in the film was a tasty spoon of information and gave us One Piece fans new things to speculate on as a result. Not the most extensive in terms of information but something that matters in the grand scheme of things. I am sure us One Piece fans know a way or two to make few signs into a massive pool of predictions and theories. I have no doubt we will be able to make the most use without much trouble.

Not to mention, you get to relive one of the core things that makes One Piece such an entertaining and lively experience. All of the characters among so much else. So, in all honesty, I personally am not disappointed and was utterly thrilled. I had the time of my life watching this movie. It's definitely something I am going to be watching every now and then for sure. On top of that, it's without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite One Piece movie to date. I won't lie; I am biased by saying this. But this takes the top spot for all anime movies for me. As One Piece fan, I couldn't be happier about Stampede even if I tried. It's unquestionably the perfect movie that takes the non-canon element and goes crazy with it in many extraordinary and creative ways. One more thing I want to add. Please don't watch this movie unless you are fully caught up to One Piece anime or manga. It's a lore bomb and the only people who will genuinely be able to appreciate this movie. Will be those who have gone through either the One Piece anime or manga already.

Moreover, it's filled with spoilers you might rather avoid. Trust me. Some of the things in here you would love to have experienced through the main story. So, in a nutshell, if you are a hardcore One Piece fan, you will absolutely fall in love with this movie. If you are out for a solid story and lots of character depth, then you might find yourself slightly disappointed here. But please don't look at it negatively, or that's what you will see. Instead, immerse yourself in everything that makes One Piece phenomenal all at once, and enjoy the excitement it brings to you. Let's also not forget this movie commemorates the 20th anniversary of One Piece anime. It's a full-blown fanservice movie and a breathtaking one at that. I have nothing but praises for Toei and our one and only Oda for producing such a high-packed action movie. Delivers in all the right categories and goes above beyond to give the viewer a completely satisfying and thrilling experience.",False,anime_review,38234,2019-10-26T10:40:00+00:00
"[ First of all, this movie is NOT canon. Meaning that it won't affect the real story because it doesn't actually occur in the actual timeline. ] When One Piece makes a non-canon movie. You know that they're trying to flex their budget. The movies are mostly centered around high quality actions/fighting that would probably make any tryhard One Piece fan with Nami/Robin body pillow go speechless. Because it's non-canon. The story section becomes irrelevant and the movies turns out to be more centered towards pure action powered by the budget of the studio and the amount of fan-service they add into the movies. One Piece Movie14: Stampede blew my mind away with its fine quality and art style. Seeing the fight scenes full of fan-service. It feels so nostalgic that I sensed the strong feeling of ""I'm back"" although I am already caught up with the One Piece series. 

This movie was awesome like every other movies of One Piece. It feels nostalgic to see something like this once in a while. Really brings back memories from when I was a kid.

"Story 7/10 Art 7-7.5/10 (for the beginning) 8-8.5/10 (for the fight scene at the end) Sound 7/10 Character 7/10 Enjoyment 7.5/10 Overall 7/10 One Piece: Stampede is the 14th movie of the long-running One Piece franchise. Which follows Luffy, a pirate who wants to become the strongest pirate in the world, along with his crew, the straw hat. In this movie, the main antagonists are Mr. I work out a lot and a creepy circus dude. The creepy circus dude is holding an event where pirates gather together to try and find the treasure of Gold D Roger. Which piques the interest of Luffy and his crew. So they attend theevent, along with many other fan-favorite characters.

So you might be wondering what this show does that makes it stand out from all the other One Piece movies. To be frank, if you don't count the above-average animation at the end then nothing at all. It's exactly like any other One Piece movie, robots and all. Just a simple punching fight until the main antagonist uses a BFR (Big Fucking Robot) to try and destroy everyone. Which is one of my main gripes. The fistfight at first makes it truly feel like the enemy is really strong and is a treat. But after he turns into a robot it just seems clucky. It makes the fierce fighting at the start turn into a funny fight with a weird looking robot. But other than that I do enjoy the side characters which are fan favorites.

Conclusion
If you enjoy the other One Piece movies then you would also enjoy this one. Though, if you didn't enjoy the ones before then this one wouldn't change your opinion.

"A lot of people would find this movie probably just a big mess of throwing characters in from every arc and so not a lot of actual dialogue went on between returning characters with the straw hats. But I feel the purpose of this movie, since this is the 20th anniversary movie of one piece, was trying to fit all the characters in and bring back some memories from the pass and how far they've come. So as a long time fan, this movie was the perfect amount of excitement. I am bias so would give it 10/10,but just the movie itself I would give a 7/10, so my rating Is closer to 9/10. 
      The art was really all over the place, I can tell they were really trying for that 3d animation there, and included all these different art styles. A scene when the main villain takes his ""form"" , that scene was just straight out of like a King Kong movie and didn't match the rest of the one piece movie art at all, but it kinda worked for me? Like he looked pretty epic in that scene and it made me feel like, damn that is Stampede right there.  The fact that the art and animation was just all sorts of styles kinda made me feel like, ""Yup, that's One Piece for ya."" 
       Overall it was still good old One Piece. It had great comedy bits, and although not fully emotional scenes, they were somewhat present. This movie I felt really covered most of the One Piece journeys feelings pretty well. So nvm the story, it was just a fun get-together festival.",False,anime_review,38234,2019-10-25T21:19:00+00:00
"This might be the worst One Piece movie yet, not only because its inconsistent but also just poorly made, and despite being a HUGE fan of One Piece(see my review for the series in general).. I just can't recommend this movie. People call this an ""all stars"" movie. We get 30+ characters alive after the time period of Dressrosa to just have a fun blast with the action, not caring much about plot, and I agree, it's not the plot I have a problem with, but it's the badly directed action/animation with too much redundancy. Maybe it's because I'm a huge fan of OP is theproblem so I have high expectations, but here we go:

1: Stop redundancy:

Smoker re-iterating for the 10th time ""why do I have to work with pirates/these idiots?"". We get it already, please write something else in. This is also inconsistent with the character because in Punk Hazard, he set aside his differences to work towards a common goal without overly complaining about it. There are ways you can convey irritation without vocalizing it in dialogue every single time. Likewise execution of already known character tropes didn't hit me hard with emotion because they were poorly executed. There are entire unnecessary cuts just for a character to say what they're feeling rather than expressing it through action.

2: Stop unnecessary cutting:

Yes, there are 30+ characters that need screen time, but the answer is not to scatter action in every direction and cut so much that I lose track of whats going on. Some characters get weird small fractional slices of screen time and it's off putting. Why did the rest of the supernovas just get knocked out completely? The solution is to have characters split into unusual pairings, e.g Zoro and Killer, Boney and Nami, Sanji and Hancock, etc etc, and emphasize attacks/action in combinations, which not only gives us something new but also gives characters a more balanced amount of screen time and paves the way for more comedic/interesting interactions(since they only have Dressrosa level info on the characters).

3: Pretty animation is not fun animation:

Kill la Kill, John Wick(1&amp;2), Mad Max Fury Road, Kingsman(church scene only) etc are examples of media that have a very simple plot or virtually no plot, with emphasis on pure gorgeous action. Pretty action doesn't sell everything, more important is timing and framing. The animation was well drawn but not well paced is my problem. You can have media with no plot and all action work but this movie was not one of them.

Your mileage may very. This movie was released at a very bad time, where if the intent was to just show off cool attacks in luscious animation, it has failed. There is lack of information on new moves for Kid, Zoro/the crew, Killer, etc because not many of them have went all out since after the time skip. They will during Wano, so all in all, this movie should have been done after or sometime during the climax of Wano. I don't see the point in making a movie about the crew at Dressrosa level power because the previous film, Gold, already did this in a fun way. Weirdly I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was the movie done right after Dressrosa to showcase the new world.. but even then it doesn't fix the issues as noted above.

Things I liked about the movie:
There were some surprising cool moments, e.g with Boa's kick, that got me in awe.
Massive giant world being showcased.
The gripping thing in the treasure chest

Maybe upon a re-watch will I see the glory since it seems like I'm in the minority of crazy OP fans that don't enjoy this. I overwhelmingly disagree that this is better than Z or Gold though.

Because of this, it made the villain seem irrelevant. More needed to be done to the story. The animation was fantastic as usual. I've noticed they're using alot of CGI too.

"**SPOILER FREE** 9.5/10 Blurb: Another piece of the puzzle falls into place? One Piece fans have a hard time of it when it comes to fully expressing their joy and passion for One Piece. Mainly because after listening to us, the inevitable question that is asked is, ""So, how big is it?"" and it is at that moment when we realize that the conversation has reached its end because upon hearing the answer, we can see the expressions change from one of curiosity to one that is a mixture of disbelief and awe. We are saddened because our passion isn't enough to initiate the uninitiated. One Piece: Stampedehowever, is certainly a film for the initiated. It is quite simply a canonical film set after the events of Wholecake Island and before Wano and as such, the film can well and truly be enjoyed by people who've been reading/watching One Piece for a long time (at least from the Fish-Man Island Saga). The animation is obviously wonderful and Toei has done an excellent job of bringing to life a film which Oda wouldn't have allowed to be made if it wasn't for the fact that the film commemorated 20yrs. of his creation. And as a commemorative piece, the film certainly delivers. 

The standout however, is the story. The ""?"" in my blurb is for reasons that most fans will understand. Oda has a habit of answering questions that were never asked and in consequence he raises a series of new questions that may never be answered. Stampede introduces a nugget of information about Monkey D. Luffy's quest which might seem trivial (and almost inconsequential), but it certainly makes you wonder, ""Ok, so what else has Oda got in store?"" and there is no one answer to that question. And so, while it may seem on the surface that a new piece of the One Piece puzzle has been unearthed, the jubilation soon gives way to feverish speculation. And that's just par for the course with an Eichiro Oda story. 

My obvious fanboying aside, One Piece: Stampede for me is simply a masterpiece in a series of masterpieces. While it doesn't hold the same emotional weight as ""Z"" or has the flamboyance of ""Gold"", it is unique because for the first time we have a post-timeskip film that can not only be placed in canon but also provides information that pertains to the main-story.

After that, it is a succesion of fight and action until that bullet is defeated.

"*CONTAINS SPOILERS* As a devoted One Piece Fan.Toei did it again in the same year. first was dbs broly now onto One Piece. Story (9): The story of One Piece Stampede was something only GODA is capable of making it could seem so bland but oda kept us in check with his Roger treasure reveal. I was at my edge of my seat during the scenes where the teasure was shown but not quite.The villain was part of rogers crew so we had more insight how strong one of his crew mates could be. 


Art(10): The ART/ANIMATION of this movie had my eyes hooked for each milisecond of the movie. The entire movie is full of sakuga moments, Each Fight was Toei surpassing themselves in there previous animations. Each character had a distinct look to them and none of them were forced.

Sound(9): The music was phenomenal during fights especially the final fight against bullet. Played the most nostaglic opening of all of one piece which is We Are at the end which alone gives a 8 but other great moments were found in smaller area of the movie.


Character(10): The greatest rejoicement of all of one piece so far.
Litterally Almost ""EVERYONE WAS HERE"" Smash Ultimate One Piece Edition was the vibe the entire movie but missed a certain character like Jinbe.. All character's had spotlight and some were here for comedic relief like some buggy scenes, Ussop stole the show with this flim.


Enjoyment(10): This movie has to be the biggest piece of fanservice i've been given as a one piece fan. I Loved it all the way through 0:00 - 1:41:00. Has to be one of my favorite movies of all time and i've greatful to be able to watch it in theaters.

Overall(10): This has been the one of the best if not the best experience i've had as a one piece fan second to starting the series. Also caused the changing of my fav character in the show now ussop is claiming a spot in my Top 5. 10/10 WOULD WATCH AGAIN.",False,anime_review,38234,2019-10-26T14:18:00+00:00
"""Akhirnya, ada juga film one piece yang lebih bagus setelah strong world"" Itu pikiran saya setelah nonton film ini. Film ini bakal terlalu panjang untuk direview karena terlalu banyak poin plus nya dan bahkan gaada poin minusnya sama sekali. Pokoknya, movie projek spesial anniversary 20th one piece yang ditulis langsung sama oda sensei ini jauh melebihi ekspektasi awal saya. Film ini mungkin bisa dibilang hadiah spesial fanservice dari oda untuk fans. Terharu bisa liat semua kru topi jerami bisa kumpul bareng lg selama 1 frame, dan worst generation bisa kumpul juga setelah 9tahun lama nya. Lagu""nya juga bikin merinding haru. Jujur, selama nonton film iniselalu nyengir2 sendiri dan teriak wogh dikarenakan jiwa wibu wanpis ku terbangun saking amaze nya dengan film ini. Udah ah panjang kan. Kalo fans one piece udah mesti nonton ini selagi masih ada di bioskop, sayang loh film seepic ini kalo ditonton lewat layar laptop doang yang sangat kecil.

"Worst OP movie. The concept idea was once again good as a treasure hunt race, but then IMMEDIATELY discarded as a non-treasure hunt and replaced with typical shounen hero battle scenes (to no surprise). As soon as the treasure is shown, you immediately know what Luffy will do when he gets it... and then everyone is shocked. Characters: 1/10 The ""cool"" past characters that they threw in were essentially just there to draw in attention and acted as no meaningful substance to further the non-existent plot of the movie. The perfect example of my frustration with the characters is the following: A new side-character was introduced with anexplanation of their Devil Fruit, oh that's cool it MUST serve some IMPORTANT use later, no... it did not... it was used as an otiose summoning of a past ""cool"" character.

Plot: 2/10
In a nut-shell: giant evil dude claims he is strongest and they fight him. OP movies keep overusing this trope, but this was the most cliche villain characterization. As other reviews have said, ""It really follows the synopsis"", that is NOT a good sign in a movie. If the synopsis quite literally spoils the whole movie, there is clearly something wrong (if you claim the treasure was a plot twist, that is ridiculous cause it was clear instantly as to what would happen to it).

Sound/animation: standard for OP

Comedy 2/10: (which OP is known for)
The comedy fell flat as if they were not trying to be funny at all. 2/10 because the movie was so ridiculous that I found myself yelling AUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH with them as they punched for 15 CONTINUOUS SECONDS. True story, I was very bored and it was very funny.

The only 2 good moments in the movie was when the OP started playing (not a huge OP fan, but that made me tingle) and when a character was beginning to have an ""emotional moment"" but it was cut short to cram in more action scenes.",False,anime_review,38234,2024-08-10T22:19:00+00:00
"While the actual plot is pretty mid, and the CGI is decent at best, the reason I give this such a high score is that the movie PERFECTLY encapsulates the point of One Piece. At its core, it's a story about friendship, unity, and integrity. This film brings absolutely NOTHING NEW to the franchise. It's the opposite; it's a celebration of what One Piece stands for. Putting your life on the line for your friends, putting trust in others, uniting in the face of a threat to your friends' lives, and surpassing someone who is disrespecting your dream. It's all there. Luffy stays true to his character. From hisability to unite such different parties together, his determination to protect his crewmates, his unyielding spirit to chase after his dream, and even the over-the-top ridiculous way he defeats Bullet, it very much encapsulates who Monkey D. Luffy is. 

TL;DR, this movie doesn't make a lot of sense, but in every sense of the word, it feels the most like One Piece, and it captures that spirit perfectly.",False,anime_review,38234,2021-03-15T06:31:00+00:00
"The One Piece movies have built a notorious hit or miss reputation with a massive catalog of 14 movies (as of now), however, Strong World was a game-changer that led the One Piece movie experience from rare extinct DVDs to the big screens and cinemas, three high budget movies in a row, all highly praised for what they set up to be until Stampede came around and caused lots of debates in the fandom on whether it carried on the compassion from the three last movies or it failed to deliver an experience on the same specter of perfection and good ol' One Piece time. Story(7.5/10):
The storyline in Stampede is not the most captivating one, but it speaks so well to what One Piece is. It's an epic blood rushing adventure where pirates go head to head against each other trying to win a legendary treasure left by Gol D. Roger while the Marines are middling their way into the whole conflict. Basically, a free-for-all that manages to gather so many characters, some of which date to the very early arcs of One Piece.
What really made this movie so story-lacking is the amount of screentime that was dedicated to telling the plot, instead, it was just a massive bar fight, all for one with punches and cannonballs coming from all directions which little to no coordination.

Art (9/10):
Stampede was probably the best One Piece ever looked for 2 hours straight, the art of the character faces and postures was just right, the filter they used on the Wano arc Anime and Broly movie is very present too which makes the colors stand out more rendering the backs a touch washed off. The fights were slick and fluid, very good choreographed with good camera angles that balance cinematography and storytelling through sheer camera shake and 3D hackery.
The only nitpick here that kept me from giving a higher score was the average CGI they used on Bullet's powers, it looked very out of place with the rest of the 2D environment and characters.

Sound (8/10):
The movie did well with what it extended from the Anime OST and also the newly introduced track (Bullet's track) that added so much to the One Piece collection. The voice acting was good as well, nothing shy from the usual outstanding performance we get from the weekly TV show.

Characters (8/10):
This would have been an easy 9 or even 10 had it not been for the bad villain. This being a celebration of the entire franchise, most of the characters introduced all over the years made several cameos if not even heavily involved with the plot itself, everyone from pirates, marines, revolutionaries, civilians that we know was shown which was and still is one of One Piece's best selling points, no one is forgotten.
However, the new faces were not as fulfilling because the movie was supposed to be carried by them and the straw hats; but they failed to deliver, most of the blame falls on the amount of action which compiles a good 80% of the entire movie, which really ate a lot of time of what could have been dedicated to build up the villains and broadcast a more believable and heartfelt backstory, the same way Z from Film Z had.
Bullet felt more like a Dragonball character than a One Piece one, he was all bark and gains and no basis factor that drove the entire battle to be just another random UFC fight.

Enjoyment (8.5/10):
Most of the fun and enjoyment came from seeing glimpses of past characters and references to early One Piece, seeing a lot of characters that you would never have thought would stand next to each other in a single frame, the different interactions and combo attacks, it truly was a celebration that spoiled us the fans with some of the best fanservice an Anime fan can wish for.

Overall (8.2/10):
The movie was met with a lot of hype but unfortunately, it was far from delivering on what everyone was expecting, but despite that, the essence of One Piece was still present and strong which made it a sit-through with a lot of rewatchability. One of those movies that get better the more friends are watching along.",False,anime_review,38234,2021-01-30T13:00:00+00:00
"Every One Piece fan wet dream. So many characters, so much action, everything is happening so fast that you cannot see it all. Bullet is just your average meathead who knows only how to punch people and things. But what was intersting was the scene at the end with Roger, who said a line that appeared in the manga not so long ago, in a flashback. A stunning movie, indeed. The art and animation were on point. Beautiful, gorgeous, so many cameos. Everything that a One Piece fan wants. Usopp was the goat, Hancock is amazing as always, Sabo is a cutie pie and a badass at the sametime.",False,anime_review,38234,2020-06-01T14:11:00+00:00
"What a movie... I just came back from rewatching it, and looking at the reviews, people don't really get the whole point of the movie, or if they do, they're comparing it too much, which is fair. (THERE'LL BE SPOILERS, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THAT'S NOT TOO IMPORTANT FOR THIS MOVIE) I'll be rating it on Characters, Plot, Art/Animation, Ending? and Enjoyment Characters - 9.5: ---- THIS is the movies biggest selling point, it's a big goodie bag of practically every character that's been in the series so far, and it's FUN. Throughout the movie we're getting people like buggy, hancock, crocodile, and even vice admiral a, b and c, ithas a mix of relevant characters and irrelevant characters, and with the introduction of new characters, it makes the movie more and more interesting cause you start playing guess who, with who appears next. The characters in this movie provide the movie with a lot of life and enjoyment throughout it, and it works, I enjoyed every second a new character was on, so this definitely deserves its score, if that's it...

It's not a fair review if I ignore bullet and whatever the other guys name was, this movie (unlike gold, strong world and Z), lacks a good villain. Bullet is the definition of powerful for the sake of powerful, which is fine, if he had an interesting personality or backstory, however his whole 30 seconds of past was nothing compared to Tesoro or Zephyr, and he wasn't as wacky as shiki, so when it came to fights, you didn't really have a reason to sympathise with rocket, nor support him for any reason.

However, despite this being the case for Rocket, I still don't think it's any reason to knock the character score down much, cause this is a festival, as villain b says, this is just a big goodie bag full of fun characters fighting a big villain, it's just meant to be fun, so I don't think it deserves to lose marks for characters when the villain wasn't the main selling point.

Plot/Story - 8: 
----
IF I focused strictly on Bullet and the amount of questionable things that happened in this movie, I'd lower the mark, but once again, this movie is about fun and may as well be a fan story.

I guess I'll give you a gist of the plot for the movie. Pirates throughout the world called to a certain island where a treasure of rogers exists! Who will get it for themselves? Who'll remain victorious!!! Wooo!!! BUT WAIT! Big man from a certain important crew shows up and everyone teams up against him!!! That is the gist of the story, obviously the journey to point A and B is there, but this is all for the story, if you came here for some mind blowing and emotional story, then this isn't your movie, but if you didn't, then I'll explain what the charm of this story is in the next paragraph. YEAH!!! WOO!

This story is driven by a fan fictions what-if scenario, since every pirate came to get this treasure, that means a lot of your fan favourite characters, yeah! But that's not all, they have unique interactions with each other, THIS is the story for me, how do we defeat big ole godzilla wannabe? Easy, just get trafalgar law, buggy, smoker, crocodile, hancock, luffy and sabo, I know... a few weird ones there, but that's what this movie is there for, to create what-if scenarios and give you results of that, it's really just FUN, I can't stress this enough, this movie IS A FESTIVAL, you just get to see your favourite characters face off with each other against big old villain man, so simple that you're just there to enjoy the interactions with each other, so yeah, that's the story/plot, cool right.
(And yeah, I get you, everything I've said is practically a repeat of the characters, but that's what this movie is, so I'm not entirely wrong).

Art/Animation - 9: 

There's not much I can say about this, but what can I say is that I'm a sucker for thick lines, I LOVE this style, and I love how this is the animation/art in wano. Having bold lines really engages me, and it really makes the characters look a lot more appealing, and with the mix of black lines on a white canvas, mhmmmmhm, a blissful encounter. I really can't say anything more,  the colours are engaging, you don't get lost in the fight, you can clearly see what's happening, and most importantly, you don't lose that one piece charm, which is always a positive.

Ending - 9: 
----
You're probably wondering why I have this as a score, but it's how I just round up the plot/enjoyment, in other words, my satisfaction.
The ending of this movie was a blast, you hear the start of a familiar song, a weird and cool alliance is formed each performing their known movies, and BAM- screen goes white, black lines from impacts show, and KABLAM, satisfaction is irradiated. It was a blast of an ending, and don't get me started on a familiar fire fist, an amazing finisher to the movie with an absolutely killer ending song, it was a wonderful finish for the movie.

Enjoyment - 9.5: 
----
YEAH!!!!! Is all I could say during this movie, it was soooooooo fun, I don't see why people were let down by this movie, once again it's fair to compare it to gold, z and strong world, but don't do that, you are doing that unfairly, this movie is all about fun and the essence of one piece, a true treasure I guess, hah. Seriously, you can't watch this and finish it with an uninterested face, I'd highly recommend to check this out, it's fair if you don't enjoy it, but as long as you try it, all will be good, it's just like a big ole recap in one big happy movie.

Overall - 91/100:
----
So yeah, sorry if I repeated myself several times, or marked this unfairly/inaccurately, it's my first review, but my overall rating won't change no matter what, it was a ride, it was fun, and it's a treasure in a way, to show you how far this series has come.

Art: 10 BEATIFULL! Seeing One Piece with the animation that this series deserves tounches my heart. The fights are cool, movemet is fluid and considering how poorly animated is the main series I give it a 10. Sound: 8 Typical One Piece, realy good music, suited fot a pirates show, nothing really to mention on this. 8. Character: This is where the fun begins! So many of them! On the same island! But because therewas so many of them most of them didn't shine as much as they should. All other crews were outshined by Luffy, Zoro and usopp. They didn't have the chanche to fight the main villain... The clash between Fujitora and Zoro and the intervention of Mihawk was one of the best scene, they outshined all othe supernovas but Luffy. We got to see some old faces: Boa, Crocodile, Lucci and Sabo. I really missed them, especially Boa and Crocodile witch for me, they had sooooo little screen time. I'll give a 10, cuz i really missed that bastards!

"One of the best parts of One-piece movies is that we get screen time for characters. Now while it may seem preposterous in a1000-chapter story, there are simply so many things in this world that there isn't enough time to explore all these pieces in the story. And while Movies are usually non-canon, it sometimes feels good to see the straw hats just interact, as weird as that seems. They make Franky's SUPERS feel nostalgic, use the powerups and abilities they have but never use, and add that lighthearted feel we miss post-time skip, of them just being a family. And adding character development ina non-cannon movie with lots of fun cements this movie as excellent, even if one or two things are lacking in the film.

This movie's plot is nothing special and is driven purely by the crazy antics of the One-Piece world. Taking place after whole cake island and right before Wano (While still having all the crewmates and supernovast here), the development is around that area, while the people involved are slight plot holes. Drawn to take part in a pirate treasure hunt organized by the late Gol D. Roger, hundreds of pirates go to this pirate resort and look for this legendary treasure said to be Gol D. Rogers legacy. It becomes an exclusive pirate festival containing all the big names that will include mindless fun and battles. However, upon arriving, the straw hats find Law injured and realize that something is happening behind the scenes.

Now one of the best parts of the movie is that the world is more fleshed out. Due to the One-piece world's enormity, each island is almost a different world as Oda shows everything the world holds, while still being limited to arcs no longer than 100 chapters post time skip. So, Oda uses movies like One piece Stampede and film Z to accentuate and show the small details like the knock-up stream and leaves others like film gold to flesh out the world and its characters. The film has constant throwbacks like the knock-upstream, the bubbles from Sabaody/Fishman island, and the small bits of charm in the grand line; it makes the world feel lived in.  Using Buster Calls, talk of impel down, marine meetings, and characters we only saw pre-timeskip, it mixes nostalgia with intrigue, as the world just seems bigger, even if the island is a mix of ideas from other islands. We see figures like the warlords and the revolutionary army appear, showing that they still exist. Even Cipher pol 0, organizations we know exist, but want to see more action on. The movie helps build one Piece as a setting we know, rather than the literal planet it is, where millions of things happen in the manga.

However, despite the worldbuilding and strengthening, the movie's best part is that the studio seems to care so much. By canonizing the panda man marine captain, and the panda man pirate, it has that small hint, that makes it feel like Oda’d playfull writing. It adds small hints that most anime or movies would not  include, adding TO the manga, instead of the other way around (like the ""if I go to this island, I will die disease""). The fights and scenes were also not extended like regular One-Piece anime, as they used every minute of the movie for more action. It showcased moves like Zoro's tiger hunt, Luffy's Snakeman, and even Brook's spirit levitation, making a movie that felt like the director saw and liked the source material. And another component that made the fights was that the fights were not just mindless Sakuya, but Sakuya that fit in with One-Piece and had a purpose outside of a cool fight scene. Unlike most other movies that will Boost their protagonist's powers tenfold (Which one piece stampede did only a tiny bit) and make up powers, it took the same abilities and used them in the ways we always wanted them to be used in. Zoro had a fight that was not a 1 hit KO like usual, Luffy's fights had so much choreography, and each of the characters used their abilities in ways that were reminiscent of one-time abilities. And while having the main villain be a Level 6 attendee of impel down that was on Gol D. Rogers ship, almost beat a buster-call, stronger than multiple vice admirals, AND was an awakened devil fruit user THAT had mastered armament and conqueror's Haki, was a bit ""extra”, it was mostly his ideals thhat helped the show, as he was the trigger for Usopps development. 

The MVP of the show was hands down Usopp. I would never expect a movie to contain such good character development for a character, let alone a straw hat, but it did it amazingly. As portrayed in the cannon of the series, Usopp is a coward who is always fine running away when it comes to his safety, knowing that he isn't on the same level as Sanji or Zoro. But when it comes to the safety of his crew, or others, he stands up. Throughout the movie, there is scene after scene of Ussop trying to save his captain and continually being destroyed, blaming himself for being weak. He almost transforms into the brave warrior he wants to be, as he acts as the captain's right-hand man, ignoring his own state and helping Luffy in some fantastic scenes (I can't do it justice, but it is actually excellent). Usopp shines close to the level of water seven, as the movie can also be interpreted as his story. 

Using the movie as an excuse, it brings us screen time of characters such as Sabo, Boa, Smoker, Law, the supernovas, and even others, knowing that One-piece fans were eagerly looking forward to seeing them again. They each get small segments to star in and bring their characters' traits with them, not being eye candy for the fans, but the characters we know and love. While they aren't main characters or all have major fights, they get plenty of time to interact with each other and solidify individual bonds, connections, and ideas we had about them. They each act as we expected, but even better, as the few chapters spent with them kept an air of mystery that made us want to see more of the characters. Even the Straw Hats, given over 1000 chapters to develop, develop in this show, as we see them plainly interacting. While Oda will put chapters of them interacting occasionally, but they are few and far between, the plot taking charge. So just seeing the straw hats goof off and interacting without a heavy plot leading their conversations and locations just helps make it feel great. 

The animation and the music in the movie were the best One-Piece had to offer. Using the Wano arc animation and condensing it down into a1h 30m movie (and adapting more than 10 PAGES per episode), the movie felt almost as good as the manga.  And while the main villain did turn into a giant CG monster, the CG looked decent, as it was used with a good budget. With animation, fights, and pacing on par with the manga, it finally lived up to One Piece and all it can offer. Even the music, which is usually sub-par, does a decent job, matching the scenes perfectly, and feels amazing. It way outdoes the anime and gets up close with the manga.

 Now as good as the movie was, it was not without fault. The Characters involved were plot conveniences, as they all took part in the pirate festival. In the anime, the Straw Hats would be split in Wano and WCI, the supernovas either in Wano, Reverie, or on a sky island, and the marines(spoilers) on the warlord's territory at war with them. There is also the fact that there was an eternal log pose to laugh tale, one small fact I didn't like. With the path to one Piece revealed to be something entirely different and more interesting, I didn't particularly appreciate that it was included. Still, it was dealt with in a fine way, ending up a minor annoyance at the end. And even not being a guy who cares about power scaling, the fact that Luffy beat someone ""On par with Raleigh"" was also a bit weird, as we keep learning more powers they have, and that Luffy should not be able to damage them due to certain things we learn later.  But the movie's positive points shine bright enough so that they only feel like minor annoyances in the moments they happen, as they were mostly small technical points, rather than larger encompassing problems. Overall, it is a must-watch for a One-Piece fan. While manga readers watch the movies and are always disappointed in some fashion, it wasn't the case with this movie and felt amazing. And to the anime watchers who chug along at a subpar adaptation, they will love it. One-piece stampede does its job extremely well and feels cannon. With multiple feels, good animation, good pacing, and being the definition of ""fun,"" It will keep your attention throughout the movie 100%. And while there are small parts that seem weird, its positives way outweighs those, making it one of the best movie experiences ever.

"Plot - 6/10 Art & Animation - 7/10 Music - 5/10 Themes - 5/10 Enjoyment - 10/10 Overall rating - 7/10 I think to argue about whether or not this movie is good is unnecessary since theres a contextual variable to why some might find it garbage and why others found it absolutely perfect; it depended heavily on who the target audience was. If you’re the target audience, you’re going to have a completely different opinion than someone who isn’t. Although my critiques are harsh about various executions, it didn’t ruin my enjoyment of the show because of all of the loved characters interacting with each other. Like yes, themovie was a god damn mess, lmao. But it wasn’t made to be a phenomenal masterpiece, It’s called stampede for a reason and the motives were there from the start. It was made to put all the loved characters in one spot all at the same time so the fans could see them interact with each other. It didn’t go the way i was expecting, but the most important part of this experience was that it was fun and exciting. 

Plot - 6/10
Like i said, It was mediocre and chaotic in the sense that it was all over the place. But it was the kind of chaos that is normal for One Piece. The the concept of an underground annual pirate showdown was interesting, which was why if they had did more with that concept, it probably would have gotten a higher score than a 6. I think this would have made more sense for an “all-stars” movie instead of some antagonist nobody really cares about or have a special connection to. It would have been cooler to see everyone fight each other instead of having a common enemy that’s insignificant If (based on my assumption) the main reason for this movie is fanservice for dedicated One Piece fans. They could have definitely done more to make it interesting. 

Art  &amp; Animation 7/10
I actually really like this artstyle and its definitely a nice surprise/update compared to the series, though I believe the animation could have used some work. The fight scenes between the antagonist and the other characters were generally OK, but the way Luffy defeated the antagonists (stronger) form was unsatisfying. It was too underwhelming for what was supposed to be his defeat. The fight scenes between the other characters was kind of lacklustre too. Sometimes the art would look a bit janky which is kind of disappointing given that this is a movie. I also personally didn’t mind the CGI and actually find that the combination of 2d and 3d art can make scenes look interesting. CGI art can actually make things like antagonists or abilities look way more intimidating standing in the midst of 2d characters. 

Music 5/10
Usually I have a good ear with music used for OSTs, but the music didn’t cut it for me really. I don’t even remember any notable ones. 

Theme 6/10 
assuming the message was the typical “you dont get anywhere without friends” troupe, which although very overdone for anime; is not unheard of for one piece. It would have been cool if they actually explored the antagonists past a lot more, but because viewers don’t know much about him other than him being a villain for the sake of being a villain, the message didn’t really…pique any interest. 

Enjoyment 10/10
I’m not going to lie. Despite all the plot holes, the convenient coincidences, the mediocre plot and theme, i was still grinning like a cheshire cat for almost the same 2 hours, because i was extremely happy to see all of my favourite characters running into eachother and putting aside their differences and making temporary pacts to defeat the antagonist. I was still reacting to every plot twist, every advantage and disadvantage they were put in. It was still so fun and that’s what makes One piece so great to watch. It was nice to just be able to turn my brain off and watch some cool fight scenes while seeing my favourite characters interact. I’m so heavy on the interaction between One piece characters, especially when characters interact with Luffy because I think the interactions is part of the reason One piece has such a massive fanbase. Luffy is a complete dunderheaded and reckless character, but time and time again people are drawn to him; even those who claim to hate him when in reality have a very sore soft spot for him and can’t help but not fight back when he wants to do what he wants. I love seeing a group of friends doing dumb and fun crap together and getting each other out of a pickle whether it was situation they were put into themselves or because of Luffy’s antics. 


Overall 7/10
In conclusion, I averaged this score out to a 6.6/10 and rounded it up to a 7. I think this movie had a lot of flaws, but it was still a very enjoyable watch in my opinion. I think two things can be simultaneously true at the same time, though it entirely depends on you as a One piece fan, or a new comer coming into this. This might not be the movie for you if you haven’t really seen Onepiece before, but If you want to feel the nostalgia of seeing past characters in the series and just want an “all star” feel-good kind of movie, this might be for you!",False,anime_review,38234,2022-10-06T16:38:00+00:00
"This movie is pure adrenaline — an all-star brawl and celebration of One Piece’s legacy. It doesn’t waste time with setup: you’re thrown into chaos from the start, and it never lets up. The fanservice is cranked to the max, but in a way that’s earned. Seeing so many beloved characters clash in one explosive event is satisfying beyond words. The villain, Douglas Bullet, feels like a raid boss straight out of a game, and watching the Straw Hats and others unite to take him down is hype at its peak. It’s not a deep movie — but for long-time fans, it’s a 2-hour dopamine rush. Story:8/10

"Non-spoiler review for Stampede. First, I recently read ""Everything GREAT About Godzilla King of the Monsters! "" quote from tomato ""flashy cgi is not replacement for good story"". To which I think this is the kind of people who watch pixar movie and think Pixar formula is a genre that have to be applied to all animated movie. Aint need that to see characters beating each other in glorious Wano animation. But I digress Story 7 I told you I dont care about the story but I still have to tell you. Pirates gather up in 1 place for supposed Roger-related treasure, following that various faction alsoblend in for their own agenda.
Right off the bat there are 2 problems with the plot, even disregarding this being a movie. And no, swarming up for nonsense is what these characters do in OP so this fits well. Movies usually slipped/took place in middle of arc but this one have Luffy at 1.5b AND the crew already gather up and the Supernovas are intact. There is few story other than the initial race to treasure hunt and then we are left with each faction reaction against the villain next reveal. I guess that is still engaging instead of the usual exploration/adventure.

Characters 9
 In this movie the characters are on characters, thankfully no one act exaggerated (unlike that 1 horror OP movie). This is why people seek movie, OVA, spinnoff and doujinshi:  you would imagine ""this is what a character would do if they were in this situation"".
 The main villain is bullet, his background is bring up at 3/4 mark of the movie. It justify why such a strong character only appear now, after fighting Supernovas. Also Per usual OP movie we got an additional DV user as side haracter but this one plays out well in the end.
But the main reason is the amount of players this movie involve in less than 2 hours. Have you seen the trailer?

Pace 5
This is Like MTG's War of the Spark novel by Greg Weisman: It is sluggish because this movie keep describing who is who even to some catchphrases. In some instances it work because we see Bullet recognize the rank of who he fight against.

(Idle) Animation 6+1
Right off the bat you can notice the brush-like edge for character design that they use in weekly anime. It looks low-budget at time, nothing fancy for a movie

Fighing (Animation) 8
Animation flow is energetic like typical movie. When they fight, the pace increase more than the anime. It feels really exciting especially when you remember we dont get many action beteren heavy hitters these past 3 months.
CGI is used to animate the villain's power looks awesome even in dark hue and they manage to make distinct movement among full black haki. This carries to the hand drawing.

Soundtrack 6+1
Standard movie soundtrack, good but not memorable. Music fit the theme and help setting atmosphere and theh carry the anime sound effect. Arittakeno yume o kaki atsume!

Final verdict 8,5
Bring your friend to watch and have fun with the hype. But not worth rewatching in cinema or buying BD.",False,anime_review,38234,2019-09-27T01:33:00+00:00
"Well, le'ts just say that my father asked me if watching a movie from One Piece would give him an ideia about the story and characters and i (who is totaly lost in track about the series) just said that it would give him a hint about the vibe the series gives and well, he liked it. The man is not going to give the anime and it's 1.000 episodes a try but liked the pirates thing and for me, this counts. Heh. Not that i reccomend the movie but to someone that was lost in the Water Seven arc, seeing a lot of oldfaces brought me a certain joy.",False,anime_review,38234,2023-03-19T00:10:00+00:00
"This was definitely a good time. Got to show off much of the roster of characters, even if many of them didn't get much characterization and the entire idea that they come to this island all together feels a bit farfetched (and if they do, the absence of the Yonkou and several notable Shichibukai feels more than a little strange). Still, it's One Piece and not everything needs to make sense to have a good time. That being said, maybe it's just me being tired of this particular kind of villain, but ""very strong"" and ""has an independent streak"" just isn't enough characterization for me tobe interested. That might not be particularly fair, since the last One Piece movie I saw was Z, and Zephyr was the peak of One Piece movie villains. Still, Bullet is about as interesting as Shiki, which is to say that he has a history in the world that has some meaning, but that's about it. He's just an obstacle in the way of becoming Pirate King.

Still, this movie has a lot going for it. We get some really interesting team-ups, including a big fight involving all the Worst Generation and a rather disparate group of characters from every corner of the world that would never team up under other circumstances. It's nice to see how that latter team-up plays out, and though the former is fun, it feels largely just like a lesser version of their desperate fight against Kizaru in the main series. In all cases, though, the animation is dynamic and colorful. There's a lot to love about these fight scenes and how they amp them up - you can really see what led into the glory that is the Wano Arc. Probably its best moments, though, come from Usopp and Luffy themselves, though I won't spoil those. Overall, it's better than the average One Piece movie, but not as special as I was hoping to see.",False,anime_review,38234,2023-08-01T20:29:00+00:00
"I have to give credit for trying to craft a filler movie with as many well-known characters as possible, especially ones as richly developed as that of One Piece. However, rather then exploiting this angle for an incredibly engrossing star-studded story to match the scope of such a film, the creators have gone for a feature-length smack-down brawlfest featuring everyone vs. cliche’ filler villain. Why does he wanna beat the snot out of everyone? Who cares, watch! I have no problem with movies that want to be just one big (very long) fight. I absolutely loved the well-choreographed and stunningly animated Dragon Ball Super: Broly,which managed to be emotionally-involving underneath all the swinging fists and laser-beams. This time however, the devil was definitely not in the details. Important characters are pushed aside to do absolutely nothing important while others show up for a quick cameo and are then instantly shoved aside. It’s hard not to feel like this was a colossal waste of potential. Then again, there are probably some who would love nothing better than to see all their favorite characters go up against a big bad for 100 minutes. I just prefer a little meat to go with my gravy.",False,anime_review,38234,2022-03-30T22:00:00+00:00
"This movie is made entirely for One Piece fans. It is nothing but shameless fanservice from start to end and as a One Piece fan I liked this film, even though it’s impossible to miss some of its glaringly CG issues. I fell behind in One piece around volume 66 which means that I’m about 300 chapters behind where things are currently, but it’s One Piece so that shouldn’t matter too much. Once you have a basic understanding of the premise you can get the gist of what’s going on, it’s not exactly complicated. Some guys like each other, some guys don’t, the straw hats arethe main characters and Buggy the Clown is the most evil, vile, despicable villain in all of anime – no, all of cinema.

There really isn’t much else to say. This film was like 90% fighting a guy who’s really big and really bad. It’s full of callbacks, weird team ups, Usopp hype, Luffy hype and if hearing that 1st op be played again didn’t stir something inside you than its not too late to start. Start putting some bullets in your head-

"When I saw the poster I was very excited to see the movie, like I never had hope this big for an anime movie before, but turns out, this really disappointed me. Lacks protagonism, clickbait fanservice, absurd typical cliche antagonist. I really wish it was the Worst Gen vs Bullet, instead of some mixed random significant characters teaming up. And the characters portrayed still can't discover new ""techniques"" in their power etc (in combat meaning, idk if this makes sense). It's just inconsistent. And also I DESPISE the ending when Luffy crushed the laugh tale. The only good thing about this movie is animation, CGI,outfits design, and... yeah I think only that.

Overall: Waste of time. I think people only enjoy it because of the hype animation, CGI, fanservice, promotion vid and posters. The director and staff waste so many frames for annoying unnecessary fanservice.",False,anime_review,38234,2021-08-10T08:40:00+00:00
"Where do I begin? I'm probably extremely biased since One Piece is the air that I breathe, so keep that in mind when reading this review. This isn't exactly a movie that's purpose is to gather more fans either, it's more for current fans, what with all the older and smaller characters it brings in. I watched it in HD, so the art for me was just as good as some of top ranking One Piece films that came before this one. I saw some people didn't like the art or effects but I thought it was the same high quality as the other movies. Thecolors were vibrant, and it all seemed as high quality as one would expect from this kind of movie. I will say Gold and Z probably did understand how to contrast colors better to make scenes pop, so maybe that's where people were having trouble?

Sound was great, lot of great voice acting and music hit right where it was needed. Some kind of carnal joy is invoked from hearing the original opening theme when Luffy is kicking butt, words can't describe it.

I never expect a solid plot when watching an anime movie, but for critiquing purposes, the plot is about an 8 for me. It's not a full on 10, because the backstory for the villain isn't really developed and we only get one emotion from him throughout the movie. It would've been nice to see some of the other characters more included, and hearing their experiences when everything is going crazy. I'm lenient on deducting points for this, however, due to timing. It's a movie, and I doubt they want to make it two to three hours long. This isn't Lord of the Rings, or Avengers. The plot is constantly moving, always something happening to get it to the next scene, so it keeps you invested. Otherwise, the plot does its job, and I'm already a One Piece fan, so of course I'm going to watch it.

In terms of characters, I already know the characters, but if someone who doesn't know the characters tries to watch this movie, they may be confused, but I don't care. As far as I'm concerned, movies for popular anime aren't about bringing in new fans as much as servicing the current fans. I think they were all true to their character, and if you don't know who they are, tough luck, should probably watch the anime before the movie then.

Possible spoilers: *I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, there were plenty of moments that sped up my heart rate. It was interesting to see Luffy acting on a team outside his crew to defeat the main antagonist. It was a ragtag team that I love, and it's a really nice dynamic to experience. All the Easter eggs were great, seeing old characters in the background... I counted like 5 different Pandamen throughout the film. What truly brought me the greatest joy was seeing the Worst Generation acting in a movie. I love Kid, and I want to see more of him and his story. We'll have to wait and see what Oda has in store though.*

Overall, I thought the movie was outstanding, as it kept me interested and entertained throughout. Sure, plot and character development could've been more fleshed out, but I'm sure they didn't want to make it a long movie, so I'm not gonna nail them for it. Enjoyment was at all time high. I've already rewatched it due to how enjoyable it is.",False,anime_review,38234,2020-05-19T00:14:00+00:00
"Before saying anything bad about this movie, I gotta give credit to it first. I love how they included so many characters you havent seen for 100x episodes. The fight scences were looking very good, the overall animation as well. But, I didnt get the ""One Piece vibes"" from this movie. It was like a damn long fighting scene in my opinion. And because there were so many charcters, there was no screen time for any serious interactions between them. I had the feeling that they just wanted to throw as many characters as possible in there so you can attract many viewers. !SPOILER! For example, Luffy wasmeeting Sabo again, his brother he doesnt see often. The interactions were no longer than:
""Hey Sabo!""
""Hey Luffy!""
-End

This whole movie, Luffys just fighting Bullet, Sanji and Zoro out there for some little clashes that last a couple of seconds, but look dope. And the other strawhats ( except Ussop the GOD ) are just running around doing pretty much nothing.

!SPOILER END!

The Story was just poor, and I miss the typical ""One Piece adventure feeling"" in this movie. It was just a long decent fight, but it was still enjoyable. 
However, there are definetly better OP movies out there.

A decent enjoyable movie:

"Pretty disappointed in this movie, because I know One Piece can do better than this. The entire plot was just a sorry excuse to use every single character in the series without any explanation what so ever. In fact, most of them just straight up make no sense, why tf is Wapol here, isnt he a king again? And i am by no means an animation snob, but seriously, there is way to much terrible cgi animation to forgive. There is no comedy, and overall not much to enjoy about the movie other than the fanfare, which doesn't feel exciting because it has no lore to backit up.

"Having a separate entry because of technicality rather than being what would most call an anime, these short clips are a public service announcement with One Piece characters. Visually it’s quite simple, one background for all of these shorts, and not much movement animation. It’s also very short, but that’s kinda given, being just and announcement. Content-wise, it’s a nice attempt to make normally boring infodumping a bit more entertaining. You also have to keep in mind that this is obviously aimed at the younger audience. I’m sure someone somewhere should object to One Piece characters being mouthpiece for unrelated announcements, but “wash your hands, sleepwell” isn’t any nefarious message to convey.

It’s really hard to judge this as an anime, but if judged as a PSA, it’s quite alright, better than most even. So, fine it is.",False,anime_review,51163,2022-03-07T02:38:00+00:00
"Very cute alignment of check-ins with the Strawhats, I appreciate this gesture from the animation studio, taking advantage of their platform and reach to spread awareness of this horrible virus. A true virtue that others should learn to apply. It was cool to see Chopper give actually real-world medical advice, although, it felt very weird to have Zoro give advice too, and Franky who's already a Cyborg as well, but the fact that he operated on himself and rebuilt almost his entire body must have taken a lot of medical knowledge, and oh, of course, the man already dead, Brook.",False,anime_review,51163,2022-05-08T12:36:00+00:00

This short film is only 10 minutes and uses way more 3D techniques which makes the film very cramped. It was difficult to find out what this was made for but it leads towards a similar kind of roller coaster as a promotional material for it rather than just a random short film.

"Enjoyable, Emotional, Engaging and the type of movie where you can't help but smile while watching. It is narratively quite unique in comparison to other one piece films but it showcased the ability to highlight the character of Uta and the magical world of film red to a perfect level while also being able to combine many elements of what we love about one piece such as the same enjoyable cast as usual, occasional nice comedic bits, great fight scenes, scenes that are hype , scenes that are emotional and a nice setting and moments which make you grateful to be a fan ofthe series. 

A pretty significant direction style that can be noticed is the large amount of music present in the movie and how ""music-based"" it is. In many cases, it can be a fair point that an incredibly large amount of seven songs is too much but the way Film Red is directed and presented, this would be far from the truth because the music is not only a key part of Uta but the movie as a whole.  Everything was paced to a good level and there were never those moments where you are awkwardly staring at the screen wondering ""what is even going on?"".  Due to the fact that it is connected to a full anime series, It is also naturally done in a way for one piece fans to enjoy it. It is a one piece movie after all so it makes sense for the target audience to be big fans of this series. 

When it came to the peaks and the ending moments, Film Red knew how to do it. 



In terms of Art and Animation, it can be a extremely fair statement to say it is the best one piece movie when it comes to it. There is some CGI in some bits here and there but that's about the most that can be criticized because almost everything is perfect visually. Every fight scene looks incredible, the art style and top tier animation is not only beautiful but consistent throughout the movie and it undoubtedly is one very strong point out of many strong points that Film Red has to offer.


Music Wise, It is one of the easiest 10/10's I will ever give. Maybe even the easiest ever. Like said earlier, Music is a crucial part of the story and Film Red does this perfectly. There are seven songs in the movie all sung by the fantastic Ado. Once again.. SEVEN songs. Which is a pretty large amount when it comes to songs used in a movie. With that said, it might be assumed there would be one song that's not so good. This is not the case because although music is subjective, each song was quite perfect for the scene they played in, the role it had in the movie and how it contributed. I am actually a big fan of Ado and her music, so music-wise it was as perfect as it could possibly get. There was even an interview where it stated there was supposed to be an audition for the singing voice of Uta but when Ado showed up, the audition was ended because everyone quickly knew Ado would be the one. And they were right. Because it couldn't have been better. 

Even outside of Ado's fantastic vocals, many great artists and producers were also part of the music and it's a list that includes names such as Yasutaka Nakata, Mrs. Green Apple , Vaundy, Fake Type., Yuta Orisaka, Motohiro Hata and the great Hiroyuki Sawano.
The people working on Film Red understood the significance of music in the movie perfectly and it showed. 


Character Wise, Uta and Shanks would of course be the main talking points and Uta specifically was a great presence in the movie. She was likable, intriguing backstory, her voice actor and the singing voice were perfect, has a great character design and has links to a classic beloved character. She had lots of focus in the movie and her character arc from start to finish was handled quite well.  Shanks is obviously the poster boy of the movie and thankfully, getting to see Shanks with more than 1 minute of screen time was a joy.  When I first saw promotional posters and character images, I was initially afraid there would be too many characters and too many that do nothing and add nothing and don't get that much screen time compared to what we may have expected. To be completely honest, there are actually characters that may fall under that definition but it is nothing major enough to be considered a big flaw or anything that kills off enjoyment. More importantly, the major characters that had significance in the movie all shined and had their memorable moments. 


Ultimately, it is a film that can be enjoyed by many and shows quality in many forms whether it be the visuals, it's premise, the songs and the fact that it is a one piece movie like no other and although advertised and is pretty much non-canon, it does have links and large hints to canon information for the future. A memorable experience and a whole lot of fun to watch from start to finish.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-08-08T01:28:00+00:00
"First off, I would like to acknoledge the fact this is a non-canon movie althought we will get back to this. It's non canonness doesn't change the fact that, althought being a movie that doesn't inscribe in any timeline, it's still pretty incoherent. The movie is a huge purge to watch and I have seen a lot of people online stating that this is an incredible movie, they should use those words more carefully. This movie has a lot of objective flaws that are not my opinion that are simply made here to attract the fans. At out the way, I would like to talk aboutthe good part of this movie. Some of the songs are great. UTA's singer does a pretty good job. She sings pretty well and some of the songs are a BOP. BUT, most of the songs are those kind of ""disney princess"" song where the caracter just talk about her fellings and it's really cliche.

Now that i talked about what I liked, let's talk about what's not to like in this movie. And for a movie starring Shanks, It was clear that there would be some fan service, but damn. This is my main issues with the movie. It has numerous, to say the least, fan service that are for most, caracters doing cameos. We have caracters taking part in the film that are neither pertinent nor justified. The movie has plenty of caracters that are like this. It is clearly made just to attract the fan boys and nothing else. You can seriously wipe out half the cast and the movie doesn't change. It's like the infinity war of one piece but not in a good way. You also have elements that are still not in the anime nor the manga that appair in the movie. It's just here to spoil the anime and this not good at all. 

Also, another thing you can add that's pretty funny. One Piece's (the anime) biggest flaw is it's pacing. And right here the pacing is horrible. Everything happen really fast and you have things just coming out of everywhere. For the first hour, you just altenate beetween UTA singing and the lore of the island being explained to you. So you have all of these caracters that are completely disconected with the events that come here and just explain the lore and then she starts singing again. And another one comes and then she sings again. The ending happens also so fast you don't see it coming, not in a good way of course.

Furthermore, the guys who wrote this should be ashamed. (it might be like my review) They should of reread the things they wrote because most of it is so bad, even a 5 year old kid would of done something better. It was  really really bad. You have a bid deus ex machina. Characters that had no intoduction that just pop out of nowhere to save the situation. There is also a plot twist that completely ruins the movie by the end. 

The animation was also a big question for me. Sequences are action are just the caracters throwing their main signature attacks and that's all there is for the combat. No choregraphy, no movement except maybe for one scene. There is tho two characters who got some fire animation : Jimbei and Brook. But why them ???

And when you thought I was done talking about the flaws. There was a promess of Shanks being developed. And I'm sorry but Shanks is more developed in the trailer than in the actual movie. The only character in the movie that get's a tiny bit of developement is UTA and it's pretty bad. She transforms from a cliche girl that sings and is just nice, to a danganronpa character. She starts doing some wacky face and some weird poses it's random. Her developement is just really cliche. The writers clearly took no risk it was really a shame.

And I could go on and on with this movie. The 2/10 is more than justified. If I was a One Piece fan, I would be embarrased. ""New Gen"" Toei animation is really lazy and cares more about the money they can found in your pocket that in the work they can put out. I suggest you don't watch this movie, especially if you are not up to date on the latest scan because it does spoil some things for you. You can always watch this movie later. But even so, the writing is straight up bad and lazy and really the only thing you will find out of this movie is just a warmed up fan service from the One Piece ""saga""",False,anime_review,50410,2022-08-11T16:04:00+00:00
"Film Red is the second most idiosyncratic One Piece movie, thanks to its overt reliance on musical performances and the spotlight focused on Uta, a new female character. It also has the benefit of bringing out Shanks, who is one of the most important yet mysterious characters in the original work, as an active participant. While this is not a canonical story, I have found a lot to enjoy this time around and wish to share my thoughts and feelings with some open-minded readers. Of course, it is hard to ignore the commercial success of the movie's theatrical release, which proves Film Red has resonatedwith many thousands of people across Japan. However, I will warn those who are expecting more of the same that they may not always find it here. Thus I can at least respect, even in the midst of disagreement, those who felt this movie struck a discordant note. 

Why are there such vocal viewer reactions, alternatively expressing their love and hate for the end product? It's because Film Red brings together a relatively unique mix of rock opera, character drama and all-star battle through a couple of daring artistic choices. Thematically speaking, this movie also implicitly challenges a few of the assumptions that are common among a certain percentage of the One Piece fanbase. 

As you can easily imagine, that approach will not sit well with everyone. For me, Film Red doesn't seek to establish a new standard in terms of shonen battle spectacle, but it still reflects a key part of the emotional core of One Piece. There is plenty of merit in this. 

From a certain perspective, one of the great virtues of Eiichiro Oda's manga masterpiece has to do with the value of found family and the clash between different ideals of justice in a world that can simultaneously be incredibly colorful and whimsy while also continuing to be fundamentally unfair and occasionally outright cruel. Despite all of the twists and turns of this latest cinematic narrative, I would say the movie remains true to an interpretation of this idea.

STORY: 7.5/10

In many fictional stories, the most admirable heroes are those who simply fight against absolute evil and win. In the case of One Piece, there are plenty of those situations and our hero Luffy usually has his heart in the right place, but for me some of the best parts of the original story focus on the struggle of those characters who combine virtues with flaws and imperfections. Even if their motivations are ambiguous or even misguided, I have always been more interested in the little stories of characters who, whether important or not, at least try to stand up against the world to fight for what they believe in. Sometimes they win, sometimes they fail. 

Regardless of the merits or even the desirability of either side's beliefs, there can be a lot of poignancy in those moments. It doesn't matter if you're part of the Marines, Shichibukai or Yonko...your position doesn't necessarily mean all of your beliefs are right or wrong. Sure, we all know that One Piece is ultimately a Shonen Jump publication and this means there are certain ethical limits. I don't expect the grand tale of Luffy and his friends to end on an unhappy note, to be honest, but the story has occasionally reached towards exposing a darker underbelly than what its colorful surface suggests. In the long run, we trust those glimpses into a dark reality are only obstacles and a brighter future is waiting for our cast of characters. 

On the other hand,  there is also a degree of artistic value in the act of depicting what would happen in the One Piece world when the pressures are just too strong and you'd rather escape from reality...both for yourself and for the sake of others (or say, to meet the expectations and demands of others). In a way, that same sensation of tension and determination is part of what I can appreciate about Film Red's script. 

Predictably enough, it isn't simple to make One Piece: Film Red fit into any specific part of the larger One Piece story. 

You would quickly find small and large inconsistencies upon looking at the chronology. Yet, speaking only for myself, I was able to watch the movie as a standalone project with ease. When we are dealing with an alternate non-canonical storyline, as almost all One Piece movies are, the screenwriter can afford to play rather fast and loose with the absence and presence of various characters, abilities or locations.

Is it perfectly written? No. Does it need to be? Nope. While the formal narrative is arguably the weakest link in Film Red, it has also incorporated quite a few of the themes of One Piece while bringing a certain amount of fresh air into the room. I happen to find the features and consequences of that decision to be worth appreciating in multiple ways. 

In short, Eiichiro Oda himself supervised the creation of this movie and he was getting tired of creating ""legendary old men"". With a small number of honorable exceptions, most of the One Piece theatrical entries have fallen into a rather typical methodology: Luffy and the Straw Hats run into a new and seemingly all-powerful male foe, leading to a great battle where this enemy is inevitably defeated. Everyone can go home and be happy. The End.

That's all well and good, but at some point it's nice to add a little variety. Based on that premise, the story of Film Red is less of a straightforward pirate action adventure and more of a vehicle for the exploration of a new fictional character, Uta, through the use of musical expression. It would not be out of line to say that the term ""musical battle"" has been applied both literally and figuratively to this production with controversial yet arguably excellent results. 

Specifically, Uta, the idol and songstress who is the undeniable center of this movie, represents a concrete departure from the norm. 

Saying too much would be a spoiler, but the first half of Film Red is essentially built to introduce us to a set of mysteries. Mysteries with a degree of useful foreshadowing, as a matter of fact, although not everything will be immediately clear. To be sure, there are at least two big plot twists that aren't even remotely hinted at in the trailers. One of them is rather typical and can be found in plenty of other fictional works, yet it is still comparatively new within the context of the One Piece universe.

Unsurprisingly, resolving any mystery usually requires exposition. Around the midway point of the movie, the pace does tend to drag. This mystery-solving, so to speak, does provide a number of secondary characters with a chance to shine, but I agree it can feel rather heavy in the moment. That said, the musical sequences were able to revive my interest whenever it threatened to drop.

Now, strictly speaking, it would be incorrect to label Film Red as a complete musical. There's been some hyperbole about most of the movie being nothing other than songs in the old-school Disney fashion, which is objectively inaccurate. 

However, I can find a grain of truth in that statement. The viewers' ability to enjoy this project will rely, to a considerable extent, on their willingness to open their hearts and minds to what the movie is trying to do. Frankly, this is always more of an emotional process than a purely logical one. If that fails, then the entire house of cards will crumble and you'll leave the theater bored and bitter. Not my personal case, yet I can understand why other folks might reach such a conclusion. 

Once certain narrative keys have all been unlocked, Film Red's story pace speeds up during the second half and there is a large-scale battle waiting at the end. Yet this time, I would readily recognize that the outcome of the battle is the least interesting part. As spectacular as it is to see certain unexpected team-ups and so many powerful attacks being used...the real threat is not the external enemy, but an internal one. It is there that the Film Red script will play its final card and, for my money, the gamble was worth my investment. Naturally, this will vary depending on the viewer's own preference, tastes and capacity for empathy.

To put things in perspective here...any truly action-based movie like the mega-hit One Piece: Stampede would place far more attention on the battle choreography aspect. Yet Stampede, for all of its adrenaline, felt comparatively emotionally shallow. I dare to say that One Piece: Film Red is almost the exact opposite. For me, the relatively underwhelming combat was compensated by more of a theatrical and engaging approach to the drama. 

CHARACTERS: 8/10

Oh boy. I'll only discuss a limited number of individuals in detail, because there's a large cast involved here and it would take too long. Ironically enough...they're a lot, but not near the level of Stampede's famously enormous list of participating pirates. 

That said, I found even the secondary or tertiary characters to have a more convincing in-universe reason to show up. You still need a certain amount of key One Piece figures to really sell the scale of the threat. Quite a few get their own small moment too. 

Is that fanservice? Sure, but celebrating existing characters is fine. When it serves a valid narrative objective it actually doesn't bother me. In a perfect world, I'd have liked to see the Straw Hats taking on a more formal leading role, yet one of the unique freedoms provided by the concept of a non-canonical One Piece movie is that the staff can afford to experiment. In other words, the camera can temporarily move away from them a little bit to serve other purposes. They'll continue getting more than enough development and a strong public profile in the main story, so there's no overwhelming urgency to feature them at this point.

Having said that, let's talk about the more central players. 

Without being the deepest psychological examination ever, I think the storytelling's focus on the new character of Uta adds up to a fairly complex and potentially appealing characterization. From a bird's eye view, you could even draw a couple of contrasts with Nami's and Robin's arcs from way back in the day. All of which is part of why I'll honestly give Film Red a good amount of credit here.  

Uta's motivations are tricky, because there's technically three of them, depending on what part of the movie you want to consider and how you interpret the meaning of these events. In this regard, her status as the daughter (!?) of Shanks provides a common starting point of understanding. Uta's background allows us to compare her with Luffy and his own aspirations. In practice, this achieves the goal of successfully introducing her to the existing One Piece world. The flashbacks are quite helpful as a method of humanization in this respect. Which is vital, given the twisted path the movie takes. 

In a few words, there really isn't any other music-related character in One Piece with quite the same combination of positive and negative traits, especially not in the movies. She can go from genuinely funny and friendly to courageous, selfless, selfish, frustrating, annoying, pitiful, desperate and, yes, endearing. As a result, we can almost track Uta's emotional journey as communicated through the different songs. That's quite a novel approach for a One Piece project and, in and of itself, already makes her stand out. Furthermore, I recommend paying a bit of attention to her facial expressions.

I am not entirely surprised that people will either find a lot to love or a lot to hate in her, because both evaluations can be objectively supported. If we asked ten different people, we would get a significant split in terms of their judgments of Uta. Similarly, my own range of emotions towards her went through a lot of highs and lows...until the end, which left quite a lasting impression. With that in mind, I believe the creators of the film made the right decision to focus on Uta. Rather ambitious and even risky as an artistic decision, yes, but you'll never win big if you only ever dare to make entirely safe bets. 

The other new individual of note is Gordon. Even though his screen presence in Film Red is significantly less than Uta's and his looks aren't anything special, I think Gordon was a surprisingly good fit for this story. While it's easy to dismiss him, especially without going into spoilers, there's a reason why ageless wisdom teaches us to avoid judging a person by his or her external appearance. 

Next, there's the significant matter of Luffy. He is still Oda's eternal protagonist for the larger story of One Piece, by all rights and with all the benefits this position brings, but in this particular movie it's going to be a little different from the usual. 

Luffy's still going to participate in battles and remains our nominal entry point into the situation. Yet, for once, his normal level of importance was held back by the nature of a standalone narrative focused on, gasp, someone else. Imagine that.  

All the same, he still serves an interesting role in Film Red. In a sense, it's another way of putting him to the test compared to the usual type of enemies he has had to deal with. 

You can also ask a number of questions as a result, not necessarily in the strict canonical sense but as general themes. What is Luffy's exact relationship to Uta? Does Luffy share her beliefs or does he maintain his own way of thinking? Can Luffy really solve every problem? What does Uta's story imply about Luffy's? 

While it would require spoilers to address those points here, for me Luffy's role was still more of a positive than a negative.

Now I've finally come to discuss Shanks, who is the obvious elephant in the room. 

Most viewers will be incredibly glad to see Shanks in Film Red. In fact, Shanks gets to do a lot more during this one movie than you might expect. More than what he's done in years, regardless of whether or not you're up to date with the manga. This inclusion might be debatable, because some other One Piece fans would prefer to keep Shanks strictly away from the spotlight until the original creator gives us all the details about him in a completely canonical work. 

I can respect this way of thinking, despite not sharing it. Sure, there is also going to be some skepticism in light of the commercial nature of anime production. After all, Shanks was part of the promotional materials for the movie, but he isn't the protagonist. If you haven't paid any attention to the trailers, which make clear he isn't supposed to be the one central figure in this new story, that might be disappointing.

And yet, I would argue using Shanks in Film Red was a valid creative choice for two reasons. 

First, because it's naturally cool to see Shanks as an active player in the action after so long. Why shouldn't we be hyped about that? They even found a creative solution to the ""impossible problem"" posed by Shanks being in a movie featuring Luffy. 

Second, perhaps more importantly, because the movie does serve to tell us more about him. Both directly and indirectly. 

There's his relationship with Uta, which has value in and of itself by developing Shanks as a father figure as well as by providing us with a curious method to reflect about the meaning of his relationship with Luffy. The way he reacts (or doesn't) to the events of this movie can show us more about his personality. 

While almost the totality of the movie can never happen in the original storyline, I am confident that Oda made sure to supervise how Shanks would be depicted to guarantee he would be fully in-character here. Plus, as a bonus, we also get a couple of pieces of extra information about the past of Shanks that can  add fuel to the fan theories about what's really going to happen with him.

ART AND ANIMATION: 8/10

Film Red was a very nice looking movie, for the most part. In particular, the musical performance scenes are a visual highlight for anyone who cares about this medium. Outside of the minor use of 3D with mixed results, I was pleased by the presentation, including quite a few nice storyboards. Great job!

Let's get this out of the way: yes, you can still find a number of less relevant sequences with pre-Wano arc levels of animation, particularly during a bunch of regular conversation scenes. It doesn't bother me, but I can see why those moments could take a few of the viewers out of the experience if they're used to the best parts of the TV series in terms of animation.

When the animators  put their skills and resources at work, however, Film Red can be a feast for the eyes. 

SOUND: 10/10

Perfect. No, seriously. 

If you're going to make a movie where the use of music plays a central role in the storyline and one of the main characters is a singer, then the songs should be excellent. Otherwise, what would be the point of such an enterprise?

I'm glad to report that Film Red's creative staff made an impressive decision when they selected Ado to provide Uta's seven songs. She's great. Ado's collaborations with many famous artists cover a wide spectrum of emotional expression and musical genres, which bring a welcome variety to the sound of the movie and also feeds into Uta's characterization by reflecting her mental and emotional state. 

They're used very well. I would say my favorites are ""Backlight"", ""New Genesis"", ""Tot Musica"" and ""Where The Wind Blows"". 

Significantly, even the lyrics gain a different layer when you sit down to listen to them after watching the movie. 

ENJOYMENT: 9/10

I like One Piece. Not as the most hardcore of fans, but enough of one to appreciate Oda's skillful storytelling and follow along with the storyline at my own pace. 

At the same time, I think it's good to have movies where different aspects of the world of One Piece can be explored, even outside of strict canon. I welcome creators who try to do something new, even if it means taking a risk and not pleasing all of the audience.

The real goal of these movies isn't to satisfy every single person, which is almost impossible in this age, but to add new blood to the property and, at least in a manner of speaking, provide a path for new people to come in (and to make money, yes, but that is already evident to anyone reading this). 

For me, Film Red has achieved the majority of what was required in this respect. As a work of entertainment, you don't necessarily need to be an expert on One Piece to appreciate this movie. In fact, I have heard of former One Piece fans in Japan who came back to see this film and had a good time. If at least some of them decide to pick up the manga or the anime, then this represents a net gain to the community. 

Even so, there are specific things that will be more appealing to existing fans, especially those who are less interested in the result of a battle than in the emotional fallout. As mentioned elsewhere, this is less of a rollercoaster of action than a rollercoaster of emotions. If you are strictly logical and not particularly romantic (in the classic sense of the term, mind you), then Film Red may disappoint you. 

In my personal case, I would like to invite anyone who found anything of interest in this review to give the movie a chance. 

OVERALL: 8.5/10",False,anime_review,50410,2022-08-12T20:31:00+00:00
"See? This is the evidence of why Divas/Idols element would never work inside this medium. Please, please! stop creating a character with their sole characterization is only ""Good At Singing"". A character development contained solely on a progress of: ""from a good singer, to a great singer, to a world famous singer solving a world wide problem with a song"" it's so fricking lame! cringe! and lazy! It's doesn't work on Black Clover with their mermaid diva. It doesn't work on Belle. The most boring part of Vivy and Kongmin is the singing part. And the only things that make Zombieland Saga became atleast a bearableidol anime, is because it's a fricking parody!

Can you guess why? why is this formula became one of my most hated tropes in all anime? Because idols or divas in real life, are relaying so much on the ""fame factors"" that they've had from the established fanbases. So, creating a fictional character or group based around this premises meaning that you're also have to create, fabricates and establish that fame factors from a fictional fanbases to make that character alive. And a fabricated fame, just like a sign on the audience seat that says ""cheers"", would always be counted as a plot armor!. Not to mention that the taste on music are varies on everybody, that'd just make the narrative became more and more unaccessible.

Uta is the embodiment of plot conveniences. And for some people that says Uta is the condensation of every themes in One Piece, yeah, no wonder it feels shit. They're trying too hard for basically making a speedrun of creating a likeable character by expositioning everything. So yeah sure, for some who doesn't understand what exposition means, she would appears soo deep. I mean, the only themes that i found aligned with Uta from the canon-piece, is the child abandonment.

Why Oda? Why would you tarnish your reputation like this? From Stampede to this, it's a lazy work to create a scenario with its sole objectives just to incorporates as many cameos as you like. No! more character does not mean more fun! The more crowded it is, the more lazy work has to be done! Are you happy that all of your characters are reduced to be just a hollow animated figures with an attack name and catchphrases?: The Straw Hat Pirates turned from a lovable protagonist into a squad of Power Rangers, shouting their secrets moves. Shanks crew turned from a mysterious figures into a boring deus ex-machina, solving all the problems with a biblical power. The Admirals and the Navy's are turned from a terrifying forces into a party tricks, just to enliven the ensemble. I mean what else could i say? Great job! *clap**clap*

Seems like it would be a long way for me until i see the next movie Z.

And oh yeah, for the positives,... atleast most of the songs are banger! Would surely jamming to the soundtrack when it's released",False,anime_review,50410,2022-09-14T07:21:00+00:00
"Okay, listen up! For all those who are bored to read a long review just know this: ""I found a lot of subjective flaws in this movie and I don't recommend it. Heck, as a fan of the franchise for more than 20 years I even found it insulting."" For all the others fellow OP fans, keep reading... Firstly let us look at the summary of this movie. Cruela de Vil's daughter, dyes the black part of her hair red (because of her daddy issues with Shanks), becomes a famous singer a la Katy Perry, gets high on cute addictive mushrooms on stage and creates her owncolorful Matrix so she can sing endlessly to her zombie fans and consequently wipe out piracy. Her sasaeng fans (this time in the form of the Straw Hats) were not very happy with that as they have other idols' concerts to attend to, thus decide to ruin all her fun.The end.
What you've just read is a summary to a very mediocre fanfiction story I would glimpse on a lazy Sunday. Unfortunately, for all of us, somebody from the OP team, also read this idiotic plot and decided that it would be a great idea to make an OP movie out of it.

Well, here is my own short plot if I would have any say in creating an OP movie called Red:
Shanks, the captain of the infamous Red Hair pirate crew ventures to seize a mythological artifact known for being able to cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. Little did they know though that this artifact demands a great sacrifice in return for its gifts, thus leaving the Red Hair pirates decimated. As the world gets restless at the sudden loss of one of the most powerful crews, Shanks, asks for help from the only pirate crew he trusts: The Straw Hats.
Together, they strive to unravel the mystery of the artifact, save his crew from its guardians and bring back balance to the world.

And now be honest, which one of the aforementioned plots would you rather watch and think better suits One Piece and a movie called RED???!!!

Okay, back to being serious now. What is trending for the last two years in Japan? Ado, the singer behind Uta's songs. What is trending in Japan since 1997? One Piece manga/anime. Let's make a musical combination of those two. Eeeeh... wrong! You could have done that if your anime was Cardcaptor Sakura or Little Witch Academia. But, in relation to the two aforementioned shojo anime, One Piece's grand franchise is the only beacon attracting such a massive audience to watch Red. A pirate themed anime that has more that 70% male audience is not supposed to be this girly and wishy-washy. This whole thing screamed that the marketing team of OP just wanted to attract more females to the franchise or in plain English, the huge fan base of Ado. The only thing I can give kudos for to the marketing team is that they had the audacity and ruse to name the movie Red and make it look like we would see more of Shanks' involvement.

Don't get me wrong, I liked Ado. I googled a couple of her songs after this movie and her voice was enjoyable. Nevertheless, a movie in this franchise can’t be carried only by it’s soundtrack. I would have been more satisfied if the songs focused more of their lyrics on the world of OP instead of being another pop cliche single ready to be sold after the release of the movie.

My experience with this movie has been quiet straightforward. After watching Gold and Stampede my expectations were low to say the least. Red was an overall mess with no structure that's almost impossible to follow as the previous two movies. It keeps most of it's focus on Uta (Heck, she even has more lines and screen time than Luffy!), but everyone else feels like jam-packed in and there for the sake of it. Even Marvel's Infinity War had a lot of characters but they all had a purpose. As for the battles... hahaha! What battles? They seem like cut scenes from a video game. Especially if you see that the final battle is a full-on clusterfuck against something that wasn't even supposed to be in a pirate themed anime. How much weirder this franchise is going to be? The only things that made me give this movie a 3 were a couple of songs, Usopp's link with ****** at the end and Uta's devil fruit (which was a fantastic power but unfortunately very badly used).

I understand One Piece is huge and there's so many great characters outside of the Straw Hats, however I think future movie entries could stand to tell more intimate, shorter stories going on instead of being two &amp; a half hour, poorly made money grabbers. Even Marvel learned their lesson and stated: ""We will be focusing more on quality over quantity.""",False,anime_review,50410,2022-12-07T07:51:00+00:00
"Might be a bit of spoilers in this review, fair warning: One Piece has become such a staple to current day fans to where once people heard a movie was coming, everyone was ecstatic. This was also a movie I have been longing for as a Shanks fan, but I will try to be thorough and keep the information involving this review concise. Story: The story was fairly simple but I would have preferred if the movie did not promo Shanks as the headliner rather than Uta since it mostly surrounds her entire story. She is portrayed as Luffy's brother and the daughter of Shanks, which sheis then left alone due to a certain incident, thus trying to protect her for the justification. The story also feels very different in regards to how One Piece typically does their story especially for movies. This movie feels most similar to Strong World if I had to compare it to any of them.

This movie tried something different, just like how Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero had done and I think it depends on the person on who watches this movie when it comes down to how they feel about the story or if they felt misled.

Animation: Regarding the animation, just like current One Piece they just pop off from the dancing of Uta to just the fight animation. The animation that will stick out to people the most is the last bit of the fight and I think it is very fair to compare it to the level of hype that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero final scene with how much justice was given for those who are aware. I personally believe in regards to animation, nobody will be disappointed and have any complaints on.

Soundtrack: The soundtrack here gets very iffy because I would like to mention one of my cons here as well. The singer does a FANTASTIC job with singing, beautiful voice and very befitting to what Uta portrays. The issue here becomes how much it was used throughout the movie. You could classify this movie as a musical and I would have believed it with how many times songs are played within this movie. If you're thinking this is a typical One Piece movie and this becomes your first watched One Piece movie, I strongly advise to not walk into the movie thinking that and to start with something else.

Character: When it comes down to the characters, I personally believe there was too much potential left out such as Uta and even Shanks in all honesty. Uta was the main character of the movie, yet nothing really hit home when it came down to her. Uta was very enjoyable and I did find her refreshing but much more character could have been brought out within the time period of the movie. In regards to Shanks, I believe those who are OG Shanks fans will fall in love with him even more because I personally felt that myself. There is not much to say in regards to him, just him being how he was from the get go should speak enough words as is.

CONS: First con I already mentioned, which would be the whole musical performance spam within the movie. It felt out of place and super unnecessary which wasted a good chunk of time for the movie. Another issue being an influx of filler characters which I will not name, however,  I do feel that the characters that were used in this movie had such little time and was only there for usage of fanservice. I think this con only really could relate to some people, but I personally felt misled when I first saw that Shanks was having a movie based on him but it involved him only so little and was rather based on his daughter.

Overall/Enjoyment: I love One Piece and I certainly do love this movie regardless of the minimal flaws and all. The enjoyment I had for the movie and rating in general is certainly bias, but I would like to think I gave good information involving the movie. I personally believe the enjoyment of the movie comes down to what you look for in a movie regarding One Piece specifically and also what you were looking forward to. If you were just wanting to watch the movie due to animation and characters like most fans, this movie will not disappoint at all. In regards to if you were looking for story, I think this may lead to some disappoint due to the spamming of musicals within the movie.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-08-11T17:27:00+00:00
"I do not understand how this movie has such a high score. Is it from all the One Piece fans that have yet to see it and just assume it is going to be great, so they give it a 10? Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge One Piece fan, but this movie is the worst One Piece film out of the bunch, taking into account when they were each released. You can feel the force of the movie, from the beginning, trying to rush you through. It felt so choppy and there were instances, that I will not spoil, that simply did not makesense for what was going on at the moment. There wasn't a single remarkable fight scene. The animation was subpar in comparison to past OP films. Honestly, it was a cluster f* that only had decent music, which in itself didn't mesh 100% of the time. Like, how are you gonna have a flashback of a child singing [multiple times], but have a clearly adult voice? It was disruptive in itself, causing you to lose any momentum the film may have gained. Could the producers not find a Japanese child with a decent singing voice?

"I never thougt I do a review on it. But here I am. I was a privileged one to saw a preview on august 6 (for once, us europeans, we have the chance to have something before the ""worldwide""). It was really great to saw it on a big screen, yes, visually it was fantastic. The all thing was like to be on a rock show, really, the sound design/the music/voice acting, it was rad. Keep in mind that the movie is bascially a musical comedy, so you have a bunch of song, but it fits with the story. The protagonist you're gonna follow (outside of luffy andthe mugiwara obviously) is Uta, à girl who only wants to make the world a better place by her songs without war (pirates, marines and other shenanigans). So the only character who's gonna sing, is the singer herself. Don't worry, you're not gonna have ""I'aM gOnNa Be ThE kInG oF pIrAtE YEAAAAAAAH !!"".

So yes, the movie follow the story of Uta, who's presuambly Shanks's daughter (like you have probably saw on the multiples trailers or teasings). She have been left alone on a country where she gonna rode to be a star.

I think the thing I love the most to the movie it's what it tells. For the first time in One Piece (in that way and to be the big plot at least), it shows you the bad part of the pirates, peoples dying/stealing poor peoples/rumbling of entire isle, I think it's very interesting. And the idea to left the world, to live in a dream to leave the horrible world or the music allowing to be free, it simply big ass philosophy and I love it.

It something new in world of One Piece. You have to see it by yourself.

"So FIRST: This movie is a weird hybrid, more like a shounenish MUSICAL rather than a previously expected 100% shounen movie. AND SECOND: I think the storyline of the movie and the attitude of Toei utterly do not contribute to this vivid world. THIRD: Movie titled RED but Shanks is not a main character of the movie, he has a longer cameo, but that is ALL! Prologue: Before I start the real review, I have to say something about One Piece, and about my connection to One Piece. For my One Piece the anime for a long time, even though I do not tend to like mainstream shounen,somewhy me, as an adult close to 30 this whole complex world simply enraptured Arc by Arc. I had hard times with One Piece when I started more than 10 years ago, and probably not the best show ever, and not the show that contributed to most of my adulthood, still think One Piece itself is a miracle and am proud to be a part of it and I am 100% will be a One Piece fan until the end of the series.

Storyline: 

The storyline of the movie is about Uta, a great singer who is a viral Den-Den Mushinternet star, and recently undertook her first IRL concert, on the Island of Music, so-called ELEGIA. First, it looks like a concert, but it reveals a lot of pirates who want to kidnap Uta, probably for bribe money, but none of them - even the SuperStrong Big-Mom Pirates-  is able to do it. Soon, Uta reveals her plan, which she calls ""New Genesis"" which is a peaceful Dreamworld where everyone is equal, which means mostly dead. Also, a new ""antagonist"" is mysteriously revealed the TOT MUSICA. The WG, Akainu, Gorosei, Pirate crews and soon everybody wants to stop UTA.

I MUST mention this movie can not be inserted anywhere in the storyline. So for me, it is 100% COMPLETE FILLER, even though Uta was mentioned in the Manga once. Was a bit confusing because, for example, if you are up to date on the manga, you must know, this movie contained a lot of characters that obviously CAN NOT appear after Wano, but like Sanji or Luffy late on in the movie used a skill that is from or after WANO. 

REVIEW:

I think in these kinds of criticism far easier to highlight the problematic things, and because of it, the CONs part could be longer than the PRO part. For this reason, I start with the GOOD part. As I mentioned before, It was not a standard shounen movie. I love One Piece's uniqueness, and this movie has a good one in the style, which was pretty interesting. So, basically, even though it has an all-variety of shounen demographic styles (like fights, skills, etc), still this movie was closer to a musical in the genre. We heard at least 10 songs during these 100 minutes, and the songs were pretty cool. And surprise, the audio part was simply DOPE, outstandingly GOOD. The kashuu (Singer) did a great job with Uta's songs, which was unquestionably the BEST part of the movie. And because the songs were connected to Uta's skills, a lot of fights were like a well-choreographed AMV video mashup. 

So in one world, the style of this movie was unique. However, this uniqueness probably does not for everyone. Some people could call it weird as I did, and I know it could be a double-edged sword so maybe there could be a layer that does not like this musical/shounen style. 

Also, the second PRO for me is the last fight. Yep, it was not too long. Yep, the animation in the whole movie was so-so. But MY GOD, the last fight was really interesting... even though the fact story did not but it is too early. So it was a World of Warcraft RAID boss fight, with 3 factions in two timelines, but instead of the TANK HEAL DAMAGE holy trinity, we got Fighters, Guardians, Gatekeepers, Realm-Projectors (Usopp/Yasopp;Katakuri/Brulee). For me it was phenomenal. Short but readable. 

Yet, I have to turn to the CONs soon, and this is a good start. Since the Movie was maybe entitled partly to Shanks, but he does not fight. We saw him and his whole crew but did not show any specific skills. The most mentionable move of him was to slice and dice with his -OBVIOUSLY- One-Handed sword against Kizaru and the final boss. I expected far more, especially after the buildup of Uta's character which showed a lot of relations with Shanks and the Akagami no Kaizokudan. But probably it was an acceptable choice to not show Shanks's skills since we still do not know too much about him. 

But the movie showed something else about Shanks, and hell yeah, I would be MAD really MAAAADDDD if it would be the part of Original storyline. They showed some fractions of Shanks's childhood, like only glimpses of the past but without any sense. It was only good to make some more questions about Shanks's anyway too much mystery character. And this is because I said One Piece would lose its uniqueness if this movie would be part of the Story. And not this is the only example of this. 

The whole Uta story was like something they forgot, something important. Hard to formulate what is it, but a lot of happenings in the movie were clearly artificial. And even though, the One Piece world is kinda artificial BUT IN A GOOD WAY, this movie was the same artificial but in a BAD way. The island of Elegia ITSELF was artificial in a bad way. It has no purpose besides the movie. I love the One Piece world, so, a Music Island, WHY NOT? There are a lot of characters that are connected to the Music, like Apoo, Brook, etc... BUT without any place in the actual One Piece world, it is just simply self-serving. Even cameo characters (Blueno for example), the overused jokes (with BEPOO), and the unjustified cute characters were also self-serving here. It felt like and outcast, if we take the original storyline.

And this is true not only for Uta, but for the whole island of Elegia, and everything itself. Elegia's past does not affect the world. We did not know anything about the chaos in the past of this island before. One Piece has several trillion mysterious or interesting things but they came up with a new ""oh GOD we never heard about this"" enemy, the TOT MUSICA and demon-god. Truly, I am speechless about this. 

And the worse of the worst is connected to this. Uta's plan was ridiculous, even though it was anticipated by the whole World Government, Uta easily outwitted 70% of the world (Including Yonkou crew, Gorosei, Admirals, Government, Celestial Dragons, Cypher Pol agents) with some singing and a bunch of magic-mushrooms. In one sentence, I LOVE TO THINK about One Piece's complexity, and why that is why I think this whole story of this movie is simply below mediocre.

I saw the movie twice. Once in a cinema in 4DX for the experience, but after the second I find the worst part, which is this movie thinks the whole One Piece world is like 1-bit shounen bullshit, and that should be a trigger point for any One Piece fans. I love One Piece because of its complexity, in One Piece every single small act has at least a previous reason. Because of this, I DO NOT ACCEPT that a depressive singer outwitted this complex world with a stupid 4/10 plan.

If you could abstract from the real storyline, this movie could be a nice experience with a unique musical-shounen style, with a lot of funny scenes and some interesting cameos then, I would recommend it. In this case, it is a 7/10 movie.

But if we take the OG One Piece complexity and the world-class world, this movie is 5 out of 10 in the best scenario, and 3 out of that 5 are the songs.",False,anime_review,50410,2023-01-29T08:02:00+00:00
"Mostly Spoiler Free. This movie was not made for me, since I do not have TikTok. A lot of the focus of this movie is on Music and dance choreography, and I just do not care. If you are like me and find those Dances a bit cringy, some sequences of this movie are hard to get through. First, let's talk about the good things. The movie was mostly animated on a good to very good level. Little sakuga like we got with the finale of Wano and some CGI Models that stuck out a bit, but the finale was beautful and many art decisions, like thenew character outfits, were really good. It is definetly a visually pleasing movie.

Sadly, the same cannot be said about the story. Overall, it is pretty simple: This Idol Uta uses music to cast Eternal Tsukuyomi. 

This is an oversimplification, there is a reason for her actions, but the story is anything but deep. In fact, it often feels like you look at the backbone of a story that could have been a good but basic story for a one piece movie if developed beyond the first few drafts. It really feels like the writers didn't care a lot. Instead, the focus was on giving every single important character a cameo, just to get some hype from the fanbase, which began to feel jarring, especially regarding the relationship between characters that felt wrong. 

This need to cram in as much as possible made the pacing way too fast, which is wierd to say as a One Piece fan. Everything was so fast and the good moments were soon met with something stupid and I was barely able to build up any sympathy for the character of Uta before she was revealed to be fucking crazy and basically Obito. 

This basically the moment I also realised, what I was watching. This movie was not ment to be watched. This movie is way too fast for that. It's also not cohesive, it avoids storytelling thoughout the movie at most points. This movie is made to be consumed in the form of 30 second clips on TikTok, Reels or Shorts. Not at a homescreen or a theatre, on the phone while you are scrolling. Just take a short, senseless fight from the movie, add one of the multiple original songs from Uta in the Background and have someone do the fitting choreography thats also in the movie in front of it, that was the vision when this movie was made. Once I came to that realisation, it all made sense, but I lost all interest left in me. I actually had to take 3 attempts to get through it because I began to fall asleep all the time.

"I think this is my favorite One Piece movie so far. It had a stronger narrative than some of the others and I really liked how they tied the past into the present (of the story in 2022 at least). I really liked how they created a reason to have so many fan favorites together. I also like how they explored how devil's fruits can be very dark when influenced by negative forces. That said, it still had a lot of the other movies' weaknesses. The narrative was a little convoluted in places but cleaner than other movies. There came a point in which itfelt like maybe things were dragging a little here and there but it would immediately pick back up again. Overall, it was a fun time and seems rewatchable. 

If you liked previous One Piece movies then you'll likely enjoy this one. If you're the type of person who doesn't like things that might remind you a little of Alice in Wonderland, then you might not enjoy it so much. I'm definitely looking forward to the inevitable next movie.",False,anime_review,50410,2024-04-05T13:19:00+00:00
"I will be very clear about why I gave this film a low rating and why it is horrible: UTA IS A TERRIBLE CHARACTER!! What's more, are they playing with us? Did they create so much hype around Shanks' appearance for the damn thing to appear in very few frames? Honestly, horrible, I found the story really boring too, Uta is a spoiled girl who can't get over her traumas and wants everyone to get involved in it. I swear, when they put that scene showing that Uta was part of Luffy's childhood, I wanted to leave the movie theater. I've seen One Piece movies thatdidn't really captivate me, but this one gave me a feeling that I hate: disgust.",False,anime_review,50410,2024-01-19T10:05:00+00:00
"This was definitely the most “meh” One Piece movie in a while. As much as it hurts me to say, I refrained from reviewing the movie for as long as I've been trying to justify exciting it more than it deserved, because, well, it's One Piece. Much like most One Piece fans, I was hyped to the max for this movie, as most of us call it, “Shanks's move”. It was something it felt like 2 decades coming, but never too late, we finally get to know more about this fan-favorite character, until we didn't... Well, kinda. No spoilers in check, the info we deluded ourselves wewere gonna get was nowhere in sight, II don't get why they decided to include it in the booklet given for free for people who watched the movie in Japan, the movie had a lot of screentime to cram the info in, heck, the Manga could have taken a couple of chapters to the whole thing. We took the hit on this one.

Reality has it, this was a mediocre One Piece movie with a few hype moments, and a fantastic musical fiasco that did not slow down on creativity. The key here is to know what to expect, II have never heard about Ado before this movie, and I assure you it will not be the case after it, I mean, for someone with the same name as Oda sensei, only in reverse (Oda =&gt; Ado), destiny did quite a play on us. I loved every single song featured in the movie, and the visual choreography was no idle either, really, a masterful presentation for what felt like a lifetime music festival that just happened to be taking place in the world of One Piece.

The animation felt right at home, nothing too crazy, thanks to Toei's amazing work lately on the anime, the movie mentions the same Wano arc with all the swirly washed-up strokes, and of course, some average CGI blending that could have been omitted in my opinion.

The plot itself was nothing spectacular, again, much like Stampede, the whole setup felt like a fan service showcase that revolves around the Red-Haired Pirates.

"Uta is inseparable when talking about Film Red. This is one of those cases, I believe, where viewer reception to a story is contingent upon their attachment to a character. A One Piece musical starred by a young diva of relevant relations with Luffy and Shanks, with utter focus on her character journey as she descends towards the depths of an antagonist's despairing motives. The first four words already spells ""novel"" in capitals, and it keeps on getting unconventional. And that's just the synopsis alone. The experience is entirely something else, something that I never expected out of any One Piece story, canon or not.To put it out of the way, One Piece Film Red was a delectable taste of a grand recipe revamp that shines through with a positive aftertaste despite executionary shortcomings on the narrative and animation and a not-so-full-proof Devil Fruit mechanics.

And yes, I have no major problems with Uta herself.

The movie partitions our lead's character journey through seven Uta no Uta (Uta songs) plus some essential flashbacks. It feels proper to judge the effectiveness of a musical through its creative presentation of the starring actor by means of songs suitable to piece together the fragments that make up the theme and message.

~New Genesis~
New Genesis introduces Uta's motivations for building a brighter future by escaping through the portal of music where dreamland resides. It serves as the bedrock in explaining her dreams. The upbeat nature of the music echoing through the whole setting masks her methodology's characteristics, which makes the way Uta's performance all the way through these opening sequences is airtight aid the twist's catharsis and telling of her personality filled with genuine empathy, albeit misguided. New Genesis perfectly paves the way for the rest of the story along the path it aims to tread.

~I'm Invincible~
Here Uta shows off her fearsome abilities by effortlessly fending off powerful foes while performing a happy pop song. In a way it takes a laughter and a few from me seeing how breezy that feat was for her to achieve. It was around this portion that the tone starts to show hints of shifting. Film Red does a good job in playing with the atmosphere in the right notes and beat as it effectively drew me in to the narrative.

~Backlight~
Spawns of fury light the stage with a burning number coming from Uta. Even against the Straw Hats her fearsome control over her overpowered Devil Fruit took her to a landslide victory. We receive a glimpse of her rage and her conviction that it is ultimately ""for love"". Such a powerful performance that reveals her stance on the story and confronts Luffy's ideals with opposition. The gremlin-like effects and voice style on some lines additionally adds a degree of mockery, screaming an unleashing of bottled emotions. Miles away indeed from the upbeat nature of the first two idol songs.

~Fleeting Lullaby~
Uta maintains the pixie tone in singing her lullaby which elucidates her wish for a new world by taking up the responsibility and justifying her actions through the promise of paradise in the dreamworld. Moreover, we know now that she is experiencing a deep sense of loneliness and therefore increasing self-certitude to carry out her plans due to a longing for everlasting connection with everyone, especially her fans; escapism through dreams, taking the whole world to slumber with a fleeting lullaby while remaining as the sole person awake until her body breaks and everyone unites through death. What makes this ironic is Uta actually being the one closing her eyes to reality.

The way we learn more about Uta through songs that lean on madness and insanity despite her flashbacks and her promising ideals amplifies the tragedy. And it's just badass that this song choreographs Uta as the puppeteer giving the navy a run for their money.

~Tot Musica~
""Tot Musica"" is the climax we all needed. It showcases what lies at the precipice of Uta's mind when cornered by contrarians stranger and familiar and the taxing side-effects of the wake-shroom. A grand culmination of suffering with epic music blaring on the background which captures the distorted notes of Uta's holistic state. It speaks for itself, a legitimate yell for a brighter future clouded by desperation and tunnel vision which manifests as the essence of the apocalypse. When the only way you could believe life can be happy is away from reality, spelling out death by implication, even resorting to using the very cause of your trauma to hopefully turn it all around, then it's one hell of a situation. Cataclysmic stakes led by a colorful character such as Uta paints tragedy in more profound layers, and I love how Film Red handled the plot like that.

~The World's Continuation~
The world's continuation, where we can find the fulfillment of dreams in reality. Uta gazes back to the simple things in her life which shape a castle of meaning and answers and how it clicked on her that there can be positivity lying ahead, and that everyone should brave themselves to confront it. It's a highly appropriate song in reclaiming the consciousness of her victims from the Uta World to the real world. Thus the music sheet filled with devastating noises closes and the wind blows open the sound of a hopeful future.

~Where the Wind Blows~
The film calls back the first song we saw Uta sung back when she was still a child as the closer as she breaths her last in the arms of her father. It evoked high emotional resonance to me as it augments Uta's genuine wish to be the one sparking change in an era fraught with conflict and loss. ""Where the Wind Blows"" echoes a commonplace message which desires to revitalize the hopeless, remind the strayed, and embrace the lonely.

Every individual song performance provides an avenue to explore Uta's character in a more creative and engaging way. Not only that, it speaks to the story's setting which takes place in the Great Pirate Era drowning the voice of light in an age of heated differences clashing together everyday. Film Red's Uta expresses a fervent wish for world peace, an ideal world. I guess something like this can fit well in the political One Piece world and is expected to come one way or another. That answers its relevance as an entry in the series.

Beside the songs is the sense of urgency due to the pivotal ground Uta stands on in connection to Luffy and Shanks. We are used to Luffy's crew saving someone important every arc, but when this someone who needs saving is his childhood friend AND Shanks's daughter AND turns out to be the villain, now that twisted shade swells in devastating melancholy. It ultimately lies on Uta's credibility to be the antagonist, which through the songs and the flashbacks solidify it properly, allowing the drama to become as full-blown as it can be with success. 

One Piece Film Red is not without flaws of course. The novelty is not a problem per se, but in many occasions the execution was jarring in the musical performances. It's just hard to make everything work perfectly in incorporating sung songs in the middle of a battle. Knowing that it's One Piece, the exotic approach distances satisfied reactions further. I think it worked out well for the most part though. Something to be reflected upon, however, is how there are plenty more eye candy battle scenes with fluid animation rather than the act of singing and dancing in anime. The latter usually lacks substance or is presented awkwardly. Also, they should have casted someone else that fits kid Uta's voice to sing Where the Wind Blows and not Ado navigating all ways to make it suitable (it didn't sound so good to me).

Overall, I enjoyed Film Red because I enjoyed Uta as the heart of the story. I restrained myself making this an Uta analysis and neglecting the film as an entity along with its other factors, so I hope it all ended well in that regard. It's what I was most difficult for me, seeing as how interconnected the character is to the movie itself. Bridging to other related topics was an ordeal. Anyways, good movie!

"The first 80% of the movie is really bad imo. Very childish and many ""musical""-like scenes, overall very cringe and not enjoyable for me. (My friends got dub ticket's on accident which made it even worse lol) Many plot essentials like Uta's motives aren't really made clear. Shanks action isn't enough, imo calling the Film ""Red"" is just a marketing scheme. Then once the final battle starts I find that the music fits much better and you get the usual one piece hyped feeling. And if you don't want to be spoilered in the movie, you should either have read the manga or wait till the finalbattle in Wano is over.

I am not sure about the target audience of this movie, for some kids the age under 14 who have watched all of one piece the movie will probably be way more enjoyable then it was for me. I think many One Piece fans are 20 and over, and for those that I know it was a cringefest.

To be fair the animation was solid, although not on the level of the demonslayer movie. I didn't enjoy the silly backgrounds in the final fight.

Most of the songs were very nice and fitting, there was just way too much focus on them imo.

The story doesn't feel well written at all.

"The latest one piece film is a visual and musical feast for fans old and new alike. The center focus is on Uta, a childhood friend from Luffy's past who is none other than Shanks' (adoptive) daughter. She uses her talented singing skills to charm the audience and usher in a new era of peace. But at what cost will she manifest her dreams? Uta is an exemplary example of an anti villain done right. She grew up seeing how much despair pirates cause with their mayhem so she set out to make songs to soothe the hearts of their victims. She genuinely wants what isbest for the world but goes about it in the worst way possible. I loved the dynamic she had with Luffy. It started out as a cheerful reunion between two distant friends before their clashing ideals results in conflict. Luffy embodies the idea of freedom while Uta uses forceful measures so everyone follows her version of happiness. This contrast makes the drama all the better. Seeing Uta devolve from a high spirited girl to a broken martyr was so gut wrenching to sit through. I truly feel that she's one of the best female characters in the entire franchise from just one movie alone.

The animation and music were also stunning throughout the entire movie. Uta's musical numbers were vividly animated and full of detail. Character designer Masayuki Sato elevated Oda's designs to the next level and brought them to perfection. I wish he was the main character designer for the anime, but the art has improved ever since the Wano arc began so I'm content. The animation goes full throttle during the final battle against Tot Musica where all the straw hats and Shank's crew team up, albeit indirectly. One piece has never looked so eye catching before. Buffy briefly tapping into gear 5 in the final battle was icing on the cake.

Ado absolutely killed it on this soundtrack. I've been a fan of her since discovering usseewa and she doesn't disappoint at all. Each song captures how Uta feels at the current moment in the film and sheds light on her character. My favorite songs are the victorious sounding ""Backlight"" and the captivating haunting "" Tot Musica"", which is also the name of the ultimate villain in Red. Fun fact, Tot Musica was composed by legendary composer Hiroyuki Sawano, the same guy who worked on titles like Promare and blue exorcist. He's not the only high profile name on the list either. New Genesis is composed by Yasutaka Nakata, a man who played a pivotal role in the 2000s J-pop scene. I'm hoping these ambitious musical collabs become more common in one piece soon.

Overall, One piece film Red outshines all other films in the franchise with its gripping character drama and impeccable soundtrack. You can officially watch the movie on Vudu.",False,anime_review,50410,2023-07-16T19:35:00+00:00
"In a Worldline far removed from the one piece world, lies a story that is being told. A tragic story of one who wanted to bring about a new era. Her name was Uta and this is her story, one of laughter, tragedy and warmth. This movie is a condensation of everything themeatic about one piece and its pretty sad that alot of people dont seem to get it, but praise the series as for its deep themes and maturity. IS it just because this movie is non canon? Is it just because theyre salty shanks isnt evil nor does he fit their headcanon of what he shouldbe?
Is it just because they dont like the musical aspect or Uta?
Is it just because they think this is just a ripoff of naruto?
Perphas its all of this, we will never know but lets get this out of the way.
Yes the movie could be better paced, and it defintely could use more runtime, i wont dare to tell you otherwise, but im just saying to understand the kind of story oda wanted to tell.


The basic plot of the movie is in laymans term 
&gt; the strawhats and a whole bunch of other important characters just decided to drop everything theyre doing and attend the concert of this new diva idol called uta. 
&gt; We find out from luffy that she's shanks daugther.
&gt; She then evantually turns on luffy for being a pirate whom she proclaims to hate
&gt; She traps all the pirates that attended her show and chased after luffy with her fans.
That's it, the whole rest of the series is just a mystery box of figuring out Uta's goals, her motive, her powers and resuce everyone.
In a different worldline, 
we cut to a kakera sprinked throughout the story which tells of uta's relationship with luffy .
TBH this was my favorite part of the movie,
as oda has said before this movie challenges luffy beyond just physically and its shown throughtout the film
Uta isnt someone luffy wants to actually beat, nor does he directly attack her for anything, hes being challenged mentally and emotionally, hes confused that someone he used to know turned out so different.
It was never about just beating the opponent in this case.
Its about truly understanding why someone would turn to the dark side.
Sometimes the answer is never just about beating the opponent to be done with it.
OF course, in the end this is a box office action movie for a battle manga so ofc it ends in a big thrown down fight against a giant thing with alot of sakuga which im cool with but can see why others find it a controversial film.


On another facet of the kaleidoscope, the mystery element i would agree is handled pretty badly, which is one of the few elements i would say is handled badly and would agree on.
So much buildup for all this mystery elements, only for most of it to be plot expo dumped on us in the last 3rd of the film. And utas motive which were initially great, ended up being filmsy after a certain reveal. 


The musical elements to be honest tied in super well with the plot and premise, its the ideal mix. I dont see why people are upset with it tbh, it makes the film unique and gives it color. It ties in very well with the theme of the movie, music uniting people.


The themes, which is imo the best and my favorite parts of the film.
There are quite a few but i would say theres 3 main ones.
- Music unites people, as i mentioned eariler. The symbolism is best shown when everyone unites to defeat the big bad, who is named after a musical entity, they unite everyone with a singular goal and even before that, utas entires goal is to unite the world with her music, if you replace the theme of music with freedom and you literally get your main theme of one piece right there.
- Life may be hard but that doesnt mean escapism is good. The NPCs characters were initially happy at being able to escape and even desire for escape from the cruel world and reality but once they got it, they started to realise it wasnt good and wanted out. This ties into the next main theme very well.
-Expecations of a messiah, the show keeps emphasising that uta is the savior that will bring the world peace and save the suffering people which evantually leads to her mental breakdown and her deranged plan. Both ties into the idea of toxic otaku mindset.
Both idol worship and escapism are prominent in reality these days, and no wonder the world is a shit place.
But that doesnt make it ok for you to escape into a false reality nor is it ok to look for a false savior , whether it be an imganiary one or a real one.


And yet all of this ties into the deeper one piece lore too, luffy DOES end up being the messiah of sort, and he will evantually be one for spoilers reasons, if you know you know.
The climax scene power up is reflected on that, he will evantually bring freedom to the world, but he wont force it on anyone like uta does and that in lies the key difference.
Heck even in the movie, luffy only got fully serious once he saw uta truely suffering and she wanted to be saved as well as once he fully got her story straight.
Heck the idol worship theme is also a good mirror for luffys worship of shanks, he worships him but he knows that shanks isnt an end all god, hes just someone luffy wants to surpass, and hes able to see shanks for who he really is, hence why he knew uta was wrong about shanks from the beginnging.

"This is the only movie I've seen where the singing is better than the rest of the movie combined. The writing is questionable at best, and tries too hard to jam in everything One Piece fans recognize. That leaves no time for any kind of character establishment or development; the movie assumes you already know all the characters and just want to see them do their signature thing. The 3d animation is not good. The 2d animation is surreal, even more than One Piece normally is, and ends up being incoherent. The whole movie is more of a fever dream than a satisfying story.

"First of all the movie is not for everyone! If you expect action like Stampede, i wouldn't recommend One Piece Red! If you disregard that, movie Red is relatively solid! The best thing about the movie is in my opinion the music! The female singer Ado can express her feelings perfectly! Especially ""Blacklight"" shows a touch of musical perfection. Besides the music, you have to honestly say that the story is ""ok"". Nothing really special but seeing the Strawhats along some other characters(spoiler) was very cool to experience!

"This movie was just perfection to my eyes. It has everything to love if you are a fan of the series. The action is very enjoyable, and the animation is very crispy. I loved all the designs for the movie and the envinronment was eye candy. The biggest con of this movie is its for sure its music. There are a TON of bangers to listen to, i came home and im still banging some tracks and i will probably still do for days to come. The star of the movie Uta does not disappoint at all. She fit to the story extremely well and ilove how oda implemented her. She is a very enjoyable,complicated character with a lot of depth to explore.

I enjoyed his presence in the movie and the fact that we got more actual canon information about him and his crew is just amazing.The strawhats did have a nice part in the movie and i liked them in total but they got outshined by Shanks and Uta which i loved this decision.

"I am a huge One Piece fan, although i dislike most of the movies i have watched so far. After watching Stampede a while ago i went into this movie with low expectations. I just wanted to have a good time in an almost sold out cinema screening with some friends, regardless how the movie would turn out. But I was positively surprised, especially from the first two thirds of the movie. Even though i knew the movie was about the singer ""Uta"" it turned out to be way more musical like than i expected. Before seeing the film I only heard the main theme ""New Genesis""which i quite liked. But throughout the movie there are many more songs sang by the artist ""Ado"" which are really the highlight of One Piece Film Red. 

Although not canon, the plot of the movie is way more interesting than i anticipated. Of course you could see some twists from a mile away but I would never have guessed who the antagonist was going to be.

The Action scenes were sadly incredibly boring. They were so hectic and all over the place that most of the time you had no idea what was going on. I guess it is hard to write good action scenes in a non canon movie where nothing is at stake, but the fighting was still the weakest aspect of the movie. The main problem is probably, just like for many One Piece movies as of late, the sheer number of charackters packed into it. We have the strawhats, Law, The Marines, CP0, The Red Hair Pirates, Big Mom Pirates and so on. There is no time for all of these charackters to get good written and noteable scenes in a two hour movie, so many of them are just quickly packed into some short action scenes.

If you have the chance to see the movie in the cinema, i would say go for it, it was a nice experience. I don't know if I would watch the movie alone at home, although you should listen to the soundtrack. Just search ""utas songs"" on youtube and you will find a playlist from the artist ""Ado"" containing all the songs (and even her singing ""Binks Sake"" which is really cool). My personal favorite is ""逆光"".

Note for Collectors:
Sadly in germany there was no short Manga / Artbook when visiting the cinema screening like they did for ""Jujutsu Kaisen 0"" and ""Demon Slayer Mugen Train"". On Ebay you can find the ""Uta Volume 4/4"" and some posters from Japan. There is also the possibility to buy the CD containing the soundtrack. The first limited edition CD has great design and will look amazing in the collection.

"As a general rule of thumb Shounen anime movies are pretty s**t. They have pretty crappy antagonists, no real plot and just have every mildly important or popular character show up for 10 seconds of screen time for some contrived reason. Commonly the main character will get a single-use powerup (Naruto will get a new one-use Rasengan, Goku will get False Super Saiyan, Deku will get some glove that lets him use 100% punches then it never appears again.) One Piece MOSTLY follows the trend pretty well, although I think it's movies tend to be much better than the average shounen slop. Most of the villainsare better written and more compelling, single-use power-ups aren't given out like candy either. However, Film RED is easily one of the worst One Piece movies, up there with STAMPEDE. Uta completely sucks as a character. Extremely powerful, related to important main characters, retconned in despite no previous mentions... Is this a character written by the manga's author, or an 11 year old girl's self-insert OC? Nonsense plot. Gear 5 hype moment for no plot reason. Just pure slop.",False,anime_review,50410,2024-01-11T13:05:00+00:00
"One Piece Film: Red 8/7/9/9/9 First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on my wordpress page. Which can be found through my profile. Although TLDR; personal feelings over „objective“/""critic"" mumbo jumbo. NOTE: Been a while since written anime “review” . So probably will be testing layouts for a while before settling on one. ❉In a nutshell: Powered music done right and tons of nakama power. ✦Story So this time around we get sort of a idol type approach with one piece movie. Anyhow, for the most part I felt that the storytelling was very enjoyable. It starts essentially with slow burn progress whereas you get to hear tonsof great music, but over the course of the movie it gets more and more dramatic. Which overall I felt it was done right. We also get the usual comical relief on less dramatic scenes as well. Although some stuff regarding the plot felt very dumb though, but eh, that happens often with OP.

Anyhow, as far as story goes. The progression “steps” were great and overall movie was quite enjoyable and even emotional enough.

✦Character
Firsts things first, we get to see tons of characters to show up again and for whatever reason everyone teams up with everyone, which felt like ultimate nakama power type of character presentation, which I found rather idiotic, but eh.. whatever.

Only real worthwhile mention is the main character of the movie “Uta” aside being fostered daughter of Shanks, she had somewhat interesting character in her…, but her “backstory” and the whole drama of herself and her actions was the main focus, which overall was great. She was essentially insane and coping, which was entertaining to watch.

✦Art &amp; Sound
Lots of great music with Uta and animation was top notch, plenty of detailed moments with very flashy combat and very fancy song presentations. Although, full blown CGi moments were awkward like usually it is with 3DCGI moments in the Anime world….

✦Enjoyment &amp; Overall
All things considering it was a great movie, visited it even in cinema, since we had it here in our country. Lot’s of very enjoyable music, fun fights, good drama &amp; did even get emotional a bit on few occasions.
I do love powered music in the world of Anime. Symphogear &amp; Takt would be superb examples, they simply much more fun versional than crappy western “musicals”. And in this movie it was over the top world building (in a literal sense)",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-12T01:19:00+00:00
"""One Piece Film: Red"" is a strange movie, and even stranger entry in the One Piece franchise. Throughout the movie, 'divisive' was the word I kept landing on -- both for me personally, and how I predict the fans will react. There are some moments I would die to see again on the big screen, but all my favorites were very out of place for a One Piece movie and not worth the lows it took to get to those highs. -Story and Characters- As a newcomer to the One Piece world ""Film: Red"" committed the cardinal sin of anime movies: I was much lessexcited about the franchise after watching this movie than I was before. Despite seeing it less than a day ago, the story is foggy at best. I remember what I watched, but if I had nail down the plot, I'd be at a loss. I cannot think of a single productive thing the main characters did to develop the plot along, and their story was clearly just padding to take a break from the movie's main focus: Uta. ""Film: Red"" is without a doubt her story, and even Luffy is merely an observer in her One Piece movie. 
If you like Uta, you'll be well-fed. While starting as a one-dimensional idol trope, Uta's personality and motives unravel as the movie goes on, and twists get thrown her way. Despite being the smallest character on the poster, she is the only one with anything to do in the movie. If you were looking forward to big moments from your favorite characters, you won't get it here. Fan favorites are sidelined early on, and stay stuck or separated for most of the film. One Piece's wonderful cast of characters were mere prop in Uta's movie until the finale. Even then, every moment Luffy was on screen made me want to bang my head on the theater floor. The iconic main main of the franchise was swiftly made annoying, unlikeably stupid, and pointless in ""One Piece Film: Red.""

-Art and Sound-
While the story was making it difficult to stay awake, the art direction was the shot-in-the-arm ""Film Red"" needed. One Piece already has some amazing character designs, but Luffy and the Straw Hats have never looked better. The rendering is beautiful; the way the simply colored characters standout on watercolor-esque backgrounds means you'll never be looking at something dull. 
The biggest takeaway (by far) is the music. Uta is a Jpop star through and through and every musical number is as catchy as the last. Each song is accompanied by a fun choreographed dance, and animation that pulls it off flawlessly. The visuals when Uta performs will far and away be the most memorable part for anyone watching ""One Piece Film: Red"" and they look like mini music videos within the movie. You'll be replaying the songs and the scenes in your head for days long after the movie is done. 
It's all brought together in a gorgeous final fight that finally gives the movie some quality action. Even with dozens of brightly colored characters on screen, and flashy finisher moves every second, you won't get lost in the battle. The camera keeps it all in check and tracks the action very well. Music, action, characters, and story finally work together well in the final moments of the movie. 

The glory of a lasting franchise like One Piece, is despite the negatives and the filler, you can always at least something to enjoy. I was never as engaged as I wish I was, but to say I was disengaged would slight what I truly did enjoy about the film. 
To me, this says it best: there are scenes I sincerely can't wait for someone to clip and post online, but I never want to watch ""One Piece Film: Red"" as a whole again.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-09T22:11:00+00:00
"The movie is just an Ado concert. An expensive MV with the main characters special moves. The film's formula is: they took a list of the audience's most beloved characters, did some marketing research on metaverse and generation z, took a ready-made fanfic from the internet (Shanks' daughter) and a singer who is very popular in Japan at the moment. The main character is annoying and dumb. Unfortunately she has more screentime than all the Mugiwara. Her motivation is weak and makes no sense. Oh, to top it off, have her power create dozens of new figures for fans to buy complete sets of a cutepet-shaped boat, chibis of old characters, and pirate skins of current characters. Good marketing.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-05T05:41:00+00:00
"People who said this film is bad or mediocre are watching the film with their eyes closed. This film is at least an 8/10. The funniest complaint I've seen thrown at this film is that it's a glorified ""Disney Musical"" anime. Since when that is a bad thing? Everybody loves the Disney classics. Why do you think the term ""Disney Magic"" exist? Yea, the films capture that ""Disney Magic"" better than current Disney who kept pumping out soulless cash-grab live action remakes. They're doing a better job at being the classic Disney than the current Disney. This films feels like Fantasia but with actions. AndFantasia is amazing. I encouraged viewers to watch this film with an open mind and not immediately hating on a Shounen film for trying something new and uncommon for them. This film actually feels like very fresh take and format not only for a One Piece films but just as an anime films in general. While not perfect, it does a great job at telling the iconic an anime-esque emotional story telling style while balancing it with the musicals aspect.

The film is actually enjoyable. It's not just a glorified music video. It actually has plot unlike last film. The newly introduced characters and especially the main villain are well-developed. The villain in this film is certainly better and more fleshed out than Bullet. The fanservice are actually well made. The scores are amazing which is a given for Music-centric film. And the ending fight was very beautiful and wholesome with the parallels between characters.  The only biggest and main criticism for the film, is that it had quite an awkward and cringey opening with Luffy announcing he knows Uta and all to the public audiences. It's not gonna ruin the story or anything but yea it was kinda forced in. But that's a given since the opening act kinda needed to reintroduce some characters and give exposition so the newcomers or non-fans of the series won't get confused by the movie. This film allows itself to exist in a vacuum and be standalone. So it an understandable move. Honestly, because of this, I would recommend this film to even non-One Piece fans for how good it is. That's the short review/summary for the film. Now, for the unnecessary hate it gets from the critics.

Let's start with the biggest ""criticism"". It's Not-CaNoN. Good. I don't understand the obsession with Canon-only story. The  film is basically telling a self-contained story. Why would we need a canon film? For starter, One Piece canon story does not fit for a film structure cause like Super Eyepatch Wolf said, One Piece unlike other shounen series is not made up of big arcs that tells a self contained story, but rather a massive story told into smaller arcs. It tells the same story. Have you seen episode of Alabasta? That's what happened if you tried to cram in canon stories into a film. It's a shit show of pacing fest. Next, non-canon films are less scummy business tactics cause it won't capitalised on FOMO. Fans won't feel obligated to watched the film. And I feel sorry to fans who are in a country where the film didn't get a released. If it's canon, sucks to be them to have to waited for months to come and only probably  able to watched it through illegal means. And it would also not be confusing for fans to have to follow multiple mediums in order to fully experienced One Piece stories. Fans of canon can just ignore the film.and just read the manga. Lastly, non-canon stories allow for a director to creatively expresses themselves and explore themes/ideas where Oda doesn't have the opportunity to. Film Z, Strong World and Film 6 Baron Omatsuri explore some of the most interesting and unique themes, aspects and worlds of One Piece. Those are some of my favourite anime films of all time. Treat this film like a really good side quest in a game. It helps you explore mini stories that provides it's own fun mini games with interesting mechanics and themes without actually affecting the main storyline.

Now let's go the second biggest ""criticism"" which is lack of actions and too much song. Let's start for the action first. Duuh? I mean the actions are significantly less than last film. But it's because they actually TRY to tell a story. They focus more on the story and wold building of One Piece. So obviously the actions have to take a backseat a little. Not to say there's no action. There's still action, just not as much like last film (Stampede) where there's only action and everything else had taken a backseat. Honestly, Stampede doesn't even feel like it's made for cinema. The film feels more like an event like soccer where you watched at home with friends and cheer on. This film feels like it goes back to basic. One Piece had never been a generic Battle shounens. It's first and foremost an adventure story. And this film feels like a return to form like Z and Strong World. Next too much music. There's only like 8 music spread across a 1 hour and 45 minutes film. And some songs are not even sang fully. It's well used to tell a story and Uta's power is literally revolving around music. She's literally a weaponized music machine. Or if you play RPG games she, like Brook is literally a Bard who uses music as magics. The only difference is that she's like a full on Bard while Brook is also a master swordsman. 

Lastly, the ""criticisms"" about the lack of Shanks and Luffy's spoiler power up. Shanks part is just untrue. Shanks is constantly shown through flashback to expand Uta's and Luffy's characters. And again, without getting into a massive spoiler, have you seen the final fight? Second half of the film is filled with Shanks. People literally just want 1 hour films only featuring Shanks face. That's ridiculous. When I heard about these complaints, I was very worried that Shanks might just gonna feature in the film for like 5 seconds to react to the news and then peace out from the film. But minor spoiler warning here, he kinda played a big freaking role in the film. And it's not even false marketing from Toei. It's clear from the trailers, posters and all promo materials that these film will heavily centralised around Uta. Even the synopsis literally only says about Uta. And trust me if Toei had lied, gave false marketing and downright just scam/baited the audiences, I would be the first to jump on the bandwagon complaining against Toei. And for Luffy's spoiler power up, is again, not as big of a complaint as I thought it would be. The ""spoiler"" powerup only lasted for like a couple of frames to the point that if you blinked, you might had missed it. And maybe since I had marathon all One Piece films, I'm not as offended since. Toei are quite known for teases Luffy's powerup in films like in Film 7. And it's even out of context too. The only people who are truly offended by this, are people who actually already knew about it. So it's not that of a massive spoiler cause most people who have no clue about that form would probably would just write it off as rule of cool or (minor spoiler warning) just part of Uta's ability  to create that effect. 

I'm not even the company's biggest fan. I have a very love/hate relationship with the company especially when it comes to the show's pacing. I'm very critical to their films since I want to see how well they can carry the torch from Oda and whether they can tell a story that is in the same calibre of quality to his manga. And boy do I tell you there's a lot of bad/subpar One Piece films like film 3,5 and 8 (or that weird 3D one. But we don't talk about the 3D one). This film actually feels like it successfully carried the torch. This is genuinely a rare W for Toei. That being said, like any other films, it's not perfect and devoid of any criticisms. Like I said, the start was pretty awkward. But most of the general complaints about the film that are just being too unfair. And yes, there's more faults than just the start but I do genuinely feel most of my other complaints are just too minor to be affecting my overall enjoyment of the film. Please, try to be more open minded about this film and not expecting it to just be heavy actions. This isn't DBZ. It's One Piece.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-09-29T09:45:00+00:00
"My first Anime Movie experience at a theatre. It’s really great, love the singing performance by Ado and it was everywhere. The animation was 🤩 and watching one piece which such crisp was cool. Never expected such a plot twist, well proves that I’ve survived well against the spoilers lol. Anyway the best part was Shanks getting screen time as most of us needed although it wasn’t canon. The story felt a little bit too fast but it’s fine. I guess I could say it’s the best One Piece movie up to now and in terms of everything, cuz for example “Stampede” had good animation but I couldn’t enjoyit much, maybe cuz the plot wasn’t good enough for me……",False,anime_review,50410,2022-10-29T22:34:00+00:00
"Before I start this review, you need to note that I am a fan of the One Piece story who follows the latest developments through scanlation. So my review will be quite biased but let's get started. First, this movie is different from the modern one piece movies that have existed before such as stampede, gold, z, strong world. This movie does not rely on new antagonists to drive the story, they even use Shanks and Luffy's past stories which are still not explained much, creating a character named UTA and successfully inserting it into the story so that it seems canon with the overall story.UTA Devil Fruit also looks reasonable even though it made a lot of people confused at the beginning of the movie unlike my disappointment with Bullet Awakening.

The reason why UTA started the mission is quite clear, starting from the background, preparations and plans, as well as the potential danger to the world. So that made Navy and CP 0 like Coby, Blueno, Califa, Fujitora and Kizaru try to catch UTA. This also applies to Oven, Brulle and Katakuri who appear in the story so we don't get random characters who appear in the movie as cameos.

The Strawhat's crew didn't get much screen time in this movie but we can still see them in action in some parts of the movie. This movie is very focused on UTA, Shanks and Luffy and is a bit confusing if we want to consider this canon with the existing story whether this is before Wano or after Wano (Zoro still uses Shusui but Jimbe has joined the Crew) that's the difficulty of making a movie that feels like canon but doesn't fit from the existing timeline.

It must be admitted that there will be debate if we talk about the pacing of this film, but for me, considering the time of the movie which is usually 120 minutes with a very large number of casts and the necessity to explain the background, problems and developments of existing conditions. In my opinion, this pacing movie is very appropriate, plus I noticed that this movie was made for OnePiece fans as a series of 25 years anniversary, but it can still be followed by people who have just watched OnePiece, even though the effect is definitely different.

In this movie we get new information about Shanks (please pay attention in detail because this may be a foreshadow in Canon Onepiece story), the importance of musicians for ODA, 8 music from ADO which is very good and memorable and most importantly does not damage the power scaling of the characters that exists in the world of one piece.

But of course, of all the positive values ​​of this movie, there are still shortcomings of this movie. For example the use of CGI when UTA sings and repetitive choreography moves. But this doesn't mean UTA's songs are like the classic disney princess songs. Did you pay attention to the lyrics of the song? The songs here are the result of extraordinary collaborations from various Japanese artists. We got all of the music before we had access to watch the movie, and see that these songs (with the various traits they try to present) manage to be neatly integrated into the movie.

If you ask is this movie worth watching? The answer for me is ""Yes it's worth it"", because the music is cool especially if you hear it in the cinema, the story that seems canon and different from other films, the effect of Shanks on the story and the appearance of Shank's crew. And the emotional roller coaster that has been prepared in this movie starts from the comedy, mystery, and sadness that comes from ODA's intervention in the process of making this movie. I just hope you can also enjoy this movie without having to be an elitist who dictates that this movie should be like this and that. Just enjoy the ride till we meet again in the end of One Piece Story.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-05T22:55:00+00:00
"This movie is for already-fans of the series, its basically just fan service and a random story that's hard to care for. Visuals are always nice to look at, i wish the battle scenes near the end weren't chalk full of cringe moments, it felt like i was watching a power rangers combination scene. eugh However I thought the whole musical take on everything was a really nice spin on a one piece movie and the music was just really fun and enjoyable to listen too, it would have tied in really nicely if the story wasn't lame. I wouldn't recommend this to people who aren't alreadyinvested in the series, otherwise it can be really fun for long time fans to see a one piece inspired musical setting happen!

"I just saw it today, the day that I am writing this review. I will be vague. First off, I will say that I did enjoy the movie. I just think this one isn't as hype as the others. I see the reason for this, and if you watch then you'll also see that the villain isn't one that you can really rally against. It's not your typical One Piece movie, at least not like what we've been used to. It's not like Strong World, Stampede or Gold, etc. The fighting is kind of lackluster imo, you'll see what I mean. I will say that the songsare all wonderful and the singer has a beautiful voice. It's still a pleasant watch just not hype af.

"This is a good movie, not a great one. But with that said, it is still an interesting movie. It has hints at interesting themes, and it's plot is moving at 100 miles per hour. I mainly went to see this movie because I thought the musical content would make it entertaining enough (which it was); however I am a little disappointed in how much of a mess and inconsistent the actual incorporation of the music and choreography end up being. This doesn't hold a candle to something like Macross F or Love Live with regards to actually showing you someone singing on a stage. Thereis pretty much just poorly composited 3d animation, and jump cuts from poses to poses.  For what it is trying to do with it's musical numbers, it is incredibly mediocre which is a shame since the songs are fantastic and a one piece movie should in theory be able to pull the best talent in the industry.

If you were interested in watching this movie for it's musical content, I'd recommend just watching the second macross F movie, ""wings of goodbye"" instead.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-05T20:06:00+00:00
"This was the first one-piece movie that I watched in the movie theater and it was, in a way, boring. Like, I get it. This movie has good animation, and good sound designs, the plot is not so bad, it has all the characters that might raise your expectations, and also has some songs. But I will be straight to the point. This movie did not give me the one-piece vibe I was looking for. This movie was more like a typical Disney movie. The songs were good up to a point. But I think there were six songs and that is a lot fora film. If every song takes 4 minutes, that's one episode of an anime gone just by using the songs. 

The plot was good. But it could have been better. It was simple, yet complex. But no matter how good the plot is, if the execution is this boring, then it will not have a wow effect on the viewers.

The first thing that i want to say to all of you is that if you have Plans go to the cinema and watch it go it has more fun with friends than alone at home and watch it. Second thing is that the whole thing was Fight, Music, Fight, Musicthe whole flow of this movie was like that. From the  2 hours of this movie was 1hour and 35minutes fight, story line and music. My Overall for this movie is 6.5 it was not that impressed but i understand that if i had some info from the series and etc it would be more fun but its ok. Last thing is that i want to say it had some CGI-3D animation that took everyone eyes you just see them and you think that you are playing some kind of game in the cinema screen.

"As a die-hard One Piece fan... Obviously the animation and singing was very good but the story was kind of ass and it didn't seem that well written. So visuals and Audio score pretty high but the overall content I'm just really not feeling it. So It's good and bad at the same time, leaving it PRETTY MID. The 3D stuff was kind of goofy as well, a lot of the characters behaviors just didn't feel right and responses were weak. It felt very bland, including the fight scenes especially it felt very unnatural like ""let's show each of these characters doing a move just for the sake of it""I've cried at a lot of one piece but this didn't even come close to making me tear up. It's just very clearly not written by Oda.
Low-key feels like a kind of mediocre fan fiction. Most characters felt off and not quite used right, both their personalities and their moves. The choreography seemed pretty bad most of the time it was very linear. 
The plot twists felt more like excuses for bad writing, even the ending doesn't make a lot of sense.",False,anime_review,50410,2025-04-13T14:02:00+00:00
"Here I thought One Piece Stampede was the best One Piece Movie, or so I thought until today. Though I've to note that probably and only probably, this movie will be to the liking of most One Piece fans, so if you haven't read anything or watched anything about One Piece, then maybe it'd be pointless to watch the movie, since you probably won't understand most of the things that happen in the movie or where all the hype comes from. Anyways, I found the movie great because: -The story was compelling but sometimes lacking. I liked it overall but I thought it would be alittle more complex and a little less convenient. Nonetheless, it stands out despite being the plot of a One Piece movie, so yeah, it's pretty good.

-The characters are literally the same as in the show, but adding a few new characters and getting back another few long-since forgotten characters. Uta was more nuts than I initally thought and well, Luffy played a nice role in the movie. The rest of the Straw Hat crew were just for the show, the battles and the flashing animation so I really can't take them into account.

-The thing that stands out the most in the movie is the use of the music to bring a new level of impact to the images, I mean, the music was so loud at the theatre that I may have busted my eardrums, but anyways, the added impact was real. The music interpreted by Ado (which were used for the battles and some other scenes) were part of Uta's way of fighting, so that was quite original. Moreover, the music made those scenes more fun to watch and more impactful, I mean, it went with a whole choreography and a stunningly great animation so the music just accentuated everything that was good about those battle scenes.

-The animation was actually superb, in general terms of course. There were a few low-detailed scenes, a fair amount of CGI (not as common as I make it sound) and quite a lot of AWESOME sequences, specially towards the end and somewhere at the middle of the movie.

Overall I give it a 9/10, since as I stated before, I really enjoyed it and consider it superior to Stampede. I wholeheartedly encourage all One Piece fans/readers/viewers to watch this movie.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-03T15:11:00+00:00
"TLDR: the best description for this movie isn't ''an OP movie that doesn't follow the main plotline'', but ''a rave musical concert that features OP characters'' and as such, was excellent. I'm not an OP fan, but hearing this is a non-canon movie I wanted to check it out for fun. The sorta messy plot probably left people confused as there are A LOT A LOT of things happening at once and wayyy too many characters, BUT even so, this movie was such a joy.

"It's a One Piece movie that does something different with it being more of a musical centred on the new character Uta, Shank's daughter. It's not action-heavy like previous movies. Uta herself is a complex character with clear mental issues, which is not what you usually see in One Piece. It delivers great songs, good animation and an emotional yet dark story. The last 20 minutes of this film are stellar! Don't come into this one expecting something similar to 'Strong World' or 'Film Z'. This is a unique experience for One Piece in general.

Expected more considering Stampede doesn't actually have a story but more of a character's revisit episode...and Film Red in the other hand felt like a filler episode that got a movie quality treatment. Really hope Oda could grasp back his old writing skills, as even the recent manga chapters also felt just not as impressive as the old days.

"Best Musical Movie in a while. That being said, not the worst One Piece Movie but DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST!!! When I first watched the trailer, I got excited and hope it can really outdid One Piece Stampede as we finally be able to see Shanks in action (anime version) for like 15 years. 1 main thing to be said though, I felt like Toei or Oda tends to experiments a lot with OP movies. We got Marines POV kind of (Zero), 4 recap movies (Episodes of Skypea, Nami, Chopper, Alabasta), 1 horror (Baron Omatsuri), addition to 14 movies (including this one) with Original Plot, and with the same as most of anime movies, the events is NON-CANON. Only certain parts of the movie going to be relevant (or not) in the canon main plot. ie; Shiki from Strong World is Canon but Luffy meeting him? Never happened. Also don't know when will he be brought up again. This time around, it's Uta aka Shanks's daughter. Great character design, very good Voice Acting performances. I became a fan of Ado after watching this. Such a great songs and that's it.

The Music and OST are the only amazing/ redeemable about Film Red. Plus the hype scenes like 30 minutes at the end. Aside from that, the plot has been very slow. Uta also not a great 'villain'. Warning for OP fans who are not caught up with the manga, the scene at the end has a MAJOR spoiler that it's not out in the anime YET so be reminded. Regardless, good musical movie.

"Loved it!!! But its not One Piece (Let me explain). I just saw the movie in theatres and have a few things to say about it. As a currently up-to-date fan of One Piece, I can say without a doubt, that this movie was much different from the One Piece that we all know and love. You would have better chances of mixing oil and water if you try to fit this movie into the canon storyline's the tone, pacing, and overall world building. In this respect, one could say the movie fell flat. HOWEVER, as an isolated experience, I found the movie to be quiteenjoyable. Being a huge Ado fan, the music was naturally the largest part of the movie for me. Hearing the full force of the vocals and visuals being exceptionally tuned to each sequence was a really great experience (One that is even better if you see it in theatres or at least with a good audio setup). 

Furthermore, though the writing definitely has its fair share of holes, the movie overall felt like a fairly well fleshed out story within a context of a singular event. For comparison, where I found Jujutsu Kaisen 0's several month storyline to be packed quite tightly into its runtime, the 2 hour (ish) runtime of Red gave the story enough time to breathe. Though the writing was not fully representative of Oda's ability to weave together a complex, multi-arc plot-line, it told its story well enough in the time it had. 

Final Thoughts: Don't go into this movie expecting spectacular writing. There enough detail to make the plot understandable and the rest was pretty much fanservice. HOWEVER, if you are willing to set that aside, the depth of the musical score and the poppy visuals are MUCH more than enough to keep you entertained the whole time.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-19T21:36:00+00:00
"Sincerely? The basics to create an interesting story for me were there, but I didn't like the development of the plot, which from the beginning was too surreal (and speaking of One Piece it seems a contradiction): the origins are not fully explained (who is really, as she got the powers and origins of the so-called secondary enemy), the story seems almost a fairytale fantasy (power influences more on a spiritual level than physical), some relevant characters do not even appear (almost inconceivable, given the time span where in theory the facts take place), the ties with the 2 main characters do not seem assolid as they would like to point out (I did not notice this great friendship between them, but a simple acquaintance), and certain moments could give greater importance (final shot sequence an example, I don't want to spoil). Although it has the defects already listed above (not going into too much detail), I would like to give it a 6, because in the end for some small thing in my opinion the film is saved, music in the first place (new genesis I've been listening to it for a few weeks , but these are details😂), which has a fundamental role (even if certain moments are too ""musical"" for me); also, some events I did not mind too much, so from that side it is not disastrous. In short, it is in the list of films that you see but that you will only remember for 2 scenes at the most.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-08T00:56:00+00:00
"A little bit of disclaimer, this is my first One Piece film. Before released, i think there's already article or something that stated this film doesn't focus on fighting but focusing on the musical part. AND THEY'RE NAILED IT! Ado voices just too good and basically carry the film. The amount of fan service are still reasonable and a bit nostalgic i must say. But, the story itself it's kinda complicated and if you dont really pay attention to it, maybe you'll lost track of it.

"My boyfriend describes this movie best, ""a lot of stuff happens but also nothing at all."" This movie is one of the few that are canon in the series but if you expect it to be plot heavy then forget it. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in emotional depth that is expressed through the music and songs played. If you don't plan on watching the film then I recommend at least listening to the soundtrack on Spotify. It's fantastic! Our female lead Uta becomes a songstress for the world thanks to the short video clips of her singing she sends out andshe decides to hold her first-ever concert for her fans but it turns out that the once pirate-loving Uta has changed and the Strawhats and some surprising friends must save her and themselves before it's too late.

Simple enough plot. However, we see the Pirate Age from the eyes of civilians within the first few scenes of the film. We as the audience have seen things mainly from the perspective of our Strawhats and we know that most pirates aren't like them but for once we are transported to what the average pirate does to the ordinary citizen and that the marines aren't as useful in dealing with them. This is where we know our gang comes into play to fix the problems the marines have let rot. Unfortunately, there are more Blackbeards and not enough Luffys in the world to deal with all the problems the world is facing.

By telling the story through songs we get to understand how the characters are feeling. In this case, Uta sings through the progression of her own emotional development throughout the film, and in turn, we learn more about Luffy, Shanks, and Uta and what being a Pirate means through Uta's backstory. 

I think actions speak louder than words and just like in the Fishman Arc when Luffy told the citizens to determine for themselves whether he was a hero or villain, we as the audience have to determine the worth of this film not based on plot but emotion. 

Do you like music? Anime? Music in anime? Emotional depth? Character-driven stories? Decent action scenes? Then this movie is for you, even if you're not a One Piece fan. It's just nice to look at and listen to overall.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-20T16:52:00+00:00
"the movie was promising to be the best one piece movie ever but for me didn't make the real hype happen(it was worth to watch but not as i thought it would be) if i were the studio to create movie about shanks i would literally created and made shanks a protagonist of movie and start to show his journy after roger death and making his crew and some mysteries around him to make him even more mystery (even show his duel with mihawk to the audience.)in my opinion the whole purpose of the movie was just earning money from shanks name(we just barely seehim) why do you even make movie about him by luffy being the protagonist?
beside all this the ideas used in story were good but the outcome and executive weren't great.and the movie feeled a bit stampede time movie which we just see too many fights in all the scenes with zero effort to make a great sequence.

as a result

if you are shanks fan you won't be enough happy about seeing him maybe for his powers!!
if you are stamped type movie fan go watch it
if you are more story wise type of human like me i don't recommend it even though it did show us some tiny important details to discuss",False,anime_review,50410,2022-08-10T13:31:00+00:00
"It was actually a pretty weak story... and a lot of the 3d animation actually looked off... expensive, but off... But, that said, the songs were a banger, and while as a whole, the movie's story felt weak, many of the individual scenes felt okay and if you watched the filler episodes leading up to the movie, then it's enjoyable, seeing Luffy and Uta reunite. They actually had good chemistry.... Like, after Luffy meets again with Uta, it's basically just event after event.... not much build up, not much characterization... very little dialogue... The character introductions suck, the motivation feels weak and frankly, the conflictcomes out of nowhere.

Like, a lot of it works more because we knew so many of the characters from the main series....

But, while the songs are top notch and Uta was a great character, it's a weak movie... not one of the best...

That said, I recommend watching it. It's still an enjoyable experience for One Piece fans...

But note, it's not because it's a good movie but because it's something nice to watch, if that makes sense.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-09-11T01:02:00+00:00
"A lot of people are reviewing this based on what they wanted the movie to be, and not what the movie actually was, so let me give you a more honest review. Many of the people who disliked this movie seem to dislike it for it's lack of action packed scenes, but my favorite parts of One Piece are the interconnecting storylines and plot more so than the battles. This movie was never meant to be action only, nor was it marketed to be. It's about Luffy's childhood friend, a singer who made him want a muscian more than anything, and is literally named ""song,"" andit is set at her concert, so of course it was going to have more music and plot than fighting. 

There are also a lot of people complaing about Uta herself, which is, quite frankly, a travesty. I believe more people would have liked here had the movie been just a little longer, allowing for her story to be a little les rushed. I love to pull apart stories and do in depth character analysis, and Uta helps put together so many of the missing puzzle pieces of Luffy's back stroy. Yet that flies right over people's heads as they hate on Film Red for not being an action based movie. I would go off on my analysis of her, but I don'twantto include spoilers.

It's tragic and emotional, and we get to see some of the more human parts of Shanks, like in chapter one of the series.  It adds a lot to the depth of canon even though the main event of the movie isn't canon. Uta is though! It was confirmed by Oda and she appeears as a silohoutte in a more recent chapter, so from this, we can assume that at least the childhood things might be canon. Though I do believethat people should take canon vs non-canon a little less seriously and choose to have fun with it instead. 

I cried while in the theater. 

In short, I adore this movie and Uta. It's quickly become my favorite One Piece movie, and I doubt anything can replace it now. I'm incredibly happy with it even if there were small things I would change just too keep it form seeming so rushed on the reveals. Though the rushing wasn't even that bad, I just pay too much attention to that sort of thing.

"I don't wanna admit but yes OP Red was not the best part in One Piece movies.

Yeah, I liked the last 15-20 mins with all the action, and also watching couple of my likeable characters (Katakuri) coming back to screen. Apart from that, the first half was not much interesting.

Movie really boring if we compare it with other One Piece films it is minus terrible there is no good antagonist and story is weak just good music and cinematics nothing more. If i should talk about Gear 5th scene it is not as i expect it should be longer scene but Luffy transform to Gear 4th Snake man then attacking Uta while he is attacking he suddenly transform gear 5th and nobody recognize aboutit just spends 5 seconds and one moment.

"This movie is pretty much a musical. There are bits of action, story and humor in between. Apart from the climax fight, this has no exhilarating action. I have given 1 or 2 stars extra just for the end fight. It has been a disappointing movie. The story (which was barely decent) has been underwhelmed by the huge array of songs. They could've built the character better. The connections between the characters could've been explored more to give depth. And it definitely needed more action/humor scenes.The previous one (Stampede) was the best of the series.
And this one is probably among the bottom rungs of One piece movies.",False,anime_review,50410,2023-03-15T17:40:00+00:00
"I feel like I got blue balls from this film. Don't get me wrong, overall I enjoy the movie, there's up and down and emotional roller coaster. Unfortunately as an One Piece movie, this was so anti-climatic. The story is far from the theme ""Pirate"" just your typical action shonen with a bit of musical here and there. It was a let down, personally I got more chills from watching clips of big fight of One Piece film on youtube than this film. But as a musical action movie, this is definitely a recommended one. They really did an amazing part on the musical aspect,the fight was great. The animation is definitely an eye candy (after Uta ofc), and the animation also really good. 
Even though we got couple of minutes of Shanks's power, it still left a big impression to the watchers. Uta's performance is definitely a SSS tier for me. 
In conclusion : 
1. If you want to watch this as a One Piece film, definitely not recommended. I rather choose to wait the Blue ray version of it. 
2. If you want to watch this as a standalone film (as a musical theme fan), this is a must watch.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-09-22T05:22:00+00:00
"Fun movie, but overall pretty underwhelming. Visuals and music is really good, Ado's singing really carries the movie. Everything else is just a mess though. The story is not very well written and there's a bunch of cameos from previous characters for no other reason than to have them there, they serve no purpose to the plot at all. It's fun sure, but doesn't make for a good movie. The episodes which give some ""backstory"" to Uta did little to nothing to impact my enjoyment of the movie at all so wouldn't worry about watching them before the movie. I enjoyed the movie and would giveit a 6/10 score on pure enjoyment alone, but unless you're a big One Piece fan I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it.",False,anime_review,50410,2022-11-17T17:26:00+00:00
"TLDR: Like arcane or the recent tekken animation - fanservice artwork, animation and choreography, stunning soundtracks, mid to bad story telling (feel free to fight me on this comparison lmao) I don't want to say much, but it's not worth watching really :/ I didn't want to know anything before the film, so I went in not knowing that is was a musical. That being said, the moment the first song played, I accepted it and tried to watch the film in a normal way but I couldn't. The story was all over the place. It was not compelling, barely related to shanks. It was an actionfanservicy, orgasmic music mess.

"I would rather to watch a concert than to watch this. Not worth the time and money. The Visual Effect and CGI is indeed great, but the song is just too much. The writers just magically cramped the movie so it fits 5-6 songs (literally a single album) in one movie. And then, in the end, they put 2 more ""sad theme"" song to baited audience's emotional after crappy one hour. Yeah, it's right, they ended literally song movie (I prefer to called it like that rather musical movie), with more SONGS with DIFFERENT EMOTION. So, literally minutes ago we got energetic happy song, andthen next we got furious rage song, and lastly we got ""forced"" sad song. My ear and brain is so confused, that I can't even laugh at 'marvel-like' jokes/comedy scene in-between songs.

It is also my fault, I didn't expect it to be song movie or musical movie or whatever. With the title ""RED"" - which I think about Red Hair Pirate, and it's not - and the gimmick ""Shanks' daughter"", I was expected to see more of Shanks' crew fight (they literally who saved the movie), but unluckily it didn't happen (it also makes me learn to read the synopsis carefully before watch any movies).

"My first review ever, and it had to be One Piece Film Red. Just want to clarify some things before you continue: 1- I'm the biggest fan of Ado. As a J-pop enjoyer, listening to her songs since 2021 made my life less hard sometimes. 2- Even tho I read the manga, I'm not a fanatic one piece fan, and I literally just watced the movie because Ado was singing. 3- This is gonna be so partial and not rational at all, but since it was a special movie (I was almost crying everytime Ado was singing bc holy smokes she rocks) I really wanted to write this. So, aboutthe movie, I saw a lot of bad reviews about it. About how Uta is a bad character, about it had too many songs in it and lastly, ""if I wanted to watch an idol movie, I would be watching an idol movie"". to be fair with you, it's a bit exaggerated, the songs were the best part (def not partial at all) and yes, there are people that are watching bc it has music involved. Overall, there were some inconsistency in the story but the animation was pretty enjoyable and last fight gave me goosebumps

For other people, since 90% of them are shounen fans and only want to see fights, I'm sure there will be lots of ppl that liked, but a lot more that didnt.

"Summary: Honestly, I'm dissappointed. If it wasn't connected to One Piece, I'd give it a 7/10 as it was a good Movie in itself. Since it has basically no connections to the main series though, it's nothing but a somewhat long Spin-Off OVA or Filler Episode. If you enjoy music stuff in Movies, you may enjoy this one, if not, save yourself the time and skip it - you are not missing out on anything important. A few more Details: As for the content... I guess Animations where solid and enjoyable - Some of the Music was decent too. Storywise, it didnt add anything that we may need inthe main story - classic side story. The MC for this also feels rather plain and forgettable except for the visual design - no deep thoughts or meaning behind anything. Any other character may as well be replaced with something generic and the plot would still work as is.

So basically, it's a good ""Movie"" but not a good ""One Piece Movie"" - I really expected something more interesting that connects to the main story.",False,anime_review,50410,2023-09-02T10:53:00+00:00
"The movie picks up after episodes 1029–1030, introducing Uta as the central character. If you're thinking of watching the French dub... honestly, don't. I made that mistake and it really messed up the experience for me. The singing voice for Uta in the French version just doesn't work. The songs sound off, sometimes even out of tune, and the voice feels totally disconnected from the character. It was hard to enjoy the film with that in the background. On the other hand, the voice actress for Uta's spoken lines is clearly a pro. Her performance is way better and actually pleasant to listen to. It really showshow singing and voice acting are two separate skills, and in this case, the difference is obvious. Probably why they didn’t use the same person for both.

"Megumi Ishitani’s Cinematic Masterpiece I was left with chills in almost every scene, and I couldn’t be happier with how it turned out. The blend of emotion, action, and storytelling was absolutely beautiful, reminding me of exactly why I love this series so much. The marines, in particular, stood out for me. The reanimation of Marineford was visually stunning, and seeing Oars Jr. in that heartbreaking moment hit hard. The Straw Hats brought their signature humor, adding a refreshing contrast to the heavier themes. What really struck me was how we were treated to a brief but powerful revisit of the Marineford war, a pivotal arc forany fan. One of the standout moments for me was when a marine, initially about to abandon his brother, saw Luffy's relentless determination to save Ace and turned back to help. That shift in resolve, inspired by Luffy's sheer will, was truly touching and beautifully handled.

Everything about it was perfection and it perfectly captures the soul of what One Piece is. In a single 24 minute episode it made me care for characters I've never seen until today and these characters and their stories have completely changed my perspective on the series as a whole. We never think about the lives of the average citizen or marine while watching/reading One Piece, it really shows us that these characters have lives, family's, friends people theylove and care for too.

"This is simply one of the best anime works ever made and the director Megumi Ishitani is guilty of it. First of all, in order to fully understand this episode and being able to appreciate all its details, it is needed to watch/read until the ""Return to Sabaody"" arc (included), since the whole plot is set in this framework of events. All the stories that appear in the episode are told from the very own perspective of the characters that participate in it. All this characters are normal persons (at least they are far away from the usual extravagant characters that Eiichiro Oda has all of usaccustomed to) and all of them are fans of the Straw Hats. This is what it makes them feel really special and very close, they are truly in tune with the wonders and amazing things the Crew has accomplished and are also inspired by them, making Megumi Ishitani suceed in connecting with the spectator, almost to the point of feeling to be part of the story.

Regarding the visual part, the animation is impeccable. The scenes are incredibly fluid and the drawing style is precious. But the best point of the visuals is the amazing visual language that Ishitani always brings into the episodes she directs, specially regarding the ilumination effects and light symbolisms full of meaningful messages without saying a single word. Here, we could talk about, for example: on how the girl is positioned in the dark when hope is fainting and how the light comes back when hope arises again; or how she is seen behind metal bars when she wants to be free and claiming liberty.

Furthermore, there are tons of details to pay attention to, many of the main events of the episode are consequence of side and secondary actions of the crew members that one could not even imagine when seeing the original series for the first time. To state a few examples: the concert Brook gives in Sabaody originates huge crowds of people that make the little girl impossible to keep moving forward; the iconic scene of Rayleigh stoping the marines from pursuing Luffy is a big deal for the marines of this story; the enormous bugs and insects that Usopp bringed are incredible menaces for the protagonists; it also appears the comical scene of the World Government secret agents catching the fake Chopper, crashing with the girl and making her stumbling; and many more.

In few words, this episode tells the stories of fans of the Straw Hats, that, as well as the spectator, admire the crew. The great amount of feelings and emotions this episode awakens is what it makes it a ""must see"" for every One Piece fan.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-20T08:40:00+00:00

"''every little thing is changing my life little by little.'' One piece fan letter is without a shadow of a doubt a genuine masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly. I have been a one piece fans since I was 14, I remember reading syrup village in class as my friends urged me to keep reading. I fell in love with One Piece very quickly and since then it has been a monumental thing in my life and after watching this I truly think it always will. This is a love letter to One Piece fans, and Megumi Ishitani was the perfect person to direct this. Ishitani is apowerhouse and in recent years has brought us some of the most mesmerizingly beautiful animation I've ever seen through her sequences and direction on episodes of the One Piece anime and she doesn't disappoint here. The animation is beautiful with a stacked animation staff on clear display.

The story is also something that caught me off guard, it's a story about the Straw Hats influence on every day people in the One Piece world and it's placed around the Return to Sabaody arc and Marineford arc. 

It's so heartfelt in a way I never thought a One Piece spin off could pull off and I was crying by the end and my friend who also watched this with me cried as-well, I have never seen him cry before this.

One Piece is a powerful series and if you have any amount of love for it, watch Fan Letter. You will fall in love with One Piece all over again.

"Megumi Ishitani blessed us with another top-tier directing technique. After following One Piece for years, seeing another side of the story is just so beautiful. We are really put in other character's shoes on how they perceived the One Piece world and the Straw Hat Pirates. Seeing Luffy's development, Zoro and Sanji debate (LOL), and other characters in this point of view brings some sort of happiness as a fan. Not to mention the animation, cinematography, and all the other techniques used in this special episode is just like seeing episode 1015 for the first time again. These techniques make me relate to how thesenormal people think about the Great Pirates Era. It shed a tear of happiness from my eyes.

Definitely recommended, especially if you've been following One Piece for so long!!",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-20T05:23:00+00:00
"Do you recall ever getting so invested in a few characters in a first episode that it felt like they were around for an entire series? In anything? No, right? Well, think again; In just a few minutes this episode manages to encapulate the magnitude of the One Piece world, which is so big, that doing so feels impossible, at least, before meeting this masterpiece. Beatifully using the scope of every day people that are, just like us, admirers from afar of this crew, even though they live in the same world, the creaters manage to in a very short 20 minutes; Introduce acharacter, her motives, and givie a fulfilling end to her journey without making it feel rushed at all, and, that, with a gorgeous animation. No words. Honestly, even if you're not a One Piece fan,
 
Watch it.

"(This story took place in “Return to Sabaody Arc” Ep 522) One Piece Fan Letter is a piece of tribute to the fans of the series 25th anniversary. Crafted in such fashion that celebrates both fans and its long-running volume by tying us viewers in a little story from the perspective of an ordinary side character, that just particularly deepened One Piece world beyond fiction. This little tale wasn’t just deep and well executed, but also woven a filler event into its main storyline that actually came out as a crucial turning point in the story. The Straw Hats impacted the whole world, but now theworld impacted One Piece storyline in an extent you haven’t seen much of anywhere. By tying the fans and the viewers of the series like they are actually part of the story. They are present in the journey of both the Straw Hats and in the series success. 

The way they gave characters personalities and topics to debate on the Straw Hats crew members based on the fans of the series made One Piece already huge world even wider. As it ultimately just brake down the boundaries between fiction and reality. By giving characters fannish-stereotypes and connections to helping the Straw Hats, admiring or hating them. It was all there and it was beautiful, it was emotional. 

Everyone is part of the puzzle, everyone is holding a piece of the journey. As the true OG viewers are now invested 25 years of their lives into this fiction, is really a recognition saying; They see us. They acknowledged the fans in such an incredible storytelling, that I have never seen anywhere else before. It definitely could be the best episode of 2024, but I could go even further to say this might just be the greatest episode of all times.

It was truly exceptional. Definitely a piece of work that made me moved, even though I only watching the show since 2023. 

Personally, I really loved this type of animation they chose to go with. This loosely and curvy design as it gives you the feeling of freedom, the freedom of art. Which One Piece is all about and although it’s not fancy or super detailed, there wasn’t any static frame, it always had movements and colorful animations, which was also hand drawn by the way. 

So hats off to all the people who have worked on this project and may I address my highest respect to Toei Animation Studio for their 25 years of dedication and pure excellence. 

As an anime fan, you have to acknowledge greatness and this was: Marvelous

Final Score: 9/10 ⭐️

"I hate that I'm a One Piece fan. The big arcs, the big backstories, the characters. There's always something that destroys me with One Piece, and I thought this was just a simple little thing. A fun episode, with great animation, and a great little plot. Like a short-film about the world, but even this little thing can get me crying. 20 minutes, that's all it took. We don't follow the original crew on this one, but the public perception on their biggest moment. Instead of a grand fight, or a grand moment, we just get people, and how from their simple, and outside outlooktheir lives changed. There's something about Luffy, a hotheaded kid, with an earnest desire to save the ones he loves against unsurmountable odds, which inspired a soldier, to save his brother. Something in Nami, a smart, non-powered human, changing the world with pure wit and tools, which inspires a little girl to change the world. 

Each character has that little something, which echoes throughout the world. Their efforts aren't meaningless, their efforts change lives, and motivate those around them. It makes their story not only being important to us, but important for the world around them. They save lives, not only with the actions they take, but with those who look at such actions. 

It's so fresh, seeing a positive chain reaction of pure hope. We always get the cycle of violence, the cycle of sadness, and despair. Not many times we get something so hopeful, that makes the world a better place by simply happening. It made me cry not from the tragedy of it all but from happiness. Not a good deal of anime cause that, and One Piece can certainly focus a lot more on the tragedy, but that's exactly what makes this so perfect. 

So many tragedies, so much horror in that particular world. For once, we get the glimmer of hope. These people, small, or big, old or young, all of them can change the world, piece by piece, action by action.

Brilliant animation, brilliant characters, and an unmatched fast pacing that tells everything so fast, and so effectively. It was perfect. A perfect piece of One Piece. 

10/10. We need more overwhelmingly happy moments like this.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-11-16T13:05:00+00:00
"The special episodes of this anime are very touching, as a nakama who watches always spotlight on the main character, you are invited to imagine the side character's story. very simple packaging but very warm. this is my review as a common viewer. While this may be a side story to the main narrative, the anime has a strong emotional appeal. It highlights the sense of friendship, inspiration, and dreams that are at the core of One Piece. While it doesn't provide a major plot that relates to the main storyline, “Fan Letter” manages to provide reflective moments for viewers who have followed the adventures ofthe Straw Hats over the years.

Overall, One Piece: Fan Letter presents high-quality graphics with a heartfelt story, making it the perfect offering for longtime fans looking for a more personalized experience in the world of One Piece.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-22T19:12:00+00:00
"genuinely so good and a must watch for a longtime one piece fan, chronicles like a slice of life from right before they reunite in the timeskip and really reminds you about all the positive perspectives towards the straw hats (from the navy, from the young girl) that the paramount war amplified for everybody. from very early on we have been reminded how even their 'enemies' can be their biggest supporters, and that there is a greater moral good than just being on the side of black and white. i think it's hard to remember that when it's not said out loud, and this fanletter really captures raw perspectives we otherwise don't get because we are always seeing things from the straw hats' pov. the straw hats are so loved and this was truly a fan letter to one piece itself. the ending theme was so nostalgic - really love how it fully throws us back to the timeskip arc with the same theme song redone!",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-20T06:27:00+00:00
"I'm genuinely surprised by the quality of this One Piece's special episode. The animation, and characters designs are all on point. Props to Toei Animation. A refreshingly humane look at the wonderful world of One Piece, in this episode, you get to look at the 'normal' people that live there. What are their feelings and thoughts on the 'larger than life' Straw Hat? How to live in the world of super human when you're just everyday ordinary folks? Find out yourself since the special is only 25 mins long. I would love a series out of this concept.

"It's abundantly clear that pure heart and soul went into this project. Fantastic, impactful, and such a fresh perspective in the ridiculous world of One Piece through incredibly expressive animation. Fans of One Piece and animation will appreciate this special. In the past, Toei animation has not had the best reputation when it came to producing anime, especially when it comes to One Piece. I don't blame their dip in quality after the time skip. As an animator and artist myself, I fully understand that what they're doing to produce a 20 minute weekly series of animation is quite literally a miracle. Any viewer backduring the airing of Dressrosa arc of One Piece would most likely by turned off from the anime for years due to the incredibly slow pacing and cheap animation tricks. However, in these past few years I have seen tremendous increase in the quality of work that is honestly above and beyond what any fan of One Piece could have believed. Whatever they changed about their production, it has improved everything for the One Piece anime.

I am not one for ""glazing"" only specific people of a production because in reality it is a team effort that makes the project possible. However, it is undeniable that Megumi Ishitani is a tremendous director, evident by the cinematography and visual, and deserves all of the praise that is coming her way.

One Piece Fan Letter is a love letter not just to the characters and the world of One Piece, but also to the fans who have stuck with the franchise for all of these years.

"7/10 ~ how did I get here So I dont one piece really, and this just auto played after I finished watching Dandadan, but I had no idea what I was watching but said fuck it, its only 24 minutes. And my god, this was a fantastic little piece here, im sure this would hit much harder if I truly understood what was going on during this little film. I did not know the events they were referring to but I could follow it all well enough. This felt like one of those pre-film Pixar shorts like the Oldman playing chess or w.e, and it waspretty refreshing to just sit back and watch the gorgeous animation with a pretty nice conclusion. 

If I do ever make the journey and do actually watch Once Piece in its entirety im sure ill come back and re-appreciate this one.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-12-21T14:46:00+00:00
"A New Standard of Excellence for the 23-Minute Format “Nami-san, you're my hope. In this world where power is everything, even if I get hurt and trampled on, I still want to struggle, run, and live as freely as I can. I came to think that way thanks to you.” One Piece is a fictional world that faces many of the same issues that ours does: corrupted government, revision of history, censorship, unchecked greed, political unrest, poverty, sickness, and starvation. Fan Letter explores the individuals who inhabit that world, affected by its follies. What gives them hope? What gives them courage? What gives them empowerment? Just likeus, in the world where One Piece is not reality, but a story, it is their heroes. In Fan Letter, I see an illustration of those like you and me — like our brothers, mothers, friends, and neighbors. Through the eyes of characters pushed around in a corrupt, hurting world, I find empowerment, hope, and the courage to keep living in my own corrupt, hurting world. That is the power of storytelling. That is the power of Fan Letter.

Megumi Ishitani is a directing marvel — peerless in her craft as far as I am concerned. I have watched Fan Letter three times now, reached an emotional catharsis I can only describe as nirvana, and noticed new details which add to that experience each time. For those overwhelmed by the pace and depth of Fan Letter, rewatching is its own reward. You will get something new out of it every time, your love for One Piece renewed. The animation and artwork itself powers the story to its fullest potential, adding to the visual depth and joy of a story which could be moving all on its own. I would be remiss not to mention the abject artfulness of the story on top of its narrative, but that could be a review all on its own.

The ultimate recommendation I have for those interested in watching (or re-watching) is to keep in mind two meanings of “fan” and “One Piece”: what they mean in the story, and what they mean to us as fans of the show. Beautifully illustrated as puzzle pieces, the characters using their “one piece” to complete an unseen puzzle. These serve as “ah-ha” moments for the characters involved; a moment where their place in the world comes into crystal clear perspective as an action — there is something they can do or become to make the world a better place. Incidentally, these are actions which aid the Straw Hats in their journey. The implication is that there is power in the small acts of good we do — the ripple effects of self-actualization and standing up for brief moments of goodness and bravery add up to the wave which is the dawn of a New Era of peace and prosperity in their world.

The narrative encourages us to consider — what is our “one piece”? Have you experienced that moment yet, or will you be encouraged to look at your life with new eyes, eager to discover it? Will you, like me, feel overwhelmed with gratitude for stories like One Piece, that encourage us to be better humans in our own world each day? It is my deepest wish for everyone to experience the power of this piece of media, and find their own power within it as well.",False,anime_review,60022,2025-02-19T12:18:00+00:00
"* Made me emotional, happy and terrified of the one piece world grandeur. i can relate to the problems experienced by these side character and how small and powerless they are in the grand scheme of things just like in real world. 10/10 animation 10/10 story telling 1/10 cause i want 9 more episodes of this greatness. If you are a person who is interested in world building and every minor detail you'll love this whole series and this special fan letter. Btw i think the change in artstyle actually really complements the show. One Piece: fan letter is a masterpiece of world-building, storytelling, and animation. The episode is full ofemotion, happiness, and terror, as we are introduced to the vast and dangerous world of One Piece. The side characters in this episode are all relatable and sympathetic, and we can't help but feel for them as they struggle to survive in a world that is so much larger and more powerful than they are.

The animation in this episode is simply stunning. Every detail is perfectly rendered, and the action sequences are both thrilling and visually impressive. The storytelling is also top-notch. The episode is paced perfectly, and the plot is both complex and engaging.

However, there is one major flaw with this episode: it is too short! At only one hour long, the episode feels like it is just getting started when it is over. I would have loved to see at least nine more episodes of this greatness.

If you are a person who is interested in world-building and every minor detail, you will love this whole series and this special fan letter. The change in art style actually really complements the show.

Absolute peak storytelling and animation. If you are a fan of One Piece then consider this an absolute must watch. It was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. Truly the world of One Piece is full of boundless potential to tell deep stories even in shorter formats like this.

"I literally made a MAL account and waited a week to write a review about how amazing this special episode was. I was expecting NOTHING from the episode but now, I'd sell my soul for a spin-off series focusing on normal citizens in the world of One Piece. The episode itself was a roller coaster ride. It's funny one moment, emotional in another. Despite the short screen time of the characters, it was surprisingly easy to grow attached to them by the end of the episode. They were all very well written despite the short runtime. Rewatched it few times the week it was released.Genuinely wished it was an hour long. It's just so genuinely beautiful and I can't describe it any other way.

The animation also suits the overall whimsical aspect of One Piece. You can tell that the episode was made with a lot of care and consideration both towards the fans and One Piece itself. Long-time fans would definitely enjoy this episode. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who only watches One Piece for the sake of it or just for the action.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-11-12T20:37:00+00:00
"The main things that this special entails is overall good animation, callbacks, and iconic moments from One piece plus some cute moments. As to why the animation is not perfect is due to some ugly still shots of the marines but overall the animation is smooth and looks fairy tail like and easy on the eyes. This special really highlights how other characters in One Piece sees the main crew and other great figures in the One piece world as well and why they Admire them, there are different reasons for different individuals as well which makes it more interesting and nuanced. And the twomain characters who has the most love put in them are likeable and enjoyable to watch as well because they contrast well with one being a naive girl and one being a war torn Marine so you do not have to have watched One piece before to enjoy this experience. 
However because of this, the episode splits to too many different perspectives which makes most of the characters existence about glazing someone else instead of developing their own story or moments. It is not all that bad though because the characters that we follow the most reinforces their own character by taking inspiration from notable characters of One piece. so the director made the best out of this problem. It still does not mean I would enjoy the story more than a story that focuses on characters who develop from their own experiences and connections instead of them having their character being about only being a ""x"" fan. Especially when the run time only is 24 minutes, and yes the purpose of the episode is to celebrate one piece and its cast. But it actually makes or breaks the story and is why there is so much disparity between One piece fans and bystanders who watched the special, because One piece fans love the glazing, and some bystanders hate it because they have not grown to like the ones being glazed. Not as if its the entire reason behind the disparity but it is a big part since it also spreads out the potential scenes for characters to have their own agency in the plot.
 In contrast, it is a lot more clear that the OST is as good as it has always been, the music both new and old fits the scenes very well. Especially the new music tracks that was made for the brothers and for the finale for the atmosphere. By the way the finale was amazing for what it was and really tied this mini story together by using what we know about the plot and the characters with the ost blasting full swing. 

 So it was a pleasant experience overall, I do not advice watching this if you hate One piece but if you are neutral or like One piece it is a good to great watch.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-30T16:24:00+00:00
"This was SUCH an incredible little one-off idea. Just a single episode that showcases various no-name background characters within the world of One Piece and how the Straw Hat Pirates have indirectly influenced their lives, despite not being pirates or having any actual connections or relationships with any of them. Just like how Detective Pikachu is a detective movie that just so happens to take place within the world of Pokemon, Fan Letter is a story within the One Piece world, but has absolutely nothing to do with One Piece or pirates or the great, overarching narrative as a whole, really. Which I REALLY, reallyloved! I'd be up for an entire show with this concept, despite how much I hope Oda retires and gets 1000 years of sleep that he so desperately deserves and needs once One Piece is finally finished. I also love that they just went with an ENTIRELY different art style for this one, just for funsies! It's all so bouncy and vibrant and looks ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like One Piece, which just works in its favor in trying to be a completely detached side story. I say ""completely detached"" but this story does still take place within a very specific moment in One Piece that you DEFINITELY shouldn't spoil for yourself by watching this short. It's a shame that I can't just recommend it to anyone unless they've seen the first 520 or so episodes of One Piece beforehand, but them's the breaks. This was just a really fun surprise that I didn't see coming and just reminded me of everything I love about One Piece, while also getting a perspective on why other people may love it in ways that even I've never thought about, before. Absolutely watch this if you're caught up. Or at least at the halfway point.

"A very well-rounded special anime episode that is not only considered canon but also incorporates essential elements from One Piece. It’s the first new anime content I’ve seen from One Piece in a while since the Gear 5 episode. (Sorry, I’m primarily a manga reader so I haven’t done my best to stay up to date with the anime.) Animation is great—it’s the first one in a while that feels fresh, and whatever changes occurred in the Egghead arc really stand out. I appreciate how fluid the animation is and how much more detail they’ve added, even with the relatively simple art style with expressionsand movements remain smooth and impressive. Story is very easy to understand, a girl inspired by Nami is trying to send her letter, and the expansion on the Navy soldiers from Marineford adds a nice touch. I wish that part had been given more time. The episode takes place just before the Straw Hats reunite at Sabaody after the time skip, setting the stage for their journey together after two years. This timing makes sense, as it seems to set up the polished Fish-Man Island arc, which will follow soon. This special episode feels complete because it captures the comedic essence of One Piecee, a nostalgic reminder of how fun the series was before the story shifted to the final war with its more serious tone, OST during Luffy’s jump to punch down the cloned Kuma was also excellent, the way One Piece mixes lighthearted humor with deeply emotional moments is captured perfectly in this episode and seeing iconic characters return for this fan letter story adds even more charm. The “Fan Letter” feels like a heartfelt love letter to the fans, expressing gratitude for their continued support and appreciation by telling this small but meaningful story. 

I genuinely loved it. If it had been longer and made into a full movie, I probably would’ve given it a perfect 10 but whatever, I highly recommend this episode to any One Piece fan.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-20T15:54:00+00:00
"I loved it. The episode was imbued with so much joy and passion for this story that means so much to so many. We got to really see how much the straw hats mean to the people of that world the same way they mean an incredible amount to us; I was overwhelmed with such a loving warmth. So much of what makes One Piece fantastic is seeing how the characters change the world around them, usually on a massive scale. Getting to zero in on a handful of characters expressing how the straw hats affected them was such a tender sentiment to give us.I don’t know about anyone’s else, but in a way it was like getting to experience one piece for the first time and fall in love all over again. One piece has touched the hearts of so many people and getting to see that love put clearly on display speak volumes to the impact One Piece and its characters have hand on so many. I’m extremely grateful we got something like this especially with One Pieces end drawing closer and closer. I think a lot of people are going to feel like a part of themselves is gone after that happens. This will be a great episode to return to when one piece concludes, to remind us to keep our chins up just like the like Luffy and his crew would. Thank you Tomohito Ohsaki.

This episode is amazing for both fans, and those that have never seen One Piece. Those that hate One Piece for some reason will of course not like this.

Had me with a big smile for most of the episode, reliving some of the most memorable events on OP and showing from another perspective, all of that with proper pacing and quality. It gives a movie feeling since we have quality and a bit of non-canonical events filled with light hearted moments, but ithas a regular episode length.

Like I said in the intro, it shows things from fans perspectives, some new characters that are fans of specific characters, like Nami or Brooke, have an opportunity of seeing the crew reuniting in Sabaody and why they like them so much.

"This One Piece anime 25th anniversary special is about the normal people who live in the One Piece world and how their lives have been affected by the ongoing adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates. The animation in this special is done entirely in an absolutely gorgeous style. Director Megumi Ishitani has a way of capturing the essence of One Piece using very simple shapes and flat colouring, but it oozes so much charm and character. It borders on absurdist at points, prioritising the feeling that each scene and character should give you over what it actually looks like. I'd argue that the special is worthwatching on it's own even if you've never watched One Piece before. The animation is *that* good (you may find it difficult to follow what's happening though).

There's so much sincerity to the narrative. The way these characters look up to the Straw Hat Pirates mirrors the fandom for the One Piece series in the real world. With a show that's gone on for as long as One Piece has, it feels like this special was made largely by a crew who themselves grew up with One Piece and want to express the passion they have for it that allowed them to become artists today. 

I absolutely love this special. It's simple, but it's emotionally honest to a fault, and that's what I love about this series so much. The perfect way to celebrate 25 years.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-22T16:34:00+00:00

"Girl isn't really different from all of us. In a world where war is constant and everyone is powerful, what can we do as ordinary people to change it? What can we do to change OUR world? As an One Piece fan for almost 20 years something always felt missing for me since although the political message is there and we can resonate with a reasonable amount of the characters in the show, it lacked something to put me in their shoes. Then there's Girl. You'll cry with her tears of joy, you'll be frustrated with her, you'll vibrate with her, you'll go all over adventuresyou already loved but from a completely new perspective. All of it in mere 24 minutes.

Fan Letter embodies everything one love about One Piece and what makes it so outstanding for almost three decades. And the best of all, from your eyes, the eyes of someone that loves them as much as you do.",False,anime_review,60022,2025-06-20T00:47:00+00:00
"We, the One Piece fans, just keep on eating, to the point where you’d just feel bad for the other fandoms. Again, after a long period, Megumi Ishitani surprises us, along with Kisuke Mori with a timeless masterclass that feeds off an ancient and popular fantasy, what would it be like to be a normal citizen in the world of One Piece? One Piece Fan Letter is exactly what it would look like. Adventurous, larger than life, brutal, and depressing. An exaggerated interpretation of our own world. I feel like mentioning Ishitani’s name should have been enough to relay the weight and classiness of this masterpiece, butman, that does not do it justice. The direction, the animation, the auditions, the storyboarding, everything, the whole package is PEAK incarnate.

We go through the lenses of different characters through some of the events of Marineford and the day the Straw Hats reunited on The Sabaody Archipelago two years later, a few whimsical characters get tangled up in the whole thing and steam the spotlights along, a unique take on what many would call “filter”.

A very cartoony and bubbly art style was utilized, the same one used for opening 26 of the Anime and some parts of egghead, it fits Oda’s vision the most out of all other art styles used in the lifetime of the show, it makes you wonder if Wit’s The One Piece adaptation is not on similar grounds then we do not want it.

This was such a timeless short, one of those that leave a mark and you’d no longer the same person as before watching it, or at least, your view on One Piece will never remain the same. It’s a world that’s lived.

Overall: 10/10.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-21T02:35:00+00:00

By the time the outro played, i deadass had a shitty grin on my face with a few tears on the verge of falling. As someone who's been watching one piece since elementary school, almost a decade ago, this special hit me hard. The animation was smooth and fluid, and the art style they used was perfect. The music also was integrated perfectly into the scenes. Megumi once again delivers her best for us fans to feast on. Not to mention this self contained story was touching andyet managed to elevate the existing story of one piece.

One Piece really is a big part of my life now and I'm so haappy that this episode makes a representation of us fans who love the characters as if they're our own friends irl. We've seen them in their ups and downs and shared their struggles and happiness while rooting for them to reach their dreams -- it's just so magical. The road is long and the end is still nowhere to be found but I will never stop watching this show that is one ofthe reasons why I'm able to live freely today.

"It's a thank you letter to the fans who grew up with it, found comfort in it, and still carry those lessons today. You can feel the gratitude in every frame. It’s short, heartfelt, and somehow feels like the anime equivalent of the creators saying, “Thank you for being part of this journey” (╥ ᴗ ╥) ♡〜 One Piece: The Fan Letter reminds you why One Piece means so much to so many people. It reminded me that One Piece isn’t just an anime, it’s a journey that lives inside every fan. It’s less about the Straw Hats themselves and more about the people they’veinspired.

The animation also sets it apart. It strays from One Piece’s usual bold and exaggerated style, trading it for something softer and almost watercolor-like. It gives the short this dreamy, delicate, nostalgic vibe, like a memory you can’t quite let go or like flipping through memories of your own childhood. It feels different, but in the best way.

I love how they were able to incorporate all of the events in one episode (24 minutes). I also like the fact that we get to see the opinions of commoners about the strawhats. I also wish they could use this style of animation for the main series. I assure you that this episode will fill you with joy. Highly recommend especially if you are a one piece fan.

"Honestly, this episode delivers everything you'd expect from a title like 'Fan Letter' and then some. It’s a heartfelt tribute not just to the characters but to the fanbase itself. The visuals are absolutely stunning, but the animation doesn’t just look good—it actively enhances the storytelling (especially the use of light and shadows, Ishitani is so good at this!!). And while the plot might seem straightforward at first glance, it's packed with subtle nods to long-time fans, making it a deeply rewarding experience for anyone who's followed the journey.

While none of the characters have names they also play no vital role in the story as a whole and yet we feel connected to them as fellow fans of the Straw Hats.

"Truly a letter from a fan to One Piece. There was no need to actually show whatever was written in that letter, it was shown through everything else. Any avid fan of One Piece can agree that this simple spin-off captured the emotional attachment one would have towards One Piece, especially the Straw Hat Pirates. A re-telling of the arcs between the Grand Line and the New World from the perspective those in the background; either watching the events play out in real time, or just coming across a chance meeting. A nice little worldbuilding snippet into what it would be like for those background characters tofeel towards the crew. It was a premise that I wasn't expecting for a spin-off, but they executed it amazingly. It wasn't just a nostalgic feeling, but it was a cinematic experience that might just have you bawling your eyes out.

"My only real ""gripe"" is that it's nothing overly hype. But I do think that despite that, this is a masterpiece of an episode/special. Yes, it's about people who were affected by the Strawhat crew. And I love that there was a representation of us fans in the episode. It is based on a One Piece novel, but I would say it's more of its own thing than anything as it's far removed from that One Piece Novel. Overall, 10/10 great episode and an addition to the One Piece anime.

"The One Piece Fan Letter was a perfect way to say a temporary goodbye from the show to us the fans. The story takes place just before fishman island on sabaody archipelago and depicts a young female fan who idolises Nami desperately trying to deliver a letter to her. I view the story itself as we are the fan and we all aspire and idolise the crew, to the fan the crew is everything and without them we wouldnt all have banded together despite our personal situation’s or struggles to watch each episode every week. So just like the story certain characters lives where influenced by the crewdrastically changing who they are and their beliefs. 

And exactly like them we the fans have our own memories and sentimental moments we hold dear to us all thanks to this amazing story.

This special really came across as one big thank you to us and I personally felt emotional seeing the way the crew banded its worlds characters together in unison at the end as fans of the strawhats.

We are those fans and us too have seen them grow into what we have today and will we continue to support and be inspired by the crew.

"I stand up and applaud Megumi Ishitani, she is the definition of capturing feelings in animation, simply beautiful. This chapter was totally crazy, all the feelings that it transmits to us, we have nostalgia, emotions, sadness, goosebumps, happiness, among many others.

The story of this chapter isunique, a new perspective to see One Piece and thus understand many things, it's like a fan sees everything that the Muwigaras generate and achieve, the artistic style (animation) was SPECTACULAR, the color palette, the fluidity of how everything combines and thus demonstrates the true essence of ONE PIECE, it's simply beautiful.
In just 20 minutes they showed us such a great development of secondary characters that today in animes with more than 24 chapters they can't achieve and be honest, this is real.

"One Piece Fan Letter, Like the name suggests is a heartfelt letter to all OP fans across every corner of the world. It’s a true love letter that carries the weight of twenty five years of story, emotion, and adventure. For the millions of people who grew up watching Luffy and his crew, this special episode remind us that One Piece is more than just an anime. It’s a life experience. I'm glad that Megumi Ishitani is receiving the recognition she deserves. If her name sounds familiar, she the one that directed OP episode 1015, one of the series most beautiful episode. She understands OP ina way few directors do, grasping both its grandeur and its intimacy. I hope to be able to see more projects of her, she has proven herself more than capable. 

Going back to the episode, I actually teared up watching this masterpiece. One Piece Fan Letter, capture the essence of OP so well and remind you why this series has been at the top for so long. OP is about the people, about the relationships we build, the promises we make, and the dreams we chase. It’s a soft, nostalgic memory of the first time, I was still a kid and watched Luffy set sail.

(no pedo shit which makes it already makes it better anything post time skip has to offer) Positives: it is a very visually pleasing OVA and I think its cool to contextualize the story from an ordinary Jim in the world. Negatives: too short for the story they are trying to give so the story suffers and feels half assed, its tied to the One Piece, the cuts feel too hectic at points to just get some story then they give us along ass nothing burger cuts, adds nothing really to the story.

"Truly an exceptional work of art by Megumi Ishitami. Her art style fits one piece so much This show gives us a look in what it's like to live as a mundane person living in the grand line. The harrowing experiences of these people give so much more depth into the world building of one piece (which was already vast). It gives us a deep dive into the aspirations of these people and what led them to be inspired by them. If I were to point out a weakness of the show is that it just doesn't have more, even though the episode leaves without anygaps in the story, it gave me a deep hole in my heart that can only be quenched by more content about the mundane everyday lives of the inhabitants of one piece world. It truly exceeds all expectations, I didn't even think I would ever cry for someone who isn't part of the main cast, and yet here I am sobbing. I wish for more works of art like this please.

"One piece fan letter is a brilliantly directed, animated, and written love letter to the story of one piece. It manages to keep you enthralled with the beautiful animation and soundtrack, and manages to create a strong emotional connection between the audience and the characters. The highlights to me were the parts that focused on the marines, as seeing the marineford war from the perspective of normal navy foot soldiers was enthralling, and the characters we followed during it managed to establish an amazing dynamic in a short amount of time. If you are a fan of one piece, this is a must watch, andeven if you've never seen one piece before, there's still plenty to enjoy here with the amazing animation as well as it being a mostly self-contained story, although you will be missing out on a lot of fun moments if you haven't seen the original series (and potential spoilers).",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-21T11:49:00+00:00

"One of the greatest episodes of television I've ever seen. You can tell how much the creators of this episode love One Piece. Megumi Ishitani is back again after episode 1015 with another beautifully directed piece. The visuals of this special are incredibly dynamic and every scene is captivatingly full. Similar to epsiode 1015, this special hits you with emotions but it makes sure to demonstrate hope and inspiration. This is not only through the main girl's multiple references to Nami being her hope, but how characters are continually saved by the Straw Hats. One of the best parts of this special is despite noteven knowing the new characters' names, you can feel for them through their shared experiences. This special shows us the ""man of the ground"" perspective of world shaking events. It's chilling to see how Mihawk and Crocodile fight over top of dead and wounded soldiers without a scratch on them. Of course there are injuries are death in the main series, but seeing things on this smaller scale within one of the largest and most important events in the series is a little staggering. 

I think even if you haven't ever seen an episode of One Piece before, you could enjoy this special. Sure, you won't get the references to the Straw Hats, or understand the context of the events portrayed, but there are enough ""show not tell"" scenes that are amazing at demonstrating why we as an audience, and small time characters would be fans of this series.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-21T04:53:00+00:00
"Less than I expected, but it's still good. From the reviews I've seen and the rating it has on MAL, I thought it would be a masterpiece from another world, but that's not exactly what I saw. Don't get me wrong, this OVA is good, but it didn't impress me as much as other people out there. I thought this OVA was very creative in presenting another point of view of the world of One Piece, a point that had never been explored before (at least as far as I can remember), the side of the secondary characters and at the same time another vision ofthe world of One Piece. This OVA explores the perspective of the extras on the main characters, shows how ordinary people react to the main events of the work, a space that I can't imagine being included in this way in the manga or the main anime (because if it were in the main versions of One Piece, people would find it boring, lol). Anyway, I liked the idea they presented here, it's a short and fun episode to pass the time, about the animation style I don't have much to complain about BUT, I found the animation at certain moments quite strange (or bad, so to speak), for example, at some moments it's clear that the lines become very simple to make the movement of the environment more fluid but with that we have some frames and some characters with animation that is not at all ""normal"", and look, I'm talking about One Piece that has characters that are not at all normal, anyway, Nami also had a terrifying and ugly face at one point.

I conclude that this work is in fact good but it's not the greatest wonder in the world as it has been treated, I liked the idea of ​​the script and I found the animation reasonable since there are some moments where it declines, with that I end my review with a score of 7, I would watch it again for sure.

=================================================================================================================Versão em Português=====================================

Menos do que eu esperava mas ainda sim é algo bom.

Pelas review que vi por ai e pela nota que tem no MAL eu achei que seria uma obra prima de outro mundo mas não foi bem isso que vi, não me entendam errado, essa OVA é boa mas não me impressionou tanto quanto as outras pessoas por ai. Achei que essa OVA foi muito criativa ao por um outro ponto de vista do mundo de One Piece, um ponto que nunca havia sido explorado antes (ao menos até onde minha memoria lembra), o lado dos personagens secundários e ao mesmo tempo uma outra visão do mundo de One Piece. Essa OVA explora a visão dos figurantes sobre os personagens principais, mostra como pessoas comuns reagem aos acontecimentos principais da obra, um espaço que não consigo imaginar sendo encaixado dessa forma no mangá ou no anime principal (até porque se fosse nas versões principais de One Piece o pessoal acharia chato kkk). De toda forma, gostei da ideia que apresentaram aqui, é um episodio curto e divertido de se passar o tempo, sobre o estilo de animação eu não tenho muito a reclamar MAS, achei a animação em certos momentos bem estranha (ou ruim por assim dizer), por exemplo, alguns momentos é nítido que os traços se tornam muito simples pra deixar o movimento do ambiente mais fluidos mas com isso temos alguns frames e alguns personagens com uma animação nem um pouco ""normal"", e olha que estou falando de One Piece que tem personagens nada normais, enfim, a Nami tambem ficou com um rosto tenebroso de feio em um momento.

Concluo que essa obra é de fato boa mas não é a maior maravilha do mundo como tem sido tratada, gostei da ideia do roteiro e achei a animação razoável visto que tem alguns momentos que ela decai, com isso finalizo minha review com uma nota 7, veria de novo com certeza.",False,anime_review,60022,2025-04-10T07:24:00+00:00

"One Piece Fan Letter is a project that has been begging to be made for a while now. A short spinoff about some relatively inconsequential characters within the One Piece universe and how their lives have been affected by the Straw Hats’ upending the world order feels like a no-brainer in hindsight and fills the same niche as something like Twilight Wings or PokéToon does for the Pokémon franchise. The main protagonist’s unbridled admiration for Nami carries the age-old shounen theme of inspiring the next generation with incredibly moving and uplifting narrative drive, while the pair of Marine brothers placed as foils against Luffy andAce showcases the destructive power of Devil Fruit users and how seemingly miniscule the average soldier is by comparison, and the many cameo appearances from the Straw Hats and other One Piece regulars provide excellent comedic relief to pump you with just enough fan service without distracting from the anime original characters.
The true power of this episode, however, lies in its absolutely impeccable visual presentation. Lavish color choices, flexible yet immediately iconic character designs, intriguing visual symbolism, and jaw-dropping action all come together to craft a nonstop brilliant piece of animation. This is, quite simply, one of the best-looking things I’ve seen the entire year, representing One Piece as a whole perfectly in its creativity and ambition. Truth be told, the only reason it isn’t higher on this list is because I’m not quite as big a One Piece fan as its core base is, and so it didn’t fully move me with the same intensity as the aforementioned Pokémon spinoffs, but the fact that I still gushed about it this much shows how masterfully it executed this idea and how ripe for narrative exploration the world of One Piece is.",False,anime_review,60022,2026-02-11T06:46:00+00:00
"As a one piece fan, I'm disappointed. From how much fans were overhyping this I came into it expecting the best episode or something. In reality, it's just a cute little filler special full of fanservice; nothing to elevate the main material. It's nothing special. I couldn't care less about the new characters and their emotional struggles despite how hard and in your face the story tried to make me do so in the span of 24 minutes. Oda is also being weird again with that unfunny forced joke where the young girl tries to flirt with the drunk bar goers and nothing of valuewould've been lost just doing without it.

The visuals also look really cheap at times and I sincerely hope this isn't the direction that new one piece episodes begin taking. The music is forgettable, though it's not something this series was ever known for. I enjoyed the voice acting at least.",False,anime_review,60022,2024-10-21T20:21:00+00:00
"I'm not overhyped like most people here but I gotta tell yall, It's a decent filler episode. It's not great, doesn't bring anything new to the table other than fanservice. Actually, it's the first time I see someone portray the fanbase of something so well into an episode, that's pretty fun to see. But you have nothing truly engaging here. In 24 minutes, I couldn't care less about the nami-wannabe or the marine brothers. The greatest part in this episode is indeed the powerscale discussion, that's funny AF cuz it actually escapes from most filler-anime cliches and that's rare to see. As the name sugests,it's a special, it adds nothing to the main story, it only celebrates in some way. If you are unsure whether or not you should watch cuz It's filler, It's worth a try.

"Given how there is only one (negative) review, I've decided to share my thoughts as well and give it a different (more positive) perspective. So, this light novel series is divided into 2 volumes, the first one being 130 pages long and the second one being 230 pages long (around there); and so it is quite a simple and easy read in an afternoon or two. The first volume shows how ace got his devil fruit and how he founded and built his crew with several members being named and becoming somewhat plot relevant albeit only in the novel. This first volume follows Ace and Deuce,who is actually the novel's protagonist and narrator, from their first encounter in the East Blue until Sabaody, and their adventures. Most of the info on volume is new, but there's nothing groundbreaking in terms of importance. Nevertheless it managed to keep me interested. 

The second volume deals with a lot of things that were already shown in the manga/anime, like the Ace/whitebeard relationship, Blackbeard's conflict, Ace's execution et cetera. i do feel however, that the light novel feels more complete in terms of portraying ace's real feelings and emotions than the manga did, though maybe it is because it is all in a written format with no images and it is easier to portray those things.

Overall, If you like One Piece and if you feel curious about this light novel I'd tell you to give it a try. It's an enjoyable read.",False,manga_review,127114,2023-07-25T02:43:00+00:00
"Ace’s Story makes Ace’s character and arc in One Piece more whole. It offers lots of untold background and detailed life as a pirate. The first couple of chapters are very descriptive and you can feel the dry heat from the pages. This manner of writing is consistently found throughout the two volumes and makes the read a lot more engaging. An issue I have with these two books are the rehashing of One Piece knowledge we already know. It discusses things we already know well, and does so often. While I don’t mind being reminded of something, the extent of which this author takes itis a bit much.

Besides that, the new stories are compelling enough to override that issue a healthy amount. It’s a sweet tale, and a definite must-read for any Ace fan. Good stuff. 7/10",False,manga_review,127114,2025-10-20T12:51:00+00:00
"Completely forgettable. Some guys decided to write a spin off story about Ace's journey/Pirate adventures, or so it seemed. Turns out it's the same brief story Oda tells you in the original manga/anime. Ace gets beaten by Whitebeard, Joins him, Blackbeard betrays Whitebeard, Ace goes after him, fights Jinbe, meets Shanks. Everyone already seen this shit. The only new thing here is how Ace found and eat flame flame fruit, everything else is forgettable. They could've expanded the story in a whole other level, but choose not to do it. Such a waste of time.

"So, I like loli... But this is too heavy and goes a bit too far for me, it's too ""realistic"" like it's literally rape based on a pseudo-character based on the author... creep What really turned me off this whole thing even more is that I wondered why it was called ""One Piece"" and then at the end of the manga the damn author says that his younger sister (knowing he was going to become a mamgaka) had asked him to make a manga like One Piece... and that's why the name... Because he made a manga... with a similar name... and like, you can seethe irony he emphasizes. So I find it strange how Quilax's stories are always brutally realistic and always involve rape and kidnapping of minors. Either he's a jack-of-all-trades, revealing his adventures in manga, or he hates what he does and does it because it's profitable. After all, loli manga sells, and given his dream, and the way being a manga artist with a decent income is difficult in Japan, I imagine he resorted to this to stay alive. Anyway, I don't know. But both of my views on the author are equally tragic. But I like the realism of the stories, I just think it sometimes goes beyond what's acceptable.

"in this there is not any new thing, how can it be good then? the story is fair only because is a redrawing of an old chapter, and the beginning chapter was only fighting, so yes... not the best story. art is 10/10 because of boichi's art style, even buggy looks amazing with his style. the character are great and the art style makes everyone even more expressive than before. it was so much enjoyable, but i think that's only because i read the original chapter before.

"It's a masterpiece! The wonderful and exciting story of Oda along with the beautiful Boichi line, made this work of art! I'm a fan of One Piece and a fan of Boichi's design, so putting the two together in one job is just fantastic. I really admire their work. And there's not much more to talk about, just read to feel the emotion. The pages show the battle of Zoro and Mihawk in the East Blue, which take place at the beginning of the work, being adapted in this chapter, which I particularly loved.

"A great fight that's part of a great story, recreated by Boichi. I generally love Boichi's style and I've greatly enjoyed his previous One Piece works, but man I wish he would learn to draw a woman. Boichi's art is technically brilliant, and especially when he's drawing men it looks phenomenal. But I really cannot get over how derpy his female faces tend to look. On top of that, he's changed around some of the paneling and camera angles in this fight to be *way* more horny, making it look like Kalifa and Nami are getting each other off moreso than fighting in a few places.I wouldn't be entirely comfortable reading this in public, which is something I've never said about One Piece itself.

As for everything besides the art, it's the same as it was in the source material which is great. I haven't factored this into my score much since the point of this manga is the new art.",False,manga_review,145980,2022-05-06T18:22:00+00:00
"""Every time I close my eyes~~~, Boichi makes me so hoooorny."" - Everyone reading this one-shot. Another One Piece chapter remake, another chance for Boichi to flex his art skills and his ability to make most female characters super horny looking. When I saw the poster for this chapter, I think we all knew what Boichi was about to unleash onto all of us. And boy did he deliver. The artwork looks great, though maybe it's just me, but the action scenes looked a little bit blurry due to the number of movement lines that Boichi put in the panels. It's definitely not his most standout workso far, but where he excels is his detail scenes of Nami and Kalifa and their curves. Kalifa is 100 times more sexy than in the original manga. Boichi got us acting up fr.

The chapter skipped out a bit of the original chapter/s to focus primarily on the fighting, so info about Kalifa's Devil Fruit and other bits of dialogue got cut out, though I don't think it's all important for this remake.

Overall, I thought this chapter was good, though the only standout parts were really how sexy Nami and Kalifa looked.

The only reaosn this exists is for some horny boys to get off to but i can't even imagine anyone getting off to this because it looks so awful. The proportions are terrible, the faces dont look right, there's nothing here worth anyone's time. This one-shot just dumbs down everything about the fight and nami and kalifa's character to ""yummy boobs sexy"".

"Has Boichi... seen a woman before? I actually enjoy most of Boichi's fight scenes. This is because Boichi usually sticks in his lane and has men fighting because men are what he's good at drawing. Boichi really falls off when he does anything with women; they weren't well written or well drawn in Sun-Ken Rock, and they sure as hell aren't here either. Boichi is seemingly completely perplexed by the female form and is physically capable of not drawing the most horny shit he can think of. Obviously, the actual one piece isn't free from this either because Oda was the one who chose the outfitsand the one who can't seem to stop himself from increasing the size of Nami's tits, but you know, anyone can wear whatever they want, and maybe Nami's boobs are just growing naturally?? Boichi though, is physically incapable of not doing a close up of their boobs or asses for a single second, and for some reason, Kalifa's clothes seem to be a lot tighter than the real fight. I wonder why. Also, Boichi draws women's eyes weird.

The actual fight is pretty decent; I'd even say better than the one piece fight because it actually feels like a fight, not a conversation broken up by yelling weird move names. If only Boichi focused more on that, then fitting in one more Kalifa panty shot. This is made exclusivly for horny teenagers and even then why would you read this when there is no actual nudity?",False,manga_review,145980,2024-06-19T02:03:00+00:00
It completely tells the story of Ace. It shows how Ace acquired his devil fruit ability and also introduces the Spade Pirates and the first member of the crew to join which is Masked Deuce who actually just appeared in episode 1013 of the anime. The story is great. The art style is obviously as good as the One Piece manga. It's full of the usual witty humor and inspiring moments like all backstories of One Piece are. It completely shows the beginning and end of the life of Fire Fist Ace...and his raging fire. If you like One Piece and love adventurous stories then you'lllove this backstory on one of the most popular characters in the One Piece universe.,False,manga_review,128594,2022-05-08T10:50:00+00:00
"This artwork is so good I could die!!! Yeah Boichi is actually so good it's crazy. It almost makes me want to consider reading Dr. Stone. But idk. It's just a retelling of previous story regarding Ace which was already covered in One Piece (the manga at least) but it was still so worth seeing the glorious artwork. And it's only 2 volumes. So there's not much of a reason NOT to read this anyway, if you like One Piece. 7/10MAL wants more text out of this review, so I'm gonna pull out a strat only the real ones will recognize.

"This little spin-off to me is a very fun self contained experience and a must read for anyone getting seriously invested into One Piece. It gives us a glimpse into a subplot we never got to fully experience in the main story and because of how it was made, presents a snippet of what an alternate take on our favourite series could've been like. In any case, it's a fun bite sized experience that's definitely worth it! Story-wise, it has all the charm and wonder of One Piece. Plus given it takes place at the start and growing period of Ace's journey, it has that classicfeel of unfiltered hope, childlike joy and pure sense of adventure that early One Piece had. It's also such a nice way to get even closer to Portgas D. Ace, one of most beloved characters in the entire series. This also shows that just like his brother, Ace has all the charm and larger-than-life personality to carry the story as a protagonist. Plus, he's noticeably diverges from Luffy, so it shows a different approach, a wholly different path to becoming Pirate King! Not to mention that this tale lets us spend some more precious time with other vital characters from the story, most notably Whitebeard. Everything with him is thoroughly engaging and this is no exception. Everything you'd expect from a quality One Piece story arc is present here in full force. Amazing action, great character chemistry, emotional heft and that unique sense of humour that only Oda-sensei could bring (even though this wasn't written by him, which is a compliment to the writers, given that they were able to replicate his style so well!).

What really makes this manga special though are the visuals. Now, I'm a mad Boichi simp, so I'm more than likely a little bit biased here. I know some people don't like it when other artists draw a famous mangaka's work, but what we have here is something truly unique! It's a different look for One Piece that retains all the charm we know and love but gives it a type of fidelity we've never seen before! Boichi is an incredible artist that I feel is uniquely well suited for the job. His facial expressions are just as exaggerated and wacky as Oda's, but he has that absolutely impeccable technical prowess that, I'm sorry to say, Oda can never replicate, not in a weekly manga at least. It's the perfect blend of realism and stylization. The anatomy of the characters is superbly detailed and visceral. Every muscle, blood vessel and hair strand beautifully rendered. Already shredded characters are made extra ripped! The backgrounds and environments are rich in details, vast and overwhelming, truly conveying the insane scale of many things in this bizarre world. They help create these really somber and melancholic moments that I don't think mainline One Piece has ever been able to evoke in me. The movement is smooth and dynamic, every hit feeling fast and impactful. Devil fruit powers look immense and devastating. The lighting and shading are soft and intricate, giving everything an insane level of texture. Boichi really is a master at all of these things, but his diverse talents also allow him to be insanely adaptable based on the scene before him. He can draw hands, eyes and faces with enough detail and anatomical accuracy to befit a Renaissance painting, but he can also strip the detail away and reduce those same elements to cartoony scribbles when the time calls for it. This really shows why Oda-sensei personally chose Boichi to be the man to take on this task. That and Oda probably found a mangaka that's the exact same pervert that he is, but has all the technical abilities and anatomical knowledge that he lacks to make his characters look extra sexy. Also, it's absolutely insane that Boichi produced all of these absolutely impeccable chapters, not a single panel being half-assed or rushed, all while Dr. Stone was itself still running in Weekly Shonen Jump! I have no idea what kind of alien this Korean madlad is to achieve something like this. Hats off, that's all I can say.

In short, the Ace Story is an awesome experience that I believe every One Piece fan needs to check out. It's a charming and emotional story filled with all the classic action, humour and poignant character moments that make this series great. Plus, it's visually stunning and a unique alternate view into what the series could've been like, especially with the fun One Piece remix chapters included in the volume releases. Listen, I've grown to appreciate Oda-sensei's art a lot, don't get me wrong. But I can't help but think - if all of One Piece looked like THIS and had the same insane level of detail and fidelity, while still retaining all the wacky character designs and exaggerated facial expressions - then maybe we (or at least I) would've loved the series even more than we already do. Just a thought to ponder.

Be that as it may, I'm just happy this manga exists. Of all the extended media the franchise has to offer, this is probably my favourite. It's an incredible experience like no other and I recommend any One Piece fan checks it out. Just, do it after you catch up to the manga, otherwise the danger of spoilers is too great.",False,manga_review,128594,2025-07-14T08:05:00+00:00
